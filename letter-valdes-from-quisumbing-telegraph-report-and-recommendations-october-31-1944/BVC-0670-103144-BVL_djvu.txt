The Honorable, 

The Secretary of the National Defense and Communications, 

Tacloban, Leyte. 

(Thru the Fos toff ice Inspector)

Sir: 

I have the honor to report on the survey made between Tacloban and 
Palo on- October 29th., regarding . the gensral condition of the telegraph 
communications . 

1. All telegraph apparatus at Tacloban and Palo were all taken by 
the Japanese. 

2. We have no battery materials especially the jars as they were 
all ta en by the Japanese. 

3. There are enough wires along the road to put up two lines (one 
for the north and another for the south of Palo) between Tacloban and Palo. 
We may need some glass insulators, wooden plugs and brackets. 

4. We don’t have any splicing mate ials such as wire stretchers, 
clamps, plitrs, diggers, shovels and axes to be used in the re-construction. 

RECOMMENDATIONS 



1. To recover as soon as possible the wire3 along the road between 
Tacloban and Palo before they are lost. If possible the restoration should 
be made at the same time. 

2. If we cannot secure the battery materials from the Army such as 
jars, copper sulphate, crowfoot-zinc and copper, we may use a generator llOv 
D. P. for the main battery and 10 V D.C. for tha local which could be run by 
the local electric plant or by a motor of our own. For main and local 
batteries for Easey, Samar, we need dry cell batteries because of the cable. 

3. If we can’t secure the relays, sounders and keys we may use 
telephone apparatus in the meantime .
