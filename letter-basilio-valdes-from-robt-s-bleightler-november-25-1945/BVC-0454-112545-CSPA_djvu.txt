HEADQUARTERS THIRTY-SEVENTH INFANTRY DIVISION 


OFFICE OF THE COMMANDING GENERAL 


25 November 19 4-5 


My dear General: 

It is with great regret that I must take my leave 
of you with a note of farewell. I should so much have 
preferred visiting with you once more before returning 
to the United States, but circumstances have made that 
impossible . 

In leaving the Philippines I want you to know how 
very much I have valued my acquaintance with you. I am 
looking forward to our next meeting, either at my home 
in Columbus, Ohio or in the Philippines, should I have 
an opportunity again to visit here. 

To my farewell I add my warm good wishes for your 
continued health and prosperity, and for your success 
in your many good works in behalf of your people. With 
kindest personal regards, I
