PREFACE

The long stmggle for the emancivation of our Country 
is nearing its end. And as our cherished Independence 
approaches, as dreamed by the prophets and martyrs ^ of 
our race, important events are taking place in. the political 
stage^of our Coimtry. One of these, the most significavt 
and transceTtdental, is the Coalition. 

It is the fundamental right of every Filipino to ac- 
quaint himself with the motives of the Coalition, and it is, 
likeivise, the duty of the coalesced Parties to explain the 
circumstances, the reasons, and the facts that Ud them to 
this reunion to insure the f'l^its of Liberty, for which 
much blood luas already been shed, tremendous sacrifices 
made, and bitter sufferings experienced, more secure. 

This is the reason ivhy this 'White Book'' has come 
into being. This Volume does not deal in political con- 
troversies nor in partisan propaganda. It sinnply 
pounds in an unbiased manner certain fundamental truths. 
It is the purpose of the Coalition National Campaign Head- 
quarters to give in this book an impersonal exposition of 
the current National Ideal for the information of all the 
people and as a guide to those who believe in this IdeaL 
Notivithstandig its apparent diversity in form, all the 
material contained in this book adhere to a single idm and 
sentiment and reflects the initiative taken by the inde- 
pendent citizens who urged peace and understanding 



i 



among the political forces in conflict. This may be readi- 
ly noted in the speeches of acceptance by the National 
Candidates of the Coalition for the Presidency and Vice- 
Presidency, based upon the Coalition^s platform and upon 
the common history of the two coalesced Parties which, 
big and large, virtually represent the entire Filipino People. 

What is this Coalition? Why was it formed? What 
may the Country expect of it? As an answer to these 
questions, we respectfully submit this ""'White Book'' to 
the Filipino People. It constitutes, as it were, a pledge 
and a testimony of our devotion to the common welfare 
of the Country, over and above any other consideration, 
sacrificing upon its altar, as Rizal said, "all, even one's 
love of self^' — tJiat is to say, love for one's own party. 



Manifeslo of Independent Citizens 



The undersigned citizens of 
the Philippines, tlie majority 
of whom are of independent 
political leanings, beeing deep- 
ly concerned over the liberty 
and the welfare of the coun- 
try in the face of imminent 
changes of transcedental im- 
portance in its political and 
economic life, and desirous 
of contributing to the happy 
realization of the national 
purposes, have agreed to is- 
sue this call to the Filipino 
people and their leaders, in 
order to insure national unity 
and secure for the govern- 
ment of the Commonwealth 
tJie cooperation of all ele- 
ments irrespective of party, 
and enable them to shoulder 
successfully the gravest res- 
ponsibilities arising from the 
new situation. 

In other countries, when a 
national crisis occurs, when 
no differences exist regarding 
the main objectives, or when 
circumstances require prompt 
and decisive action of the 
government because a delay 
or a mistake might be fatal 
to the liberties or the inter- 
ests of the people, an imme- 
diate cessation of political 



struggles is declared, and the 
leading parties form a coal- 
ition by establishing a natio- 
nal government in which 
the responsible posi- 
tions are assumed by the 
heads of those parties. Un- 
der the presest political situa- 
tion in the Philippines, we 
must recognize that funda- 
mental problems, requiring 
solution, exist, that these pro- 
blems vitally affect the very 
existence of the nation, and 
that they should be solved 
properly and without delay. 
Tlie national parties cannot 
have differences with respect 
to the solution of these pro- 
blems. The Filipino people 
have before them a task 
which permits of no delay or 
evasion — to organize the 
Philippines for Independence- 
This requires the unity of aU 
the Filipinos. 

Just as in assuming the res- 
ponsibility of accepting the 
independenne law and prepa- 
ring the constitution, the re- 
presentatives of the Filipino 
people believed, with reason, 
that by maintaining the exist- 
ence of the parties, it was 
necessary, however, to assure 



thacooperaiSon of all of them, 
we hold that the foundations 
of our own nationality may 
be erected on a solid and du^ 
rable basis, only if the men 
of all parties participate m 
the direction and execution 
of the' great task which the 
constitution imposes It is ne- 
cessary to construct the na- 
tional edifice in such a way 
that blind and selfish partis- 
anship may not demolish it. 
The constitution, which re- 
presents the work of all, 
should be upheld by every- 
body in the same manner, so 
that the people may r&tify 
it without hesitation; respect 
for the constitution should 
be preached as the best safe- 
guard of popular liberty. At 
least at the beginning, the 
election of the officers pro- 
vided for in the constitution 
should be held without expo- 
sing the countiy to a strug- 
gle which would waste 
popular energy so much 
needed for more useful 
purposes, and which may 
finally leave the country 
greatly divided. Once the 
Commonwealth is inaugurat- 
ed, the government should be 
reorganized on a national 
plan to insure the faithful 
compliance with its great res- 
ponsibilities under the Con- 
stitution, serious attention 



being paid to the absolute need 
of practising the most rigid 
economy in expenditures . 
Economic readjustment 
should be undertaken without 
vacilation, following a well- 
studied and definite plan. 
This would require the pre- 
vious solution of important 
political questions, as well as 
an adequate knowledge of our 
commercial posibilities in the 
world's markets; and above 
all, a definition of our future 
economic relations with 
America. How to formulate 
and adopt a program of eco- 
nomic development which 
may be sufficiently stable in 
the judgment of the world in 
order to induce capital to take 
part in it and to avoid its 
leaving the country, maintain 
the stability of our cun-ency; 
promote foreign commerce ; 

mitigate the adverse effects 
which independence might 
have on our basic industries 
and the workers dependent 
upon them; and, finally, how 
to protect the workers in such 
a way that the standard of 
living for all Filipinos may 
be adequate and may assure 
general welfare, — these are 
some of the problems which 
we shall have to meet. But 
most important of all, we 
have the supreme problem 
of our national security 



when inaependence shall have 
been attained, a problem 
which at this time is upper- 
most in the minds of all Fili- 
pinos. In the United States, 
several members of Congress 
have been frank in expres- 
sing their fear for our future. 
Our own existence as a people 
being involved, we believe 
that the country is entitled to 
expect that the men compo- 
sing the national parties 
would frankly and unre- 
servedly cooperate with one 
another for its conservation 
and defense, by placing the 
question of our future secu- 
rity, as well as the other fun- 
damental national problems, 
outside of the destructive 
reach of partisan and pas- 
sionate controversies . 

Cognizant of the gravity 
of the present circumstances, 
under which, with the trans- 
fer of power, all the res- 
ponsibility for establishing a 
stable and orderly govern- 
ment of our own passes into 
Filipino hands, we appeal to 
the directorates of the natio- 
nal parties, and especially to 
the recognized patriotism of 
the men at the head of them, 
requesting that in this hour 
of supreme test for our coun- 
try, they unite their efforts, 
and support at the coming 
elections a national ticket for 



the offices of president and 
vice-president of the common- 
wealth, to avoid dividing the 
Filipinos at the initial step 
which we shall be taking to- 
wards our independence, to 
make possible the establish- 
ment of a government made 
up of men of the different 
parties, and supported not 
by a single group but by 
the whole nation, and to en- 
able that government to study 
and ^solve the great problems 
incident to the political eman- 
cipation of the country, not 
from the narrow point of 
view of the party man, but 
with the broad vision and the 
upright and disinterested spi- 
rit of the patriot and states- 
man who, upon assuming a 
public trust, may feel that he 
is being called by the voice of 
the entire nation.

Impending Critical Period 
Bemaiads Coalition 

(Salient points of the articlepublished by Dr. Jose P. Laurel) 



The well-meaning and en- 
lightened citiz:ens of the coun- 
try should welcome the pub- 
lication of the article writ- 
ten by Senator Juan Sumu- 
long. I join the commenda- 
tion of the press for the pub- 
lication of articles of the 
kind written by him because 
of their great educative value 
to the people. Civic patriot- 
ism, to be sure, is not want- 
ing among us Filipinos, but 
there is need of continually 
encouraging and fostering it 
so that it may not lapse or 
suffer atrophy. It is with 
this end in view that I am 
persuaded to analyze the ar- 
ticle of Senator Slimulong 
published in the several news- 
papers and in the La Van- 
guardia entitled : **Despues 
de la Coalicion, el Diluvio.'^ 

SENATOR SUMULONG 
NOT AGAINST COALITION 
IN PRINCIPLE 

Senator Sumulong does not 
question the good faith of 
those who have initiated the 
coalition movement. He says: 
"I have never questioned the 
good intentions of the leaders 



of the so-called coalition, but 
I am' deeply persuaded that 
they have allowed themselves 
to be misled by misguided 
sentimentalism." He adniits 
*'the convenience of forming 
coalitions . . during the cri- 
tical and crucial moments ot 
the country.'' He admits the 
necessity ^'of reducing and 
if possible of eliminating ir- 
ritating and pernicious par- 
ty disputes.'' Although he 
does not clearly say so, it is 
inferable from the tone ot 
lis article that the inaugu- 
ration of the Commonwealth 
is a "critical and crucial mo- 
ment'' of our history because 
of the serious and far-reach- 
ing problems that will con^ 
front the new government 
and which must be courage- 
ously solved by the united 
and patriotic action of all Fi- 
lipinos. In fine, he is not 
opposed to the coalition in 
principle and as a temporary 
political expedient, but he is 
decidedly against the union 
of Quezon and Osmena. That 
he is not opposed to coali- 
tion in principle is suggest, 
ed by his advocacy of what 



he terms post-electoral coali- 
tion, if there is to be any 
coalition at all. 

PRE'ELECTORAL AND 
POST-ELECTORAL COA- 
LITION 

Senator Sumulong divides 
coalitions into pre-electoral 
coalitions and post electoral 
coalitions. It is a classifica- 
tion sui generis, but by no 
means scientific the way the 
learned senator defines his 
terms. He contends that pre- 
electoral coalitions are form- 
ed ''for the purpose of over- 
throwing, for one reason or 
another, the party in power", 
and that post-electoral coali- 
tions are those formed either 
'*when no one political party 
obtains an absolute majority 
in the elections, and it is ne- 
cessary that two or more 
parties, those more or less 
related in ideas, band toge- 
ther in order that may be 
established a government'^ or 
*'when the solution of a grave 
national problem requires to 
make urgent political concen- 
tration and cooperation." 
Cariying out this self-laid 
premise to its logical conclu- 
sion, he makes the startling 
declaration that a pre-electo- 
ral coalition is unnecessary 
because "the minority, upon 
expressing readiness to join 
the majority, indicated that 

6 



it does not propose to parti- 
cipate in any scheme to de- 
throne that majority." The 
distinguished senator over- 
looked two paten historical 
facts when he made his ori- 
ginal classification of coali- 
tions, namely: first that 
pre-electoral coalitions do not 
arise solely out of a delib-.- 
rate desigti to dethrone ex- 
isting majorities and second, 
that "unexpected grave na- 
tional problems" to quote his 
own words, arise at no fixed 
periods in a nation's history, 
but they may well arise be- 
fore or after election: A cur- 
sory review of contemporary 
world history sadly refutes 
the contentions of the vener- 
able senator. 

HISTORICAL INSTANCE 

The present British "Na- 
tional" government is a pre- 
electoral coalition. And it 
was not formed to expel the 
party in power, either. The 
labor party which was for 
some years prior to 1931 at 
the helm of the British go- 
vernment had carried out an 
ambitious New Deal program 
involving enormous expendi- 
tures for relief and public 
works, so much so that by 
1931 British credit was sha- 
ken, the government nearly 
went bankrupt and the unem- 
ployment situation became a 



serious problem. To save the 
country and at the suggestion 
of King George, Premier 
Ramsay McDonald, head ot 
the Laborites, proposed a co- 
alition with the conservative. 
It was agreed tha the coali- 
tion was to last not more 
than eight years and it was 
then forecast that no less 
than four years would be ne- 
cessary to carry out its pur- 
poses. As was to be expect- 
ed die-hard Laborites and 
Conservatives refused to sup- 
port the coalition. At any 
rate coalition tickets were 
formed and submited to the 
electorate. The result of the 
elections was overwhelmingly 
in favor of the coalition go- 
vernment. And since then 
the coalition National party 
has vindicated itself by de- 
creasing government expen- 
ditures and at the same time 
increasing governmental ef- 
ficiency, by balancing the 
national bubget and restor. 
ing English credit abroad. 
Incidentally jobs were made 
possible for 700,000 unem- 
ployed, more than the num- 
. ber of our communists and 
sakdalistas combined toge- 
ther. 

OBJECT LESSON FOR THE 
PHILIPPINES 
The Philippines today might 
well profit by experience of 



these paragons of modern 
democracy. Right now we are 
on the threshold of a major 
political emergency of stu- 
pendous proportions. The 
Commonwealth which we 
must perforce establish dur- 
ing the transition period un- 
der the mandate of our Cons-- 
titution, must be the product 
of our combined and united 
effort. Upon the success of 
our experiment wall depend 
•the realization of our ulti- 
mate goal of political eman- 
cipation. But this is only 
aspect of the portrayal. The 
tremendous responsibilities 
which challenge our new go- 
vernment stagger the imagi- 
nation. Even as we are en- 
grossed in the storm and 
stress of political experimen- 
tation, we have to reckon 
with a sweeping and nation- 
wide economic readjustment 
incident upon the curtailment 
of our exports, the conse- 
quent reduction of our stan- 
dard of living and the immi- 
nent drop in our governmen- 
tal revenues hand in hand 
with the ifnperative expendi- 
tures which we must make 
to provide for our national 
defense. These vital prob- 
lems demand immediate so- 
lution and decisive action. 
Any single one of them me- 
rits the utmost concentration 
of energy and concerted po- 



litical action on the part of 
our leaders and our people. 
This is not time for mutual 
suspicion and recrimination. 
This is no time to sow the 
seeds of discord and disu- 
nion. At no other period in 
our history are we called 
upon to do away with vain 
wranglings and futile bick- 
enngs m our politics. To in- 
cite and provoke useless par- 
ty disputes at this crucial 
moment is not only suicidal, 
out also unpatriotic. 

WIHY PRE-ELECTORAL 
COALITION PREFERABLE 
Senator Sumulong himself, 
m his article, justifies the 
convenience of forming coali- 
tions, during critical and cru- 
cial moments, for the pur- 
pose of ^*reducing and if pos- 
sible of ehminating irritating 
and pernicious party dis- 
putes . But so obsessed is 
Senator Sumulong against 
tne proposed Quezon-Osmena 
union that he would subs- 
cribe to It only as a post- 
electoral accomplishment on 
the dubious ground that only 
thus could it be said to count, 
m a way, with popular sanc- 
\ i^^ores the funda- 
mental fact that the proposed 
coalition is being formed on 
the eve of the elections pre- 
cisely so that it might be 
submitted to the electorate 

8 



for ratification or rejection, 
as the popular will might 
dictate. Contraiy to the 
pronostication of Senator Su- 
mulong, responsibility will be 
better fixed in a pre-electoral 
coalition because once sanc- 
tioned by the electorate such 
an arrangement assumes the 
character of a popular man- 
date, whereas in a post-elec- 
toral coalition the minority 
can always throv*' the whole 
weight of responsibility upon 
the majority as the only par- 
ty charged with cariying out 
the popular will, having ob- 
tained the greatest vote in 
the elections. Besides, the ar- 
gument that post-electoral, 
coalitions are more democra- 
tic seems to be highly incon- 
sistent and self-contradictory 
when we consider the fr.ct 
that political parties are pit- 
ted against each other during 
elections pnjcisely so that one 
or the other party may gain 
absolute control of the go- 
vernment, and hence a coali- 
tion formed after the elec- 
tions when the people have 
already made their choice is 
an open violation and a wan- 
ton defiance of popular will. " 

THE RISORGIMIENTO OF 
OPPOSITION IN THE 
MIDST OF COALITION 
Even with the coalition, 

however, I venture to express 



the opinion that there is 
bound to be and there will 
be an opposition. But it will 
be of the constructive type, 
devoid of partnership, alien 
to that insensate political op- 
position with which we are 
disconcertingly familiar. This 
new technique is sometimes 
termed as internal opposi- 
tion sometimes as self criti- 
cisni. And to banish the 
spectre of the dreaded ''po- 
litical oligarchy"' the project, 
ed Quezon-Osmena coalition 
shall have proven true to its 
trust if it encourages its fol- 
lowers to criticise the acts of 
the administration to the end 
that mistakes might be cor- 
rected and blunders avoided 
in time. 

Upon the other hand, if 
General Aguinaldo is really 
in earnest in bringing about 
a new political formula by 
advocating a transition pe- 
riod of only three years and 
an abrupt severance then 
and thereafter of economic 
relations with America, an 
opportunitj'- is offered for 
the formation of a new po- 
litical party, with a new 
platfoim to be presented for 
approval to our intelligent 
electorate. General Aguinal- 
do and Senator Sumulong, 
indeed will form a formida- 
ble opposition group. 



COMMUNJSM OR SAKDA- 
LISM NOT NECESSARILY 
THE ALTERNATIVE 
There is no logic in the as- 
sertion that upon the forma- 
tion of the coalition, the only 
alternative left for the coun- 
try is either communism or 
sakdalism : ^ 
I understand that coalitifTn 
is a temporary combination 
for special ends bet^veen po- 
litical parties which retain 
distinctive principles and pre- 
serve their respective iden- 
tities, which fact is admitted 
by Senator Sumulong himself 
in his article. 

Senator Slimulong himself 
in his article submits the hy- 
pothesis that either all the 
members of the present ma- 
jority and minority parties 
will adhere to the coali- 
tion, or that disgruntled 
elements will secede there- 
from to organize a new 
political agrupation. The first 
horn of the dilemma is un- 
tenable for it is to be expect- 
ed that some actual members 
of the two parties at least 
such prominent figures in 
our contemporary politics as 
Senator Juan Sumulong will 
not join the coalition. But 
even assuming that there will 
be no opposition to the coal- 
ition. I do not see why the 
only choice left to the people 



will be to embrace either 
communism or sakdalism. The 
result wll be simply that the 
two pai-ties will continue to 
exist independently but work- 
ing patriotically shoulder to 
shoulder under the banner of 
coalition to solve the serious 
problems that are certain to 
confront the Commonwealth 
government. 

Granting without admit- 
tmg, that communism or sak- 
dalism is the only possible al- 
ternative left to the people 
upon the fonnation of a coa- 
lition, why should the pros- 
pect strike terror into the 
heart of Senator Sumulong? 
Uoes not the distinguished 
senator himself maintain that 

communism preaches ideas 
wiat are shocking to the com- 
mon sense of the ordinary 
Fihpmo" and that therefore 
thpT'",""'^'^'^ doctrines by 
eSS'^^f- ^" "ever meet 
^^i^^f'^stic and spontaneous 
acceptance among ourselves? 
VVith respect to sakdalism, 
Sf.^"^?tion is: Are sakdal 

ihllfFW^^^^ good or are 
they bad? if they are good 
should we be afrJid of^^sak^ 
dahsm?Andif they are bad, 
has the eminent senator, per- 
chance so little faith in the 
prudence and common sense 
ot our people so much so that 
he lives in constant fear that 
they would blindly subscribe 



to^ practices and principles 
mimical to their very exis- 
tence? Struck by the danger 
and prompted by the self-in- 
terest I believe that the peo- 
ple will if not at once, sooner 
or later, distinguish between 
a government that will pro- 
mote their well being and 
that which is destructive of 
their cherised rights. 

THE "NACIONALISTA 
OLIGARCHY" 

As to the "institution" cha- 
racterized by Senator Sumu- 
long as the Nacionalista oli- 
garchy "at times headed by 
Quezon and at other, times 
headed by Osmena," my 
observation is that TE was 
ushered into exisence as 
a result of popular ap- 
proval at the polls. If Que- 
zon and Osmena are oli- 
garchs, then the people have 
made them so. Elections af- 
ter elections were held and 
people ratified their confi- 
dence in Quezon and Osme- 
fia. Why? Not because their 
people wanted an oligarchial 
form of government but be- 
cause they find in these two 
men the good and requisite 
qualities of leadership. Not 
only the people who directly 
elected them, but also the 
other political leaders elected 
by them have adhered to the 
leadership either of jQuezon 



10 



or Osmena for more than a 
quarter of a century. If that 
is ohgarchy, let the people 
make the most of it. More 
than that. Carried to its lo- 
gical conclusion, if the people 
•should ever long for the 
bronze Caesarism of Mussoli- 
ni or the emotional racism of 
Hitler, they will have it. 
They are, after all, entitled 
to the kind of government 
that they want and deserve, 
"Why should there not be", 
asks Abraham Lincoln in his 
Inaugural adress as Presi- 
dent of the United States, 
"a patient confidence in the 
ultimate justice of the peo- 
ple? Is there any better or 
equal hope in the world?'' 

Senator Sumulong is cer- 
tainly entitled to give his 
own appraisal of the labors 
of the Quezon-Osmena poli- 
tical combination. In my 
humble opinion, it would be 
unfair to look only at the 
dark side of this "oligarchy,'' 
and close our eyes to the pat- 
riotic labors that it has un- 
dertaken and the beneficial 
results that it has accom- 
plished for the people. By it 
and through it, a stable go- 
vernment was established 
and the nation prospered to 
a degree which, according to 
President Harding, finds no 
parallel in the histoiy of the 



world; under its leadership, 
the great majority of the Fi- 
lipinos have not wavered in 
their peaceful struggle for 
emancipation; by it and with 
the people, the spectre of 
annexation or statehood, ad- 
vocated by the defunct Fe- 
deral party, was forever ba- 
nished from minds even of 
the timid and the foreboding; 
through it, national senti- 
ment has been wielded and 
solidified; it has carried us 
far in our epic exodus 
to the "promised land" of 
freedom, culminating in the 
approval of the Indepen- 
dence Law and the adoption 
of our Constitution in pur- 
suance thereof. Now, that 
We are reaching the goal, the 
cruel punishment of pur- 
posed "disintegration'^ shall 
be its reward, and at the 
end of the journey, yonder 
by the roadside, Senator 
Sumulong would honor the 
grave with the following 
epitaph: "Here lies the Na- 
cionalista oligarchy at times 
headed by Quezon and. at 
other times headed by Osme- 
na." What an ingratitude? 
What inscription, I wonder, 
will he dare place on the so- 
litary graves of the defunct 
political parties ever in life 
vitalized by his statesman- 
ship ?

COALITION PLATFORM 



The ratification, by a pleb- 
iscite, of the Philippine Con- 
stitution has closed an era in 
our history. It has ended a 
regime in order to give way 
to the e:itablishment of the 
Comnionwealih under which 
the Filipino people will prac- 
tically assume all the respon- 
sibility for the government of 
the country. 

The independence question 
has been settled. Hence- 
forth, all the energies of the 
nation will be devoted to as- 
suring the advent of indepen- 
dence that shall be stable and 
enduring, to the end that it 
may be an earnest of the 
peace and the happiness of 
the Filipino people. 

This arduous task calls for 
national unity and concerted 
action, free from partisan 
bias, suspicion and intoler- 
ance. For this reason, the 
Nacio^-^alista'Democratico and 
tlie Nacionali9ta Democmta 
Pro Indepejideiicia Parties 
conscious of their missio.n as 
the instrumentalities for po- 
pular action, have entered in- 
to a coalition for the purpose 
ot accomplishing the follow- 
ing program of government- 



I. Independence and Na- 
tional Defense 

We shall continue resolute- 
ly our struggles for the esta- 
blishment of the Philippine 
Republic, until success is at- 
tained. We shall persevere 
in our efforts to obtain for 
the Philipnines ^ terms and 
conditions that are more just 
and equitable in her relations 
with America; but in the 
task, w^hich we must under- 
take at once, of preparing 
our country for the respon- 
sibilities of an independent 
existence, we should depend 
mainly on our owji resour- 
ces. 

We have an abiding faith 
in the political safeguards of 
peace, and for this reason we 
advocate the entrance of the 
Philippines! into the League 
of Natio.ns and the neutrali- 
z a t i o n of our country 
through a treaty signed by 
various powers: but our na- 
tional security shall not de- 
pond on these instruments 
of peace only: .neither shall 
v/e l^t the burden of our na- 
tional defen^^e during the 
Commonwealth rest mainly 



on the United States. We 
favor the military training 
of our citizens but not the 
creation and maintenance of. 
costly military establish- 
ments in peace time. 

II. Organization of the 
Government 
We shall establish an econ- 
omical, simple and efficienii 
government. We shall conti- 
nue reducing high salaries 
and eliminating unnecessary 
positions and offices. 

In order to secure the 
strictest economy in govern- 
ment expenses, we favor a 
system of ample and efficient 
fiscalization. 

We shall give due publicity 
to the consideration of pub- 
lic affairs. Contracts for 
public works and services 
shall continue to be awarded 
to the best responsible bidder 
by means of public bids. 

We shall exact strict com- 
pliance with the constitu- 
tional prohibition upon the 
members of the National As- 
sembly and of the Cabinet in 
government contracts, and 
we shall make this inhibition 
applicable to all public o^ffi" 
cials and employees. 

We shall keep the office of 
the Auditor-General indepen- 
dent from the other branches 
of the government and abso- 



lutely free from all political 
interference. 

III. Public Finance 

We shall guard and keep 
the financial stability of the 
government. We shall main- 
tain and strictly observe the 
budget system provided in 
the Constitution and we 
shall not allow ordinary ex- 
penses to exceed the income 
of the government. 

We shall see to it that the 
stability of our currency is 
maintained. We oppose all 
drastic and precipitate action 
that may tend to depreciate 
the peso. 

We shall consolidate the 
management of various 
investment funds of the gov- 
ernment, such as those of the 
Teachers' Pension, the Post- 
al Sailings Bank, the Fnar 
Lands and other fiducutry 
agencies of the govei-nment, 
in order to secure a more er- 
ficient and economical admi- 
nistration of said funds. 

We shall make a complete 
revision of the system ot 
taxation, with the best avail- 
able technical assistance, we 
rJiall see to it that the bur- 
den of taxation is distributed 
equitably in proportion to 
the means and ability of the 
tax-payer. We shall make a 
general reduction of the as- 
sessed value of all real pro- 



perty, making it co.nform to 
its real value. 

IV. Justice 

We shall maintain a com- 
petent and independent judi- 
ciary, free from all outside 
influence, that shall adminis- 
ter justice promptly, without 
fear or favor. Ability and 
integrity shall be essential 
conditions in every appoint- 
ment to the judiciary. Wo 
shall severely punish corrup- 
tion and dishonesty. We 
shall simplify the procedure 
in the courts, so that lawsuits 
shall be neither costly nor 
prolonged. We shall assure 
ill poor litigants an easy ac- 
cess to the courts 30 that jus- 
tice shall be free and un- 
bought. 

V. Suffrage 

We shall continue guarding 
the purity of the ballot, pro- 
viding it with safeguards 
against fraud. We shall be 
inflexible toward those who 
violate the Election Law. 

VI. Civil Service 

We shall maintain the Ci- 
vil Service free from politics. 
Merit and honesty shall be 
the only qualifications for the 
appointment and promotion 
of employees. We shall ap- 
ply the rules of the Civil Ser- 



vice to all offices of the gov- 
ernment without exception, 
and so far as possible to the 
companies capitalized and 
controlled by the govern- 
ment. The prohibition of 
double compensation shaJl be 
strictly maintained. 

VII. Public Instruction 

We shall reform the system 
of public educiition so that it 
may be inspired by national- 
istic ideals, and consecrated 
to the formation of the char- 
acter of the citizens and to 
equipping them with social 
and vocational efficiency thus 
training them for the service 
of the nation. We shall short- 
en the period of elementary 
instruction and we shall see 
to it that no child of school 
age shall be deprived of edu- 
tion. 

VIII. Health 

We shall continue the work 
of sanitation that has been 
undertaken by the govern- 
ment, as well as the cam- 
paign against contagious di- 
seases and infant mortality. 
We shall keep the provincial 
hospitals open and we shall 
continue improving the care 
and treatment of patients 
and inmates in our asylums, 
leprosariums and similar in- 
stitutions. 



17 



IX- Labor and Social 
Problems 

We shall try to secure at 
least a living- wage for the 
laborer. We shall give due 
protection to children and 
women i.n the factories and 
in the field. We shall see to 
it that the conditions in the 
factories are healthy and hy- 
gienic. We shall maintain a 
progressive system of com- 
pensation i.n case of accident, 
and we shall try to adopt a 
plan for the protection of the 
laborer anrainst disease, un-^ 
employment and old ao:e by 
means of social insurance. 

, We pledge to regulate by 
means of law the contracts 
on tenancy in order to pro- 
tect the tenants from all abu- 
ses and to assure them just 
share m the products of their 
labor. 

We deom it necessary that 
a careful study he made of 
the social conditions in tho 
whole country, in order that 
a plan may be formulated 
lookmor toward the economic 
'security and the welfare of 
the masses. 

X. Special Proviiices and 
Cities 

We shall spare no effort 
toward the establishment of 
the same cultural, political 
and social level among the 



inhabitants of all the provin- 
inces in the Philippines, and 
for this purpose we shall de- 
vote special attention to the 
opening of a greater numbe" 
of schools, to the constructloa 
of roads, and the prortiotion 
of agriculture and business 
in the special province:.^. 

We favor the revision o 
the laws governing the cities 
of Manila, Cebu, lloilo and 
Baguio and other important 
municipalities in order that 
such laws may bo the bettei^ 
adopted to local needs,, an- 
in order that their p:overn 
ment may be more respon 
sive to public opinion. 

XI. Nationalization 

All the lands of the ptibli 
domain, all sources of powe^ 
and all natural resources o^ 
the Philippines constitute tiie 
patrimony of the nation, vve 
shall take special care tlia 
they are forever kept in the. 
hands of our countrymen. 
True to this principle, we 
shall look after the strict ob- 
servance of the provisions or 
' the Constitution regarding 
the nationalization, conserva- 
tion and development of na- 
tural resources. 

When the resources of the 
country so permit, we shall 
begin the expropriation oli 
great estates, so that the 
may be divided into lots an 



18 



eold to private citizens, pre- 
ferably their actual occu- 
pants. We shall encourage 
the formation of small land 
ow^'^>^''»in. which is the bul- 
wark of democrac,y the gua- 
rantv of public order, and a 
Fta^-ilizinjr force. It is our 
desire that every Filipino 
rhorli own hi,^ land, the 
house i.n which he lives and 
the farm which he tills. 

XII. Economic Develop- 
ment 

We shall promote without 
delay the economic develop- 
ment of the country in ac- 
cordance with a scientific 
plan first formulated with 
the help of the best technical 
nen, for the purpose of build- 
inrr up a well-balancod and 
stable economic structure of 
the nation. We shall e.coin- 
aofe the establishment of ba- 
sic mdustries, such as tnose 
of textihs, the preservation 
"^^d products, ai'd other 



or 



industries which not only 
provide ^viork to laborers buf 
Avill brinnr the country nepr- 

^^/.? ? '^oi^dition of economic 
fiufiicioncy. 

We shall support the orga- 
nization of the producers of 
coconut, tobacco, rice 
and other articles for the do- 
iey^ P2id pvonaotion of their 
mtor-sts. We shall provide 
measures to secure for the 



abaca planters profitable pri- 
ces. We shall help industries 
based on the coconut and its 
derivatives, and we shall con- 
tinue working for the elimi- 
nation of unjust burdens im- 
posed in the United States 
upon those products. We fa- 
vor financial aid of the gov- 
ernment to the rice planters, 
so that they may organize 
themselves into cooperative 
societies for the establish- 
ment' of mills and bonded 
warehouses and the profit- 
able marketing of rice. We 
shall exert our utmost with a 
vievr to finding a sure and 
profitable market for sugar, 
hemp, coconut, tobacco, lum- 
ber and other important pro- 
ducts of the country, and if 
necessary with the financial 
assistance of the government. 

We shall effect a coordina- 
tion of our means of trans- 
portation, suppressing cut- 
throat competition and secur- 
ing for the public an econo- 
mical, efficient and perma- 
nent transportation service. 
We declare that the Manila 
Railroad Company consti- 
tutes an essential service for 
the nation and it should be 
maintained and extended. We 
favor the creation of a mer- 
chant marine when the re- 
sources of the country so 
permit, m ovdnv to enhance 
our foreign trade. 



19 



We sliall see to it that the 
cost of public service of firsi' 
^necessities, such as electric 
current, gas and water, are 
I'easonable and within the 
ineans of the consumer. 

We consider it essential to 
the economic development of 
the countiy that a reasonable 
reduction of the rate of in- 
terest be made. The Philip- 
pine National Bank should 
take the initiative in this 
respect. It should invest pre- 
ferably in the country, so far 
as it may be safe to do so, 
the funds which it has now 
in deposit or invested in the 
United States. We shall 
make a .general revilsion of 
the tariff laws. We advocate 
a just and reasonable protec- 
tion for local industries. 

We shall lend our enthusi- . 
astic support to eveiy move- 
ment which tends to encour- 
age the use of native pro- 
ducts. 

W 



XIII. Institute for Nu 
tio2i and Scientific Re- 
search 

We shall establish a nutri- 
tian institute, v/hich shall in 
vestigate the food value of ou. 
products, promote their dev- 
elopment and foiTOulate a 
program for the adoption o 
a simple, balanced, whole- 
some and economical diet 
which is within the means of 
the smallest fortunes. 

We favor the merger of all 
laboratories of the govern- 
ment iji a National Institut''^ 
of Scientific Research which 
should study and apply to the 
development of agriculture 
and industry, the researches 
of science. 

XEV. Our Constitution 
The Constitution is the su- 
preme law of the land. We 
solemnly bind ourselves t 
defend it and to obey it, and 
we shall see to it that its 
principles and provisions are 
faithfullj^ observed.

Quezon end Osmena 

A JOINT BIOGRAPHY CF TWO 



PROVIDENTIAL 



LEADERS 



Born cf humble family, 
tho one from Baler the 
other from Ccbu, in the same 
year of 1878, commencing 
their education at the s?me 
•time in their respective 
towns, the one later attend- 
ing the College of San Juan 
r^e Letvpii in Manila and the 
other the San Carlos Semi- 
nary in Cebu, and then co- 
minj? together and preparing 
for the profession of law, 
Manuel L. Quezon and Ser- 
gio Osmefia present a sin- 
gular parallel so unique that, 
if they become separated, 
they invariably come again to 
p ron^'evo-mo- roint in obe- 
dience to the dictates of Pro- 
vidence who seems to have 
ordained that only in such 
happy union and close coo- 
peration, one complementm? 
the other, can th- freedom 
and hppn^'re.^^ of their people 
find consumation. 

LETRAN AND SAN 
CARLOS 
There are two colleges whose 
names will fifTure with dis 
tinction in the history of edu- 



cation of the Philippines b?- 
cause they have nfiven to the 
countrv its greatest figure?; 
today-San Juan do Tetran 
and San Carlos Borromeof. 
The fi^st belonged to the Do- 
minican Fathers and the se- 
cond, up to last yepr, to the 
LPaulist Fathers. Quezon re- 
cnived h^s secondary educa- 
tion in the first and Osmenn 
in the second. 

As Quezon was the most 
brilliant student of his time 
in the Letran College, so Os- 
rnona had t^e same dis^nc- 
tion in the San Carlos Insti- 
tution wh'-re he finished his 
Bachelor of Arts degree. 
IN THE UNIVERSITY OF 
STO. TOMAS 

The year 1894 found Ma- 
nuel Quezon and Sergio Os- 
mena fcr the first time m t^ie 
University;- of Sto. Tomas. 
Both took the same course, 
the law, and both immediate- 
ly arrested the attention of 
their classmates by their br-1- 
Innce. Being poor but bril- 
l^^nt, they were given tne as 
sistance of free tuition ir 



22 



University. In these years 
of scholastic companionship 
there developed between the 
two a friendship that was 
deep-seated and they seemed 
to have had a premonition of 
a common destiny. That law 
class of 1894 of that Univer- 
sity is regarded bv one of the 
Professors ''the most di^^tinct 
and the most rebellious" 
known at that t\me, led bv 
two poor free tuitioners and 
including such students as 
Ernilio Jacinto, martyr and 
hero of the Katipunan, Vi- 
cente Madrigal, Juan Sumu- 
long, Cirilo B. Santos, of Bu- 
lacan, and others. 

THE REVOLUTION 
BEGINS 

Quezon and Osmena 
studied together for only 
two :^ ears but that was 
enough to unite them for life. 
The revolution against Spain 
in 1896 interrupted their stu- 
dies . They were too young in 
years to bear arms. But 
Quezon was apprehended and 
broup'ht to Manila for having 
assaulted the chief of the 
Spanish civil guards of his 
town. Osmena wrote behind 
a pseudonvm in the liberal 
press of Romero Salas. 

With the Spani^^rds . van- 
quished, the Filipinos had to 
confront a more nowerful 
enemy. When the hostilities 



between the Filipinos and 
Americans who ud to that 
time had joined together to 
destroy tJie Spanish regime, 
Quezon eliliste'l in the Phil- 
ippine Army while Osmeiia 
used his pen in the columns 
of the pres Quezon was ra- 
pidly promoted and reached 
the rank of Major. Osmeiia, 
with his pen, attacked the in- ' 
vader in the Visayan press. 
Mascardo first and later 
Aguinaldo recognized in Que- 
zon a w^orth3r official and 
gained their confidence; Cli- 
maco and Maxilom in Cebu 
saw in the articles of Osmeiia 
an effective help and a po- 
werful insr»j-r«tfon amonir the 
fragile Philippine forces. 
When peace was declared, 
Quezon was a prisoner of 
war by the Americans and 
»s fate would have it, he was 
the victim besides of malaria 
thnt he contracted in the 
woods of Pampanga and Ba- 
taan. Osmena, as anoni- 
inous reporter, came to Ma- 
nila from Cebu when Agui- 
naldo WPS ret>'eating and 
Went on foot to find Aguinal- 
do in the mountains of Luzon. 
Ardent admirer as he was of 
Habini, there was forming 
in the mind of the young 
journalist certain plans for 
a campaign for liberty in the 
Tt^oalm of peace. 



23 



AFTER THE WAR 
\Vhile Quezon, without 
means, suceedecl in being 
employed as a clerk in the 
Monte de Piedad, Osmena, 
with Rafael Raima, Jaime C. 
de Veyra, organized in Cebu 
a newspaper, ''El nuevo Dia." 
But the supreme ambition of 
these two young men was to 
become lawyers and they 
prepared themselves accord- 
ingly for this profession. 

At last came the day for 
the bar examination and Os- 
mena and Quezon obtained 
high ratings and became full 
pledged la\vyers . Osmena 
opened a modest law office in 
Cebu and Quezon found em- 
ployment in the law office of 
Francisco Ortigas. He later 
left this employment to re- 
turn to Tayabas where ^ he 
took charge of a case against 
certain persons who tried to 
deprive his father of certain 
lands. Osmena, at this very 
time, also took charge of a si- 
milar land case which invol- 
ved one of the wealthiest fa- 
milies of Cebu. The aggres- 
sive manner with which they 
prosecuted their cases which 
resulted in their triumph 
showed, at these early days 
of American regime, indica- 
tions of leadership. . 



QUEZON AND OSMENA 
BECAME FISCALS 
In the meantime the Fe- 
derals under the new regime 
were attracting to their J).ui- 
ner the young mxen and the 
radicals. Almost simultane- 
ously they accepted the po- 
sition of provincial fiscal^, 
Quezon in Mindoro and Os- 
mena in Cebu, despite the 
fact that tl:iey were earaing 
m.ore as professional lawyers 
than they would as prosecut- 
ing attorneys. Later Quezoa 
was transferred to Tayabas. 
The manner with which they 
conducted themselves as fis- 
cals was very arresting. Que- 
zon engaged himself in a ro- 
yal battle against the best 
American lasers of Manila. 
At one time he prosecuted one 
of the most influential Am- 
erican attorneys, the owner 
of the newspaper ''The Cable- 
news American", who had 
appropriated the estates of a 
certain wealthy but ignorant 
proprietor of Tayabas. Pracv- 
tically at the same time, Os- 
mena was prosecuting an 
American shipowner of Cebu 
who had taken a number of 
laundry women of Cebu ana 
had isolated them. Q^^^f^ 
succeeded in s( zuvms the guilt 
of the swindler who later di- 
sappeared from the country. 
Osmena succeeded in secur- 



24 



ing the punishments of the 
piracy that he was handling-. 
Another bold prosecution 
which Osmena, 'as fiscal,^ di- 
rected was that against Lieut- 
enant Pendleton of the Unit- 
ed States Army who had 
killed a municipal policeman.' 

AS PROVINCIAL 
GOVERNORS 
With this brilliant record 
before them, these two fiscals 
became logically the candi- 
dates of their respective pro- 
vinces for governors. When 
the election came, Osmeiia 
was elected with greater ease 
than Quezon . Quezon had to 
struggle against the powerful 
of his province who could not 
comprehend how a man with- 
out financial means, who did 
not even belong to an infuen- 
tial family and who was onlv 
supported by the poor, could 
dare aspire t'o become pro- 
vincial governor. As heads 
of their respective provinces, 
Quezon and Osmeiia succed- 
ed in pacifying the people, 
the first with the disband- 
ment of a group of bandits 
Avith whom he had a perso- 
nal encounter in the moun- 
tains, leading a municipal 
T)olice force and aided by the 
then Major Harbord; and 
the second, Osmeiia, with the 
surrender of Chief "pulahan"

Tabal, a feat which was con- 
sidered impossible. 

The most salient features 
of Quezon^s administration 
of his province were his S3^s- 
tematic prosecution against 
"caciquism'' and his success 
in making his province the 
first of the coconut provinces 
of the Island. Osmeiia suc- 
ceeded in making the City of 
Cebu one of the best laid out 
cities of the Philippines and 
as a port of first rank in the 
south, and in initiating a 
program of road construc- 
tion. 

TOWARDS NATIONAL 
LEADERSHIP 

With the end of the mili- 
tary regime — with the war 
with America — and from the 
moment of the^ unconditional 
surrender of Genei-al Agui- 
naldo, the struggle for inde- 
' pendence in the realm of 
peace commenced. The Fe- 
deral Party which was then 
converted into a Progres- 
sive Party was in power. 
\^nien the provincial gover- 
nors met in an assembly in 
1906, there were only five 
Nacionalista governors : 

Quezon of Tayabas, Os- 
mena of Cebu, de Veyra of 
Ivcyte, Gabaldon of Nueva 
Ecija and one other. How- 
ever, in this assembly of gov 



4 

nors, Osmena was elected 
President. The five Naciona- 
listas succeeded in persuad- 
ing the Assembly that party 
questions should not be con- 
sidered. His effective leader- 
ship prevented the passage 
of a resolution which pur- 
poii:ed to ratifv national con- 
fidence in the chief of the Fi- 
lipino participation then in 
the government, Dr. Pardo 
H. de Tavera. 

PHILIPPINE ASSEMBLY 

When, at last, the Filipino 
people were given an oppor- 
tunity to elect deputies to the 
first Philippine Assemly in 
1907, the Nacionalistas won 
practically every seat, only 
17 going to the Progrossistas. 
The five governors of hardly 
a year were there and at the 
head of this five were 
Quezon and Osmena. Osme- 
na, over and above party dif- s 
ferenre*=^, po-ain was elected 
unanimously speaker of the 
Asseml^ly and Quezon b-"^- 
came the leader of the ma- 
jority, the right hand man 
of Osmena in that new task 
which was so decisive in de- 
termining the future destiny 
of the countiy. 

The government, from the 
point of view of the people, 
had changed completely by 
the participation in it of a 

26 



Filipino law-making body and 
by t4iat change it put i'.self 
on the road to immediate in- 
dependence . Osmena wa:J 
the* leader. 

QUEZON BECOMES 
COMMISSIONER 

Quezon and Osmena be- 
came at this junctur e p-eo ir- 
ated but only for the better 
coordination of the task of 
securing independence which 
was made an important 
phase of the task of 
the Filipino participation in 
the government with the in- 
auguration of the Philippine 
Assem.lv. To take carf- of 
this part of the work, Que- 
zon m.oved to America and 
carried the independenre cam- 
paign in the very halls , of the 
American Congress . Un- 
known and not speaking the 
Enr»*lish langua.o:e, Quezon 
established himself in Wash- 
ington. Our attempts to se- 
cure freedom for the y^y^" 
lippines acquires dramatic m- 
£st. in Aprn, 1910 Que- 
zon delivered his first ad- 
dress in English on Philip- 
pine liberty on the f^^or ot 
the House of Representatives 
0-^^ the United States. 

REDOUBLE EFFORTS 
The preL.entat^'on of the 
right of the Filipino people 
for independence had as- 



suiTied two aspects and need- 
ed redoubled effort. It was 
necessary to maintain stabil- 
ity at home, maintain and 
piotect OLii* conquests in self- 
government, Filipinize the 
government more and more, 
vitalize the entire political 
structure to the end that 
our claim for liberty may 
have a firm foundation. This 
work corresponded to Osme- 
na in the Philippines. 

It was necessary to invade 
the land of the conqueror, to 
carry the campaign in his 
own home, to bring before 
him continually the clamor 
for freedom of 13,000,000 Fi- 
lipinos, and to convince the 
American people of the jus- 
tice of the demands of a peo- 
ple who, by providential act, 
had been placed under Ame- 
rican tutela.^e and to convince 
them that the time had come 
to redeem the American pro- 
mis-e to give us our freedom. 
This task corresponded to 
QM^zon in Washington. Both 
co^^tmued to communicate 
with one another. 

THE JONES LAW IS 
EXACTED 
Quezon, constantly at work, 
succeeded in pushing the 
approval of the Jones Law 
in which America solemnly 
promises to errant independ- 



ence to the Philippine "as 
soon as a stable form of gov- 
ernment-has been established 
therein.'' This achievement is 
the best proof that can be 
presented that Quezon, bv his 
ability and by his patriotism, 
did. not defraud the hopes of 
his people. 

UNDER THE NEW 
REGIME 
Quezon becomes the Presid- 
ent of the Philippine Senate. 
With^ Osmena as speaker of 
the House of Representatives, 
which was the new name for 
the assembly, the two of them 
again v/orked together under 
the same skies and under the 
same party, Osmeiia continu- 
ing to be at the helm. With 
his labor of seven years of 
conquest for freedom in 
America. Quezon was glori- 
fied by his people as the bear- 
er of liberty through the 
Jones Law. The leadership of 
the party changed from Os- 
meiia to Quezon after a brief 
s'^ruggle had ensued between 
the factions of admirers of 
both leaders in an election in 
which Coiectivistas and Uni- 
personalistas had contended 
and at a time when Quezon 
and Osmeiia were both away 
from home at the head of a 
Mission in America where 
they waited jointly foy the 



results. The two wings of the 
Nacionalista Party were latei* 
reunited under the npw name 
of Grand Partido Nacionalis- 
ta Consolidado. Quezon now 
became the leader, Osmena, 
his right hand man . 

THE FIGKT WITH WOOD 
It does not seem now ne- 
cessary to recall that struggle 
because it is still fresh in 
the minds of all. However, it 
is necessary to record it brief- 
ly here in order to show the 
aggressive quality and de- 
termined character of Que- 
zon's leadership which was 
dedicated to the defense of 
the rights already won by the 
Filipino people through the 
Jones Law and during the 
democratic regime of Wilson 
and Harrison. Quezon and 
Osmefia jointly succeeded 
once more in bringing all our 
forces together and labor 
unitedly above the interests 
of party, as they did in the 
Assembly of Governors and 
in the Phinippine Assembly. 
It was at this time that 
the National Supreme Council 
w^as organized in which the 
Democratas and Nacionalis- 
tas had equal voice and par- 
ticipation. We have- said 
**air\ but there was one 
exception: General Aguinal- 
do. 



THE NEW COOPERATION 
With the death of General 
Wood in the United States' a^d 
with the government in Wash- 
ington already fully appraised 
of our i-'ide of the controversy 
between the American and 
Philippine representations of 
the government, Governor 
Henry L. Stimson came to 
inaugurate a new order of 
cooperation . The Stimson 
administration became a suc- 
cess at once which showed 
conclusively, if it had not been 
demonstrated before, that the 
Government of the Philip- 
pines was so convstituted that 
it could not make headway 
without the cooperation of 
the representatives of the 
two peoples. 

THE FRUITION OF A 

GREAT TASK 
Soich, in bold relief, was the 
great nationalistic task ac- 
complished by the two great- 
est Filipino leaders. It com- 
menced immediately after 
the last boom of the canon of 
the war against America and 
terminated with the approval 
of the Independence Act 
which now enable us to V^^^' 
claim a republic of our own 
after the period of the transi- 
tion of the Commonweaitli. 
The Tydings-McDuffie Act 
and its predecessor, the Hare- 
Hav/es-Cutting Law, are en- 



28 



ablin^ acts that make" good the 
promise of America embodied 
ill the Jones Law to grant 
us our . independence . And 
in this common labor, Quezon 
and Osmena worked together 
shoukler to shoukler, at times 
taking different roads in 
their methods of procedure, 
but heading for the same 
goal to achieve the same end. 

AND NOW? 
We are now at the very 
door of independence for 
which we all joined toge- 
ther to secure the moment 



the war with the United 
States was ended and peace 
was declared. This period of 
the Commonwealth is the 
last chapter of the common 
labor of these two great lea- 
ders who started together 
as young provincial fiscals in 
1904, as governors in 1906, 
as assemblymen in 190?. And 
now, hand in hand, they pre- 
sent themselves before the 
people to claim the honor 
and the privilege of temiinat- 
ing their joint labors toge- 
ther.

Speech of Presentaticn ly 
Senator Melencio Arranz 



Countrymen : — 

^ I consider it a singular priv- 
vilege to speak before you on 
this historic occasion in com- 
pliance Willi a mission en- 
trusted to me of introducing 
to the electorate of the country 
the official candidate of ^ he 
Nacionalista Democratico and 
Nac:ona!ista Democrata Pro- 
Independencia Parties for the 
Vice-presidcncy of the Com- 
monwealth in the coming el'3C- 
tions : that eminent statesman 
and distinguished senator of 
the 10th dis^;rict, the Hon. 
Sergio Osrneua, 

Thera are men who, because 
of their evident worth and 
merit, do not need any intro- 
duction . One of such men is 
undoubtedly Senator Osmena, 
future Vi03-President of the 
Commonwealth Governm.ent. 
His candidacy for vice.presi- 
dent as a running mate of 
President Quezon for Presi 
dent, of the Philippin? Com- 
monwealth, is the inevitable 
result of the logic of political 
events . 

Senator Osmena is entitled 
to occupy one of the highest 
posittions in the government 
which will soon be inaugur- 

84 



ab2d not so much as a merit 
reward which a grateful na- 
tion confers upon one of its 
most distinguished sons, but 
because, having, together with 
President Quezon, secul^^d the 
autonomy which we now en- 
joy, through persistency, la- 
bor, tenacity, and at the cost 
of countless sacrifices ; having 
placed our public finanoa on 
a solid basis; and having sti- 
mulated our gradual econo^ 
mic development during ^ 
trying period of our history. 
n h but just that the people 
themselves demand the union 
of the foremost loaders ot 
the country to take the 
helm of the upw government 
and guide it safely to its final 
destiny: the emancipation of 
ouy people. 

As the first leader of the 
country from 1907 up to 1932, 
and vn'th President Quezon as 
his chief aide, it cannot b3 
denied rhnt Senator Osme- 
iia directed the affairs of state 
with- foresirrht, act, andabi^i- 
tv. Under his leadership the 
Fflipinization of the govern- 
ment and the organization of 
our national enterprises were 
commenced. And what is more. 



when he was replaced by Pre. 
sident Quezon in the leader, 
ship of the Party on account of 
ceilain political events which 
occured in 1922, Senator Os. 
mena, displaying an exem- 
plary sence of discipline and 
loyalty, demonstrated clearly 
that a true patriot can serve 
his counry from whatever r)0- 
sition h3 may find himself 
whether in the files as a smi- 
ple soldier, or in the High 
Command as General m Chief. 

As a result of recent politi- 
cal diffarences, Senator Osme- 
na found himself in the posi- 
tion of leader of the opposi- 
tion. In that capacity, he 
served the country equally 
well, successfully playing th- 
role of a wise and tolerant 
fiiscalizer, but quick to rise in 
defense of his -principles i 
Those differences, demons- 
trate only one thing, and that 
is, that men of the caliber of 
Pr3sident Quezon and of Sen- 
tor Osmena may take differ- 
ent roads while pursuing ten- 
aciously a gve?X common ob- 
jective, but in the end, as if 
attracted by some magnetic 
power, the magnetic powar of 
a sublime ideal, they h?ve to 
arrive happily and together at 
the common goal . 

The pact of the two parties 
to present to the cleetoi-ate 



one national ticket is neither 
an artificial creation nor the 
result of political or personal 
machinations. It is the emoo- 
dyment and realization of the 
spontaneous desire of per- 
sons independent in poli- 
tics and of the clamour 
of the populace, to seek 
the safest way for the 
success of the great work 
of assuring the advent of in- 
dependence and solidifying its 
foundation to withstand the 
powerful attacks of selfish- 
ness and partisan passions. 

The cause of the disunion 
had to disappear and had dis- 
appeared. The people, there- 
fore, have the right to hoist 
the banner of peace and to de- 
mand anew the union of the 
two leaders, Quezon and Os- 
mena, for the good of the 
country. j 

The entire nation should 
celebrate this historic event, 
aiid congratulate itself unon 
the reunion of its two great- 
est political personages and 
the living forces of the nation 
which they represent. As for 
my humble self, I feel very 
happy to participate in this 
solemn act by complying with 
the high mission entrusted 
to me by the Executive Com- 
mittee on Proclamation, 

Countrymen : Senator Ser- 
gio Osmena.

Speech of Acceptance by 
Senator Sergio Osmena 



Fellow Countiymen: 

The solemnity with which 
it has bc^n desired to invest 
these proclamation ceremo- 
nies shows the importance 
we give not only to the of- 
fices for which the coalition 
of the national parties has 
nominated its candidates, 
but also to the steps which 
the country will take in the 
establishment of the govern- 
ment of the Conmionwealth. 

The new goverimient] 
%\Jiich we shall inaugurate 
shortly differs essentially 
from that which has been in 
operation up to the present. 
The government instituted 
oy Taft in 1901 under the 
military authority of the 
President of the United 
States, as Commander-in- 
Chief of the Army and Navy, 
could at any time be modi- 
fied Or abolished at his be- 
hest. The Cooper Act of 
1902 inaugurated the repre- 
sentative system through the 
establishment of a popular 
assembly vested with legis- 
lative powers, but in reserv- 
ing to the commission, which 
was composed of appointed 

86 



members, the powers inhe- 
rent in an upper chamber, 
and placing the Governor 
General at the head of said 
commission as its president, 
it restricted the popular pre- 
rogatives, especially because 
the commission was besides 
given the exclusive power to 
legislate over the territory 
inhabited by non-Christian 
Filipinos. In 1916 an orga- 
nic act, more liberal than the 
Cooper law, was approved, 
but in retaining the appoin- 
tive Governor General in the 
face of the totally elective 
Legislature; the new law es- 
tablished a duality of powers 
in the government, thereby 
creating a source of serious 
conflicts. 

True, the Jones Law car- 
ries — as e\7<erybody knows — 
a. promise of independence, 
but such promise, althougli 
expressed in clear tarms, 
gave rise to a controversy rs 
to its significance and fulfill- 
^'^^nt. It remained for the 
Independence Law of 1934 
to give us, not a government 
i^eady made, but the most 
complete authority to estab- 



fish such republican form of 
government as we might 
wish under a Coi^J^utution 
drafted and approved by our- 
selves. But more than this, 
the Independence IjSlw not 
only has decided the duality 
of powers in the government 
in favor of the people by 
bestowing upon the P'ilipinos 
tlie power to establish the 
form of government they 
may desire, but it has- also 
provided- -and this is Hie 
most important — a specific 
and definite process by- which 
the government of the Com- 
monwealtli is to becomle an 
independent government in 
ten years. Tlie Independeoice 
Law, therefore, brings to a 
close the controversy over 
the question of our indepen- 
dence by definitely dieeiding 
it in favor of the Filipino 
people. 

The men of this generation 
and all those who will en- 
joy the blessings of the Com- 
monwealth and independence 
would be guilty of ingi^atitude 
if at these moments of great 
historic significance they 
should fail to dedicate a 
thought to the preceding 
generations which contribu- 
ted with their efforts and 
sacrifices toward paving the 
way for the fruitful and bri- 
iria,nt struggle which culmi- 



nated in America's recogni- 
tion of our rights to be free 
and inde,i:<BndeJit. Full jus- 
tice must be acorded to the 
work done in the old Met- 
ropolis by the crusaders like 
Rizal, Del Pilar, Ponce, Lo- 
pez Jaena, the Lunas, Pa- 
nganiban and other Filipinos 
who strove hard to dissipate 
prejudices, redress injustices 
and raise the dignity of the 
race to th^ level of civilized 
nations. Out of that nucleus 
formed by elements coming 
from all regions of our coun- 
try was born the spark of a 
gmat national solidarity 
which in later years was to 
b^ transfused to the soul of 
our people through patriotic 
associattions. } 

Forericnners of Liberty f 
We should also give inl 
recognition of the tangible 
services rendered to the 
cause of our freedom by the 
anonvmous. masses ot* our 
people. AftCt' the intense 
propaganda of the forerun- 
ners of our freedom came 
the anned revolution in wiiicli 
stands head an l shoulders 
above the rest the great hero 
of our contemporary history, 
Andres Bonifacio, a man of 
action who blazed the way by 
the strength of his arms\ind 
the impulse of an unconque- 
rable will. 



•37 



It was no longer- a matter 
of secuiin<^ simpl'e' reiorms 
or palliatives to a situation, 
wliich had obviously become 
intolerable, for the purpose 
was no less than the libera- 
tion of the country from for- 
eign donimation. The Ka- 
tipunan and the revolution 
brought into practice the 
teachings of the fathers of 
our freedom and fought 
with courage in defense 
of the rights of the peo- 
ple and dignity, of the 
race. They made the iliree- 
century old sovereignty of 
Spain totter to its very 
foundations, and when after 
Dewey's victory in Manila 
Bay on May 1, 1898, the Spa- 
nish regime was reduced to 
ruins and embers, the men 
of the revolution set up a e-o- 
vernment of their own in 
Malolos and wrote a politi 
cal constitution for .the coun- 
try. But the governmiant es- 
tablished by the sword fell 
with the overwhelming txd 
vance of iKe American for- 
ces. 

Following the progress 
of her army, America estab- 
lished her sovereignty; first, 
under the military authority, 
and then under the aegis of 
the civil rrovernmcnt. ^ The 
leaders of the revolution vv^ho 
surrendered had to recog- 
nized unconditionally the 



American sovereignty. And 
as if this were not enough 
for the* complete disaster of 
the popular ideals, the Fede- 
ral Party procl Rimed the an 
nexation of the Philippines to 
United States as a national 
aspiration. 

American Sovereingty 
Thus was America placed 
in a position where it could 
exercise complete and abso- 
lute sovereignty. However, it 
must be noted that she pur- 
sued a liberal policy in her 
tadministration of our affaii's 
resolving to keep the P^^"* 
lippines for the Filipinos and 
voluntarily assuming the 
ral obligation of giving them 
an opportunity to participate 
in tne govennnent. Neverthe- 
less, what handicapped her 
initial work was her lack of 
knowledge of conditions in 
the Philippines, a fact which 
made her accept as true cer- 
tain erroneous beliefs which 
were then current. For ex- 
ample, it vv^as stated that 
the Filipinos were not pre- 
pamd for a democratic go- 
vernment, that because of 
the existence of many dia- 
lects and certain sectional 
characteristics they were not 
TQ^Wy a homogenous people 
but rather a conglomera- 
tion of different peoples 
and distinct groups, v/ho 



38 



possessed no cominon inielli- 
gent aspiration, and that if 
tiiis existed it certainly was 
not for independence. Thus 
it is that when the people 
decided to launch their se- 
cond revolution — the peace- 
ful revolution, which has 
brought us the Independence 
Law, by resuming in peace 
the work, Avhich was inter- 
rupted at the same point 
where it was abandoned, not 
only did every tangible trace 
of the ideals of the revolu- 
tion disappear but the whole 
country, impoverished by the 
war. rinderpest and othei'' 
public calamities, politically 
disorganized and left with no 
other party than that which 
advocated annexation, they 
had to face in the niidst of 
so many difficulties the 
problems of a full internal 
reconstruction so that later 
on, upon completion of this 
task, they could embark upon 
VL campaign of national re- 
vindication. 

The first to enlist in this 
new crusade were on one 
hand, men somewhat ripe in 
years but fully capable of 
assuming the functions of 
government in the munici- 
palities, and on the other 
hand the enthusiastic youth 
whom Rizal called the hopa 
of the countiy, and who 



were anxious to train them- 
selves in teaching so that 
they could take charge of 
public schools which were 
then being opened. Then came 
tlie provincial governors who 
at the time of their first 
election had to administer 
the affairs of their provinces 
at the head of a provincial 
board which had a majority 
of Americans who were not 
chosen by election. The law 
did not give the provincial 
governors undisputable ati- 
thority to maintain order, 
which was rather in the 
hands of the constabulary, 
but they shouldered their 
responsibilities and took 
charge of the direction of 
the campaign to re-establish 
peaCe ^^^^^ order, it beino: ne- 
cessary that the Civil Com- 
mission should certify to the 
existence of peace in the Phi- 
lippines as a prereouisite to 
the establishment of the as- 
sembly. 

Philippine Assembly 
After the governors of 
1905 came the first members 
of the Philippine Assembly, 
who organized themselves 
for the first time on October 
16, 1907. The success of this 
Assembly was (essential in 
that struggle and for this 
reason the first assemblymen 
exerted their best .to dis- 



charge their duties s:atisfac- 
torily so that the then Secre- 
tary of War, the late Mr. 
Taft, who held such stern 
ideas regarding the capacity 
of the Filipinos, had to dec- 
lare in an officcial report 
upon his return to the Uni- 
ted States, that the Philip, 
pme Assembly was a success. 
On the strength of this re- 
cognition the Philippine As- 
sembly considered it perfect- 
ly opportune to approve the 
first resolution declaring the 
actual capacity of the Filipi- 
no people for self-govern- 
ment and making of record 
the national aspiration for 
independence. This marked 
the beginning of a great of- 
fensive toward freedom. 

Time does not permit me 
on this occasion to make even 
a brief narration of all the 
incidents of this campaign, 
Launched under the direction 
of the popular representation 
smce 1907 until the approval 
pf the Independence Law. We 
»hall review these twenty- 
eight' years rapidly in the 
fashion of one who travels 
on an airship, to point out 
from above the landmarks 
in^ the scenery and thus 
orient ourselves as we pene- 
trate the new realms of the 
Commonwealth and indepen- 
dence. The government of 



the provinces, which after 
the convention of governors 
in 1906 had a Filipino majo- 
rity, was turned over entire- 
ly to the people. From an 
elective assembly and an i-^p- 
pointive commission having 
a majority of Americans we 
came to a popular assembly 
and a commission with Fili- 
pino majority, and from this 
system we passed on to a 
more liberal one with a le- 
gislature composed of an 
elective senate and house of 
representatives. By virtue of 
the act reorganizing the 
cutive departments the Ame- 
rican department heads ap- 
pointed for an indefinite 
time have been replaced by 
Filipino department secreta- 
ries, who are subject to 
change after each election. 
A council of state has been 
organized extralegally in or- 
der to secure an adequate 
coordination of the execu- 
tive and legislative powers 
and to make the voice of 
the Filipinos heard in the 
high council of the govern- 
ment of the nation. Thruogh 
the Jones Law a formal pro- 
mise of ijidependence was 
obtained from Congress. 

Schools Are Opened 
Schools received a great 
impetus. In less than three 
decades more school build- 



40 



ings were constructed than 
in the 300 years of the past 
domination. The teaching; of 
EngHsh became general and 
placed in the chai^ge of thou- 
sands of competent Filipino 
graduated from the recently 
established normal schools. A 
gigantic program of public 
works and public enterprises, 
including the constniction of 
ports works, roads, bridges, 
public buildings and irriga- 
tion systems, the nationali- 
zaiion of railroads and the 
establishment of banking 
and credit institutions and 
development companies, not 
only has developed agricul- 
ture, industry and commerce 
but has also stimulated inter- 
island migration and promo- 
ted peace and order. 

With th^ implantation of 
tVe budget' system the sound- 
ness of the government fi- 
nances has been maintained. 
Obligations arising out of 
the public debt have been re- 
ligiously paid. Social v/el- 
fare problems have been at- 
tended to and through a well- 
rounded program of sanita- 
tion, the establishment ' of 
hospitals and maternity 
wards, and the campaign 
against Infant mortality, 
the population of the Islancls 
has been doubled in such a 
short time. An independent 

41 



judiciary has been establish- 
ed to administer justice with- 
out fear or favor, to be^tlie 
bulwark of the rights of all 
residents of this country, 
Filipinos as well as Ameri- 
cans and foreigners. 



The Civil Service 
The civil service has beei 
cstablisiied on the basis of 
merit, while the Filipinization 
policy has been carried out 
without hesitation or iric- 
tion. Peace and order have 
been maintained with etti- 
ciency by the civil forces of 
the insular Government, ^^e- 
ver before has there beei| 
crrcater harmony between Fi^ 
iipino Christians and Moha- 
mmedans. Attempts at ter- 
ritorial dismemberment have 
failed, just as the efforts to 
present the Filipino people 
as a disorganized group of 
scattered and hostile tribes 
has failed. At last, the exis- 
tence of a homogeneous Fili- 
pino people has been justly^ 
recognized. 

Missio'iis to America 
And when this vast work' 
of national reconstniction 
had been completed and the 
existence of a stable govern- 
ment in the country had be- 
come an admitted fact, the 
offensive for freedom ad- 
va.nced with greater determi- 



nation and vision to a new- 
front, the United States, 0,n 
the new battle-line were in- 
trenched the parliamentary 
missions which had to over- 
come the systematic opposi- 
sition to the cause or the in- 
difference to it, which was 
at tmies worse than the on- 
position itself. Despite the 
obstacles and difficulties 
they confranted, the missio- 
ners never lost heart nor 
faith and one after another 
continued the campaign 
without respite,, until finafly 
they were able to arouse the 
interest and sympathy of the 
American Con^^ress: Some 
people beheve that our m?s 
sions would have woefuilt 
wasted their time we^^ i^S

- no doubt that thes/^ref 
ments as well as other! wei-e 
an important factor had to 
be reckoned with in the 
fight, but it would be a 
grave injustice to ascribe the 
result of our campaign exclu- 
sively to the influence of 
these elements. Th^ decision 



of the Philippine question by 
Congress was not due solely 
to the influence of selfish in- 
jerests but principally to 
the decisive action of the 
moral forces which in Ame- 
rica ultimately decide the 
big issues affecting human 
liberty. Thus did Congress, 
ignoring the excessive de- 
mands of certain American 
interests, passed a law which, 
in spite of its limitations and 
restrictions, it is to a certain 
extent liberal and undoubt- 
edly, as an independence law, 
the*^ best obtainable under the 
circumstances. 

Easy to Criticize 
We have made this brief 
review of our campaign be- 
cause man usually has a 
weak memory and when he 
is blinded by passion he easi- 
ly forgets the efforts and 
sacrifices made, which have 
been instrumental in bring- 
ing about the present situa- 
tion and opening up the fu- 
ture for us. It is easy to 
criticize the work of others 
and belittle their achieve- 
ments when one has not ta- 
ken part in the difficult task 
of attainhig them. Bv this I 
mean that after weeping 
over our common defeat — the 
failure of the Filinino arms 
— the leader of thp revolu- 
tion accepted the terms of 

42 



peace imcanditionally and 
turned his back on the war 
for independence. So uncon- 
cMtional was the surrender 
that the Filipino people did 
not obtain from America 
even the promire of a re- 
mote independence. 

First, the people, and then 
the popular representation, 
were the ones who picked up 
the ideal which had besn cast 
aside, and defended it in the 
realms of law and peace. A 
challenge was hurled to us^ 
to prove our capacity for 
self-g'overnment. We accept- 
ed the challenge and proved 
our capacity. While W3 are 
engaged in the governmen- 
tal work of }'e'.iabilitating 
the country in all lines of its 
Vfe and nativities and mak- 
ing possible its amazing 
progress avt:\ined in the last 
twenty-eight years, in the 
orderly process of our own 
govermcnt we won. inch by 
inr^h, povvers for the people 
aiiifl defended each gain we 
made from the onslaughts of 
reaction. Every . redonbt that 
was conquered served as bul- 
wark to win the next. The 
pl^d^re o f indep^3ndence 
which we failed to secure by 
force. We obtainei through 
our peaceful and friendly ne- 
gotations with America, con- 
ducted by the leaders of 



peace with the support of a 
people united in their de- 
mands for freedom. Thanks 
to consistent efforts, we have 
finally achieved, after sur- 
mouniing untold difficulties 
and after seventeen years 
since this premises was se- 
cured, the approval by Con- 
gress of the Independence 
Lnw, which is the crowning 
glory of our campaign for 
freedom. 

It has been :ny except ional 
luck to have been associated 
in all those struggles with 
the statesman and patriot 
who is now at ' the head of 
the Filipino participation in 
the government and who has 
been nominated by the two 
coalesced national parties for 
the highest position in the 
nation. I deem it a great 
honor to ha^ a part in this 
crndidr^Cy and upon being 
officially notified of my no- 
mination I wish to say that 
I arn ready to accept it. I 
accept it with profound gra- 
titude, with the same spirit 
of sacrifice and the same 
sense of resnonsibilitV with 
which, I belive, 1 have res- 
ponded to the call of our 
country to the various of- 
fices entrusted to me in the 
last thirty years. 

FoT' the share I have had, 
humble as it may have been. 



ijL the national enterprise of 
our liberation, which will 
find its cnIminat,ion in the 
ushering in of the Common- 
wealth and independence, I 
pledge myself solemnly to the 
task of helping and coopera- 
ting actively, according to 
my limited capabilities and 
possibilities, in the realiza- 
tion of the program of go- 
verament as adopted by the 
coalition and as it will be set 
forth in detail in the speech 
of acceptance of our candi- 



date for President — a prog- 
ram which I believe will in- 
sure the success of the Com- 
monwealth aaid will make our 
independence which if as the 
day follows the dawn wiU 
come after the Common- 
wealth, enduring and ins- 
trumental in promoting the 
welfare, peace and happiness 
of the masses of our people 
and of all men of good will 
who may choose to live with 
us. 

Manila, July 20, 1935 



44 



speech of Prefentation by Ex- 
Senator Beni^no S. Aquino 



Fellow countrymen: 

We nre in the most criticsil 
period of our history. The 
happy and unanimous ac. 
cepiance by the Legislature 
of the Tydings-McDuffie law 
has tempered the hated po- 
litical contest provoked by 
the HHC issue. As the ex. 
cited passions calmed down, 
we were impelled to look for- 
ward to the future with the 
welfare of our country at 
heart. The acceptance of 
the T-M law was the most 
eloquent evidence of the good 
faith and honesty of all 
those who engaged in that 
heated affray and who, as 
later developments have 
shown, had no other object- 
ive but to seek the safest way 
for the attainment of our 
freedom. 

However, there lurked in 
the minds of not a few in- 
dividuals, like an ominous 
question sketched on the 
sha,dow of mystery, a doubt 
as to whether there was 
any intention of securing the 
fulfillment of all the provi. 
sions of the accepted law 
This doubt was accentuated 



by certain unfortunate decla- 
rations made by a resident 
commissioner in Washington 
nnd trnsmitted here by cable. 
To reassure the already dis- 
turbed mind of the masses, 
a group of ^'Independent Ci- 
tizens'' launched the idea of 
a coalition of the political 
parties, an idea which was 
immediately accepted in prin- 
ciple by the leaders of the 
two biggest political parties, 
because with it all doubis 
would disappear and the sin- 
cerity of purpose established. 

The acceptance of the coa- 
lition gave rise to certain 
selfish inquiries: What ad- 
vantage, some said, would 
the majorit^^ party get out of 
such a coalition? On the 
other hand, there were not 
wanting in the minority in- 
dividuals who asked similar 
question: Wliat benefits, they 
asked, would the minority 
derived from such an alli- 
ance ? Countrjrmen : These 
are times when we must cast 
aside all selfish interests, 
whether of individuals, of 
groups, or of parties, to en- 
able us to render homage to 



45 



the interests of the nation. 
This has been the reaction 
of all nations when faced 
with momentous issues, i.ncl 
this has been the reaction 
we gallantly demonstrated 
when we framed tne Philip- 
pine Constitution. 
Inspired by this ideal, the 
Nacionalista - Do'mocratico 
Party and the Nacionahsta- 
Democrata Pro-Independencia 
Party, renouncing all for 
Country, approved the coa- 
lition without any mental re- 
servations so as to be 
able unitedly to begin 
the patriotic task of build- 
ing a firm basis for the 
Commonwealth Government 
and thus assure for the Fi- 
. lipinos the prompt covent of 
Independence and the bless- 
ings of a lasting liberty. 

Can any Filipino who loves 
his country, close his eyes to 
the grave social, economic 
and external probleiris thai' 
confront the nation in this, 
the beginning: of its new 
life? To be able to meet such 
an uncertaui situation, the 
cooperation of all is required 
and it would be an useless 
waste of energy to engage in. 
cheap and bcasriul claims 
of patriotism and discussions 
that instead of giving us the 
lio:ht may produce darkness 
which may lead us to perdi- 



tion. Wh?t would we say of 
t^^^o l-)roLhe3*s who, when 
their house is burning, en- 
gaged in a futile discussiorf 
on who should enjoy the 
v/calth of their parents? 
We would say that they 
sought their own ruin. 

History teaches us that 
each period in the struggle 
of a nation for cmancipa- 
ion demands a certain type 
of leadership, Rizal did not 
refuse to sacrifice his life in 
Bagumbayan to awaken his 
people from the lethargy 
that gripped them. He said: 
Open the bottle to release the 
perfume. The violent means 
employed hy the sovereign 
power here in 1896 to per- 
petuate its hold on us just- 
ified the use of Bonifacio's 
bolo in the name of liberty; 
there was no way to fight 
force except with force. To- 
day, however, the leader 
must be cultured man-pos 
scssed of intelligence, pers- 
picacity, and a profound 
knowledge of the problems 
of the present. The Phil- 
irnines v/as placed by the 
Almighty at the crossroads 
of vast and important seaa, 
and she can In no wav ' ide 
the influence of pov^^erful na- 
tions. We need a leader who 
is possessed of a vigilant 
spirit, has dedicated to the 



46 



study of the tendendes and 
designs of the countries that 
surround us Or whose sphere 
of infkience extends almost 
to our shores. We need a 
leader who is well informed 
on internattional trends, 
that determine tlie march of 
events in the entire world, 
and who, by reason of his 
personality and leadership, 
has had the privilege of 
meeting the men at the hoad 
of other nations. Fortunate- 
ly for the Philippines, we 
have such a man — a man who 
has all these requirements 
and many more — a man who 
combines the ability of a 
statesma.n and the personali- 
ty that inspires the confi- 
dence of the masses^ — a man 
whose repeated triumphs 
have demonstrated his peo- 
ple's faith in him. All these 



qualities make him the mosti 
appropriate choice to lead his 
country in the first step I'o- 
wards complete liberty. Th's 
man is MANUEL L. QUE- 
ZON. 

With a full knowledge of 
these facts, the national con- 
ventions of the two parties 
now joined in a coalition, 
have unanimously nominated 
him as official candidate of 
the coalition for the Presi- 
dency of the Commonwealth. 

Therefore, in the name 
of the coalition, I have the 
honor to officially notifv the 
Hon. MANUEL L. QUE- 
ZON of his nomination as 
official candidate of the coa- 
lition for the Presidency of 
the Commonwealth. 

Fellow countr3Tnen: I now 
present to you MANUEL 
L. QUEZON. 



Speech of Acceptance by Hon. 
Manuel L. Quezon, FresMeimt 

of the Senate 

— — 



Mr. Chairmman, Gentlemen 

of the Committee, 

Fellovz-Citizens : 

A Party nomination for 
the highest office within the 
jift of the people is in itself 
a great distinction, but 
when the nomination conies 
under such auspicious cir- 
cumstances as have attended 
that which is now proferred 
to me, I regard it as the 
greatest honor that can be 
accorded to any public man 
short alone of his actual el- 
ection to the Presidency. 

Commomvealth 

Responsibilities 

Ever since the approval and 
acceptance of the independ- 
ence Act there has been 
gi-owing among the people a 
feeUng of deepest concern 
ove}' the difficult problems 
and impending responsibili- 
ties which will confront us 
upon the inauguration of the 
Commonwealth. While the 
Gonsti tutional Convention 
was in session, partly fos- 
tered by the spirit of nation- 
al solidarity exhibited by the 

48 



members of that body, the 
anxiety to prepare the coun- 
try adequately to meet these 
problems and responsibilities 
became articulate in an in- 
creasingly popular demand 
for national unity — , that po- 
litical parties give pause to 
partisan strife, that the lea- 
ders of the vital forces of 
the nation join in their ef- 
forts for the attainment of 
the common goal, and that 
the entire country resolve to 
support loyally the man 
who may be entrusted with 
the national leadership so 
that through the govern- 
ment of the Commonwealth 
the foundations of the future 
Philippine Republic may be 
solidly and firmly establish- 
ed. Resolutions were passed 
by Municipal Councils as 
well as by civic and social 
organizations, including la- 
bor union§, demanding a coa- 
lition of the two great poli- 
tical parties as the most 
practical means of obtaining 
this unity of effort. Before 
the Constitutional Convention 
adjourned the cry of nation- 



al unity was taken up by the 
League of Provincial Gov- 
ernors. Without regard to 
party affiliation and voicing 
the prevailing sentiment in 
their respective provinces, 
these spokesmen of our lo- 
cal governments unanimous- 
ly joined in the general ap- 
peal for unity. Lastly, pro- 
minent Filipino businessmen, 
professionals and leaders in 
agriculture, industry and la- 
bor formally submitted to the 
directorate of the two politi- 
cal parties a concrete propo- 
sal that the two parties no- 
minate jointly the candidates 
for President and Vice-Pres- 
ident and thus insure the 
cooperation of all the vital 
forces of the nation during 
the first and trying years of 
the Commonwealth. When 

the two parties held their 
respective national conven- 
tions they readily responded 
to this popular clamor and 
forthwith agreed to form a 
coalition and to nominate the 
same candidate for President 
and Vice-President. 

Nominations JJnsotight 
Neither Sen. Osmeiia ncr 
I sought these nominations. 
We made no pre-convention 
campaign nor did we liave 
any desire to secure them. 
We entered public life about 
the s^me time thirty years ago 



both pledged to the cans? of 
independence. The vicissi- 
tudes wliich have been our 
lot during these years are not 
now to be recounted, but as 
I look back upon our joint 
efforts in the attainment of 
the goal which we set out be- 
fore us I feel happy that at 
the end of the long struggle 
we can face our people stand- 
ing on the same platform, 
our pledge fulfilled, our mu- 
tual friendship and regard 
enhanced, and, still enjoying. 
I hope, their continued con- 
fidence and support. 

With the approval of the 
Independence Act and its 
acceptance by the country we 
believed that our extended 
public service could at last 
come to an end. We would 
have been content as private 
citizens to lend our unstinted 
support to the new govern- 
ment. But it seems that our 
fellow-citizens have once ag- 
ain chosen to place upon our 
shoulders the new responsibi- 
lity of organizing the Com- 
monwealth and leading the 
nation during the early years 
of its existence. The nomina- 
tion that has been proffered 
to us attains the category of a 
call to duty which no public- 
spirited citizen may evade or 
disregard. I, therefore, Mr. 
Chairman, make public an- 
nouncement that I accept the 
49 



nomination for the Presi- 
dency which has been tend- 
ered to me, deeming it my 
bounden duty to do so, and I 
accept it with the most pro- 
found sense of the resspon- 
sibility that it entails and 
the deepest f eeUng of grati- 
tude. 

Having been nominated un- 
der the circumstances I have 
mentioned, I can not afford 
to speak in uncertain terms. 
The need of the hour is for 
fixed orientation, clear state- 
ment of policies, and a defi- 
nition of the national purpos- 
es. In the course of the pres- 
ent campaign I shall have 
opportunity to discuss all the 
important questions before 
the country. For the present 
I have to limit myself to a 
few of them. 

The Platform 
The Coalition platform 
meets with my whole-hearted 
approval. I took part in the 
drafting of that document 
and I make my own every 
commitment contained there- 
in. 

The Constitution 
I look upon the Constitu- 
tion of the Philippines as 
the expression of the sover- 
eignty and of the aggregate 
will of the Filipino People. 
I shall abide by its provis- 



ions. I shall uphold the demo- 
cratic principle underlying 
the institutions that it esta- 
blishes. I am opposed to a 
dictatorship. I maintain that 
no man who believes in a dic- 
tatorship can with safety be 
entrusted with the reins of 
executive power under the 
Constitution. Democracy can 
only survive if those at the 
helm of the government be- 
lieve in the people's right to 
rule and have faith in their 
inherent capacity to decide 
rightly important public 
questions. 

I will hold inviolate and 
will defend to the utmost the 
individual rights and liber- 
ties. I shall safeguard free 
speech, the freedom of the^ 
press, and the equality of ev- 
ry man before the law how- 
ever poor or ignorant. I 
shall insure for every citizen 
of the Philippines, from Lu- 
zon to Mindanao and Sulu, 
the right to worship God as 
his own conscience dictates. 

The Government of 

the Commonwealth 

We are entering a new era. 
We are on the threshold of 
free nationhood. The govern- 
ment of the Commonwealth 
that we shall establish deri- 
ves its powers from a cons- 
titution approved by the peo- 
ple themselves. It may tru- 



60 



ly be said that it is a gov- 
ernment of our creation to 
be administered for our own 
welfare. 

Except in a few specified 
cases, it will be free from 
American control in the con- 
duct of domestic affairs. 
Only in our foreign relations 
do we remain subject to Ame- 
rican supervision, and this 
because of the continuing res- 
ponsibility of the U.S. to pro- 
tect and defend the Islands 
from foreign aggression dur- 
ing the life of the Common- 
wealth. Hence, the govern- 
ment of the Commonwealth 
will be, in fact if not in name, 
an independent government 
under the protection of the . 
United States. 

The immediate task before 
us is to set up the new gov- 
ernment, — a task that will 
require all the foresight, the 
wisdom, and the courage of 
our people. Then we must 
adopt such measures as will 
insure the stability of our 
national economy, and pro- 
vide for the honest and effi- 
cient administration of the 
affairs of the government. 
Equally important is to make 
adequate provision for the 
defense of our country ag- 
ainst external aggression or 
internal disorders. 

51 



I favor a simple and eco- 
nomical government, one in 
keeping with the limited re- 
sources of our coimtry but 
which is capable of minis- 
tering to the needs of the 
nation. 

I shall be unsparing in my 
efforts to carrj' out the man- 
date of the constitution re- 
garding the civil service. 
Merit and character alone 
will be the qualificfition for 
office or promotion. For 
the highest responsible posts 
I shall call on the most ca- 
pable, honest and patriotic 
citizens, regardless of politi- 
cal affiliation or religious be- 
lief. This is no time for pla- 
cing party considerations 
above the commonwealth. In 
fact, one of the main purpo- 
ses of the coalition is to se- 
cure the cooperation and help 
of the best available men to 
insure the success of the 
Commonwealth. I shall tole-" 
rate neither corruption nor 
inefficiency in public office 

Financial Policy 
Thf, . financial stability of 
the government depends up- 
on our ability to keep expen- 
ses within our income. At 
the time w^hen other goveni- 
ments are resorting to loans 
in order to meet their obli- 
gations we can take pride in 
the fact that we have been 



able to maintain a balanced 
budget. Under our constitu- 
tion the responsibility for 
maintaining a balanced bud- 
get falls mainly upon the ex- 
ecutive. I pledge myself to 
maintain the credit of the 
government and at all times 
to balance the budget and 
keep our finances in a sound 
condition. 

I shall keep our present 
currency system in all its in- 
tegrity and will allow no 
change that will affect its va- 
lue . If new conditions should 
require such a change it will 
be done only after the most 
careful study and consulta- 
tion with competent experts. 
For the present I can see no 
reason for any radical modi- 
fication in our monetary 
system . 

Taxation 
Irresponsible demagogues 
* have tried to arouse in the 
hearts of our people the hope 
that under an independent 
Philippines there shall be no 
taxes except upon the rich. 
It is my duty to warn the cre- 
dulous against such misrep- 
resentation . Governments 
can be supported only throu- 
gh taxation. It is a primaiy 
duty of citizens to contribute 
to the support of the govern- 
ment, but taxation that does 
not rake into consideration the 



relative financial ability of 
the taxpayer is unjust. I fa- 
vor a complete revision of 
our system of taxation with 
the best technical advice av- 
ailable. I advocate that the 
burdens of the stat^ be equi- 
tably distributed in propor- 
tion to the means and possi- 
bilities of the taxpayer. We 
shall make a general reduc- 
tion of the assessed value of 
real property in accordance 
with present prices. 

Public Wo7^ks 

The so-called pork barrel 
system, as known in the 
United States and as some- 
times practiced in the Phil- 
ipppines, must definitely be 
discarded. It is a waste of 
public funds. I am in favor 
of continuing the building of 
roads and schools, in accord- 
ance with a carefully prepar- 
ed plan to be followed sys- 
tematically, in the order of 
their relative importance to 
the general public. « 
Public Instruction ^ 
I stand by the educational 
policy enunciated m the 
Constitution. The principle 
underlying this policy is the 
training for useful, well- 
disciplined, self-sacrificing 
citizenship that draws its 
breath of life from Filipino 
patriotism. Our system of 

education should be revised 

52 



so as to accomplish that aim 
still more effectively. The 
State is in duty bound to 
maintain a complete and ade- 
quate system of public edu- 
cation, providing at leasi.' 
free public primary instruct- 
lion and citizensliip training 
to adult citizens. 

My attention will be espe- 
cially devoted' to maldng it 
possible for every child to go 
to school. Adult citizenship 
training will be carried out 
in accordance with a broad 
and systematic plan. To the 
end that poverty may not 
prevent^ gifted young men 
and women from developing 
their talent, the government 
should create the largest 
possible number ofi scholar- 
ship for them in all branch- 
es of learning. Our educa- 
tional objective should fit in 
witli our economic policy I 
am for greater emphasis' on 
vocational and agricultural 
training in the intermediate 
and high schools, hnt the 
instruction should always be 
in keeping v/ith the econo- 
mic conditions of each re 
gion and of the countrv a^ 
a whole. ^

alike is the strongest bul- 
wark of individual rights 
and the best guaranty ag- 
ainst oppression and usur- 
pation from any source. 
Equally unportant is the 
maintenance of the confi- 
dence of the people in the 
courts. I vvall appoint no man 
to the bench without having 
satisfied myself, after a tho~ 
rough investigation, of his 
character ^nd ability. 

To strengahen the faith of 
the common people in our 
courts, it is necessary that 
the utmost care be exerted 
in the selection of Justices 
of the Peace. These courts 
are often the only tribunals 
accessible to the larger por- 
tion of oiir population and it 
is essential that they be 
maintained worthv of their 
confidence. If the disinhe- 
rited can not obtain redress 
of their grievances or vindi- 
cation of their rights in 
these courts,^ they have no 
further recourse, for the 
Courts of First Instance and 
the Supreme Court are often 
beyond their reach. By the 
impartialitV and integrity of 
the Justices of the Peace. 

the judiciary of 
-Philippines is judged by 
the milhons of our countrv- 
who live in tlie bamos 
and distant places. I pledge 



myself to do evierything in 
my power to maintain these 
courts free from political or 
other extraneous influence 
and to appoint thereto only- 
men of proven ability and 
integrity and of the broad- 
est human symphaties. 
Social Problems 
The welfare of the people 
should be the concern of the 
government. The helpless 
and the needy, the jobless, as 
well as the workers in the 
factories and in the field 
have a claim upon the gov- 
ernment to safeguard their 
health and v/ell-being. The 
contentment of the masses 
is the first insurance against 
social and political disorders 
It is tlie duty of the govern- 
ment to protect tlie working- 
men against abuses and ex- 
ploitation, to secure to them 
fair wages and reasonable 
return for their labor. 

Let us beware of men who 
deliberately, for political 
or selfish aims, stir up dis- 
content among the masses. 
They preach subversive doc- 
trines, speak of evils and 
abuses that do not exist:, or 
magnify those which often 
are inevitable in democra- 
cies. These men are ^ the 
worse enemies of society, 
more dangerous to the com- 
munity than ordinaiy cri- 
minals. They have no sym- 



pathy for the people, but are 
mere self-seekers, intent on- 
ly in securing either pecu- 
niary or political advantage 
for themselves. If as a re- 
sult of their preachings dis- 
orders occur, they coward- 
ly disclaim all responsibility 
for that which none other 
than themselves had brought 
about. He who tries to curry 
favor with the masses by ap- 
pealing to the passions of tlie 
people, stirring up their pre- 
judices, or capitalizing dis- 
content or human suffering, 
is unworthy of public trust. 



Landed Estates 
Thp ownership of big land- 
ed esliates by coiTorations or 
absentee landloi^ls have in- 
variably caused discontent 
and unrest among the ten- 
ants or occupants of such 
estates . The ^'^' f^^^^ 
among the tenants of the 
Friar lands contributed to 
L causes which led to th3 
rebellion against bpam. 
Those Friar lands have been 
acquired by the g<>vern^^^^^^ 
and sold in small lots but 
there are still a, few laige 
haciendas particularly m l.u- 
zon that are the hotbeds of 
discontent and unrest among 
their tenants. Not only foi 
the sake of these tenants 
but also in the ^ll^^^t^^^^^ 
peace, every effort should 



be made to acquire these ha- 
ciendas, at a f^ir just 
price to be sold in small lots 
to the tenants. 

Thei-e are complaints in 
certain places that the ten- 
ants are the victims of unfair* 
practices on the part of their 
landlords. These abuses must 
be stopped and the tenant 
protected in his rights. 

Labor 

Fortunately for our coim- 
try, we have had no sharp 
cleavages between labor and 
capital. Strikes have been 
few and far-between, and 
they have never been long- 
drawn out Or general. That 
-we have so far been spared 
the extremeties of class war- 
fare, is no proof that we 
shall forever be exempt. 
Our good fortune should ra- 
ther teach us to seek the 
ixieans to preserve the coun- 
try against such conflicts 
by the only method which 
experience has shown to be 
effective, namely, by taking 
steps designed to prevent the 
exploitation and oppression 
of the working-men and thus 
assure their happiness and 
contentment. 

Filipino laborers, compared 
to those of Oriental countries 
i-eceive higher wages and are 
much better protected in 
their rights by legislation. 



We have enacted many laws 
protecting labor. In all earn- 
estness, however, I must say 
that we must' go further in 
tliis direction. The exper- 
ience of centuries shows 
that the one sure way to 
protect society against class 
war is to secure to wage-earn- 
ers their due. 

I am against communism. 
I am a firm believer in. the 
institution of private pro- 
perty. I contend, however, 
that whenever property 
rights come in canflict with 
human rights, the former 
should yield to .the latter. 

If we would preserve the 
institution of private pro- 
perty, we must hold fast to 
this principle, in the deter- 
mination of conflicting 
rights between man and man. 
It is thus that we may draw 
the line between the rights 
of labor and capital and 
erect' an (economic structure 
based on the principle that 
human life is the measure of 
all other values that consi- 
derations of possession and 
profit must give way to the 
supremacy of human exis- 
tence. 

Capital 
A change in the political 
status of a counti-y always 
gives rise to fear and mis- 
givings. Not only among 



Americans and foreigners, 
but even among a f^w Fili- 
pinos, the impending politi- 
cal changes have caused an- 
xiety as to tTie future. 

There is no justification 
for these fears. I give as- 
surance that peace, order, 
law and justice will reign su- 
preme under the Common- 
wealth, and that the rights 
of foreigners and nationals 
alike will be safeguarded. 
Existing investments, whe- 
xh^Y foreign or national, will 
receive eveiy inducement to 
stay, and outside capital will 
be welcomed. We especially 
desire that new American 
capital should come and help 
in the development of rii^ 
country. 

National Defeiise 
I believe in the efficacy of 
' the instrumentalities o f 
peace, such as the League of 
Nations or treaties of neu- 
trality. In due time we 
should apply for admission 
to the Lea,gue and urge the 
negotiation of a multilateral 
treaty for the Ineutraliatiom 
of the Philippines. However, 
we cannot ignore present-day 
treaty for the neutralization 
exclusively on these imple- 
ments of peace for our na- 
tional defense. 

I favor preparedness for 
national defense. We can not 



afford to have, nor do I ap- 
prove of, a large standing 
army or costly military esta- 
blishment, but we must Imve a 
regular army of sufficient size 
for our requirements and a 
trained citizenry ready to be 
drafted into servidei in any 
emergency. For the proper 
planning of our defenses and 
the organization and train- 
ing of our regular and citi- 
zen army I shall securp the 
best expert advice. 
Our Relations With America 
It should be our constant 
endeavor to niaintain the 
most friendly relations and 
closest collaboration ^^^l^^Yrh 
United States. We owe mucn 
to America and wte aie 
grateful to her. Our present 
economy is tied up with the 
free American market. Many 
of our industries depend tor 
their existence on our reci 
procal free trade relations 
with the United States, a.nd 
we should try to maintain 
thesp trade relations it pos- 
sible, even after mdepen- 
denda I shall spar^ no ei- 
fort to obtain th^ elimination 
of the export tax provided 
in the Independence Law. i 
shall work for the repeal ot 
th excise tax on coconut oil. 
I shall endeavor to take such 
action as may be required to 
place our trade relation with 

56 



the United States on a truly 
reciprocal basis, so that they 
may be continued after in- 
dependence for the mutual 
advantagje of both countries. 

Foreign HeUitionis 
As already stated, our for^ 
eign relations will be under 
the control and supervision 
of tliie United States during- 
the Commonwealth; but 
there is nothing in the Inde- 
pendence Act which prevents 
the Commonwealth from be" 
^nning to lay the founda- 
tions for our future relations 
-virith foreign nations. Indeed, 
the period of transition hav- 
ing been provided to give to 
the Filipino people time to 
piiepare themselves for the 
responsibilities of an inde- 
pendent government, it can 
t>e rightly assumed that the 
United Slates meant to give 
us the opportunity, under the 
Commonwealth, of initiating 
both political as well as trade 
relations with other coun- 
tries, subject to its supervi- 
sion and control. 

We shall request the State 
Department at Washington 
to permit the Commonwealth 
to send men as attaches to 
American legations or emba- 
ssies as well as to American 
consulates in order that these 
men may acquire the know- 
ledge and experience in the 



diplomatic service and pio 
vide our government with 
lieded infoi-mation concern- 
ing foreign trade. 

It will be necessaiy and to 
our advantage besides to wm 
the good-wiU of, and mam- 
tain friendly relations with, 
other nations.. But to accom- 
plish this aim, mere protesta. 
tions of good purposes are 
not enough. We niust deal 
fairly with all nations and 
respect their rights. We 
must secure to eveiy foreig- 
ner who lives with as full 
protection of our laws. His 
life, his property, must be as 
safe among us as thiey are in 

his own land. 

During the transition pe- 
riod we shall endeavor to 
find new markets for our 
products so that if and when 
the market of the United 
States shall no longer be 
open to us, except on a com- 
petitive basis. We may not be 
left without outlet for our 
products. 

Philippine Independence 
The question of Philippine 
Independence has been set- 
tled. The Independence Law 
sets the day for Indepen- 
dence and prescribes the pro- 
cess leading to its consum- 
mation. We accepted the In, 
dependence Law, we have 
approved a Constitution pur- 



57 



suant to its provisions, and 
the people by ratifying it 
^vith practical unanimity 
have agreed to the grant of 
independence under the 
terms and conditions pres- 
cribed by the Congress. In- 
dependence, therefore, is no 
longer an issue either in the 
United States or in the Phi- 
lippines. Insofar as the terms 
and conditions of indepen- 
dence are concerned, we 
made it plain when we ac- 
cepted the Independence Law 
that we reserved the right to 
petition Congress for ^ their 
modification with a view to 
making them less burden- 
some for our people and 
more adapted to the attain- 
ment of the purpose for 
which Congress intended 
them. 

We consider tlie economic 
provisions of the Indepen- 
dence Law not entirely fair 
to the Philippines. We re- 
gard legislation recently 
passed by Congress imposing 
greater restrictions on our 
free imports to the United 
States Or authorizing the col- 
lection of exhorbifcant taxes 
on some of our products sold 
in that country, not only dis- 
criminatory, but a virtual 
violation of the solemn cove- 
nant between the two count- 
ries. We shall exert effort 



to secure the repeal of those 
discriminatoiy measures and 
to obtain amendments to the 
Independence Law looking to 
a more equitable trade ar- 
rangement between the Uni- 
ted States and the Philip- 
pines during the Common- 
wealth. 

In relation to the transition 
period, the Congmss of the 
United States fixed the term 
of ten years considering it 
.necessaiy to allow the Phi- 
lippines gradually to adjust 
their national economy to the 
conditions which will obtain 
when independence should 
Eventuate and to permit the 
Filipinos to prepare them- 
selves adequately for the res- 
pon-^^ibilities of independent 
nationhood. It was, there- 
fore, chieflv, for the benefit 
of the Philippines rather 
than of the United States 
that the intermediate period 
of ten years was fixed. While 
there may be differences ot 
opinion as to whether tins 
period is too long or too 
short all must agree that, it 
our trade relations with the 
United States during the 
Commonw^G^alth should prove 
more injurious to our coun- 
try than they would under 
complete independence, the 
Philippines w^ould then do 
wiell to hasten the date of se- 



paration from America. This 
fact w^ill '^^^ revealed to 
us until after the first years 
of the Commonwealth and 
£re have known the result of 
fhe economic conference bet- 
^xreen representatives of the 
irjiited States and the Phi- 
lippines which, I trusts, will 
called by the President of 
the United States at an early 
Ante. Meanwhile, I consider 
a niost disturbing influ- 
ence which will retard our 
^rork of economic readjust- 
nient and reconstruction, for 
^j^yone to advocate now the 
gliortening of the transition 
period. \Vliat the country 
direly needs today is a pe- 
jod of stability and business 
^onficlence so that we may 
proceed unhampered in the 
task of erecting our new go- 
vernment and building up 
tiie national economy to in- 
crease the wealth of the na- 
tion, promote conmierce, ag- 
x-iculture, and industry; ira, 
prove the condition 'of our 
wage-earners, and create eco- 
nomic opportunities for all 
our citizens. We need to give 
capital reasonable certainty 
xis to those conditions which 
affect investment; We need 
to assure the industries that 
are dependent upon the free 
American market that no ra- 
dical changes will talce place 



which will bring about a 
sudden loss of the market on 
which they depend; we needi 
above all to provide econo- 
mic security jtor the masses 
of our people which can only 
be accomplished through the 
maintenance of stable busi- 
^less conditions. 

I yield to no one in my fer- 
vent desire to see the Phil- 
ippines independent as soon 
as possible, but I cannot 
close my eyes to the fact that' 
a difference of a few years 
Jnay mean a great deal to 
the well-being of our people 
and the permanence of our 
national liberty. Besides, we 
should not be deluded into 
believing that it is possible 
for anyone at this time to 
obtain from Congi-ess the 
shortening of the transition 
period. All the pleas that 
may now be submitted in. 
support of this action had 
already been considered and 
passed upon by that body. 
No new reason can be ad- 
vanced that had not been al- 
ready submitted. Therefore, 
making an issue of the short- 
ening of the transition per- 
iod is unfair to our people 
and most injurious to their 
interests. 

I am anxious fo see our 
independence established at 



59 



the earliest possible date. I 
look upon it as the most 
pnacious reward for the ma- 
ny years of ceaseless efforts 
that I have spent in its quest. 
I pledge myself anew neso- 
lutely to take all the neces- 
saiT steps leading to the ad- 
veoit of independence, and to 



do everything in my power 
to make the Philippine Re- 
public strong and enduring, 
'.and the blessings of liberty 
not only the cherished pos- 
session of this generation 
but the priceless heritage ot 
the Filipino people for all 
timje.
