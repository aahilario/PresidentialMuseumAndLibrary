CITIES AND POPULATION 

Honolulu, the capital and principal city, is 
situated on the island of Oahu, 2020 miles from 
San Francisco. It lias a population of about 75,- 
000. All important trans-Pacific steamer lines 
meet at Honolulu, and most of the large houses 
doing business in the Islands have head- 
quarters in that city. It is also the tourist 
mecca of the Pacific.

FLOWERS AND TREES 
Ferns, creepers, vines, plants and trees 
crow in tropical profusion in Hawaii, uroyes 
of kukui trees {aleuritis moluccana) , with their 
light yellow-green leaves, adorn the mountain 
sides The kernel of the nut of this tree was 
used to furnish the oil for the crude lamps of he 
lancient Hawaiians. The manufacture of kukui 
I oil is one of Hawaii's promising infant industries. 
!The koa tree (Hawaiian mahogany) furnishes 
a hardwood extensively used for furniture. 
Ohia wood is used for furniture, flooring, paving, 
'railroad ties and posts. Banana, lehua, lauhala 
'and palms furnish materials for mats. The 
jmonkeypod and banyan are splendid trees much 
Ijin evidence. The mango, with its delicious 
*fruit. thrives on all the larger islands. Then 
.there are the breadfruit, orange, eucalyptus, 
mulberry, and kiawe or algaroba. The latter 
was introduced in 1 837 by Father Bachelot, and 
, the first of its kind may still be seen in the 
grounds of the Catholic Mission on Fort street, 
Honolulu. I 
HAWAIIAN RACE 

The Hawaiians are a stalwart race. They are 
generous, pleasure-loving, natural musicians 
and orators, usually well educated, as compul- 
I sory education has been in vogue for nearly 50 
: years. They never were cannibals. They 
r welcomed the earliest visitors gladly, and 
speedily embraced religion, when brought to 
them by American missionaries from New 
England in 1820, The Hawaiians were never 
' savages. They have straight hair; and, although 
the Caucasian race dominates, native blood is 
[found in the highest social and business circles 
[of the Islands. 




UKULELES 

The manufacture of ukuleles, the little Ha- 
waiian musical instruments which have become 
the rage all over the mainland, has become a 
leading industry, and the factories are turning out 
thousands every year. Every Hawaiian made 
-ukulele carries a "made-in-Hawaii" label Ha- 
waiian music is everywhere the rage

VOLCANOES 

Kilauea, the world's greatest living volcano, 
is on the Island of Hawaii about 225 miles south 
Mid east of Honolulu. 

A road, seven miles in length, 
i ompleted a few years ago goes from the hotels 

■ tually upon the floor of the main crater of the 
uu at volcano, over which it is possible to drive 
in v\ ithin a few hundred feet of the living fire-pit. 

I his road winds through marvelously fascinating 
scenery, descending some six hundred feel be- 
lore finally reaching the old lava floor of the 
^ real crater. 

For the past several years the Volcano of 
Kilauea has been more active than usual and 
has been visited by many thousands of tourists. 
At times it has been exceedingly spectac ular ii 
,is display of natural pyrotechnics, though even 
m its periods of comparative quiet, this volcano 
ma} truly be considered one

Bananas and rice culture are largely in the 
hands of Orientals. Most of the rice grown is 
consumed locally. The banana industry is of 
much importance, and the shipping facilitcs are 
such that the market on the coast is regularly 
supplied. The sisal fiber business is important, 
and the product is of exceptionally high grade. 

Pobacco raising is in its infancy, and its suc- 
cess is slowly being demonstrated. 'I here 
several companies engaged in the business, 
3 quantity of high-grade wrapper leaf has been 
produced in the past few years. 

Practically all known tropical and semi- 
tropical fruits are produced, though aside from 
pineapples and bananas few are of much com-

SURF RIDING 

A daring and distinctively Hawaiian aquatic 
sport is surf riding. It is most fascinating to 
watch the men and boys standing erect on their 
surfboards dashing shoreward, topping the crest 
of the highest waves. Much practice and great 
skill is required to excel in this sport. A mnn- 
her of ladies and children ha ve- become profiaenl 
and tourists pick up the art in a ifor night A 
sport which is enjoyed by all is riding he > jug

A MID -PACIFIC EDEN 

The Hawaiian Islands have never harbored 
a snake of any kind nor a reptile or insect more 
dangen us than a bee or wasp. There is no 
other semi-tropical land in the world where one 
may roam from sea beach to mountain top, on 
plain or in deepest jungle, with absolutely 
t nothing to fear trom any animate creature, 
ij Moreover, there are no common poisonous 
plants, such as poison ivy or poison oak in any 
M part of the Territory. These beautiful islands 
J are indeed favored above all other spots on 
B Earth as an,all-the-year-round playground. 
: When summer heat is suffocating on the 
i mainland, Hawaii enjoys soft breezes; ?n winter 
: when the mainland is in the freezing grip of 
King Frost, Hawaii is warm and balmy. Hawaii 
is reached by steamer from the Pacific Coast 
over the " Smooth Water Route," as Wm. 11 
1 Crane, the eminent actor declared the voyage 
over the Sun Kissed Seas in July and August 

HOSPITALITY AND DAILY LIFE 

Hawaiian hospitality is famous the world 
I over - Visitors from every walk in life have 
proclaimed its open-handed lavishness Per- 
haps the greatest factor in establishing its iustlv 
jfavprabc reputation is the Hawaiian luau or 
, native feast. Mats, ferns and ti-leaves upon 
| the floor or ground are sometimes a substitute 
| f ° r tab1 ^ <™d chairs, while fingers are used in 
place of table silver. Meats and fish are pre- 
pared in a manner that add much to the /est of 
lie diner. Poi.thc national staple dish, of course 
takes a prominent part in the feast. It was 
formerly served in large and beautifully polished 
wooden calabashes. Many of the dishes set 
before the guest will well repay investigation 
1 he hula dance which in former times character- 
lzed many Hawaiian feasts is gradually being 
l eliminated. In its original form, the dance 
a d real religious significance.

WhWwe visited Russia in 1919 it was tne custom, and I understand it 
st.ll is, for men and women to go in bathing together at the public 
beaches, naked. They do not stare at each other, for to do so is con- 
sidered impolite. They disrobe in bath houses, or if they are not 
handy they undress down to the last stitch publicly on the beach, 
nlace their clothes in a neat pile, and run into the water. The nude 
figures lying summing themselves on tea left in the above picture 
are girls and women. We got our first sight of naked women when as 
our ship was entering the harbor at Vladivostok three young women 
all naked, swam out to meet us. The nassen.-ers were amazed, but the 
three girls got a great kick out of it, waving their hands at us 
and laughing hilariously.

Reverence for the Japanese Mother 



^,HERE is but one way to really know and ap- D MRS. ELIZABETH A 7 JJ ()()]) 
T^freriate the Japanese mother, and that is to be *V iUilu ' 
I f m est in her home. And before visiting such 
. L it is well to know something about it. some- 
fhinfabout the dwelling itself and the family. 

The home I have in mind was neither that of a 
very rieh or very poor family, butof the well-to-do 
middle class, 



C i y l/v/v/j j j — 

There were the father, mother, four 
Sen and three maids, together with a general handy 
w ho supplied the "motive power in his master s 
r rk-shaw and also worked in the garden. Everyone 
has a garden in Japan, even if they have no more than 
a striate yard of soil. Four servants would indicate 
considerable riches in this country, especially in these 
days but not so in Japan. The wealthy Japanese have 
thirty or more servants. And people whom we would 
regard as rather poor in this country generally manage 
to have one servant, f ... 

The father in this family held a good position in a 
ar g e commercial importing house and spoke English 
• ery well indeed, as did his charming wife. The older 

- n was in what is called the "middle school" preparing 
t - college, the younger son in primary school, and the 
i\\ W as & taught privately at home. The fourth child 

too vounjr for school. # 4 — 

^ nils vlsrtdUttg v>> a. charming i.xx?»ir ul n f OO<I 3iYtfi 
a- boo. It is a two-story house, in- 
e- ^ with a high bamboo fence ; on 
fit side stretches a dainty little garden 
•k itified by a tiny pond in which are 
i- kling goldfish; dwarfed pine, maple, 
il, a few flowers grow here in season, 
the entrance to the home is made 
r e uresque by a rather imposing heavy 
~ )den gate on top of which is a 
'f ring roof of tile. » 

- Within the house : there are eight 
»ms, besides the servants' quarters 

- ich are away at the rear, quite by 
e mselves, and the kitchen and bath. 

- st why these two latter rooms are nev- 
i taken into account when reckoning the 

parity of a Japanese house I do not 
5 low, but such is the case. Six of the 
1 >oms are on the ground floor and two 
re in the second story which is reached 
y a ladder-like pair of stairs beset 
vith perils for foreign feet, though the 
Japanese do not seem to mind climbing 
them in the least. Rooms in Japan are 
measured by the number of mats they 
contain and the standard size of a mat 
is six feet by three. We will say that 
this house contains,' upstairs, one room 
of eight mats and one of six, while 
downstairs we find two eight mat rooms, 
one of six and one of three. 

One of the most interesting spots in 
a Japanese house is the kitchen. Un- 
like the other rooms, its floor is not 
covered with mats, but is partly wooden 
and partly earthen or stone. The boards 
in the wooden floor permit of being lift- 
ed up so that the space between them 
and the ground underneath can be used 



or ten minutes at a time. While the male portion of 
the family are sunning themselves outside, mother is 
busy directing and helping the maids to gather up the 
mattresses and quilts and stow them away in the 
closets, to fly the feather dusters and get the rooms in 
order for breakfast. As soon as this task has been fin- 
ished tea is set out and a small dish containing the 
morning relish, very likely tiny plums pickled in salt 
brine. "Father comfortably scats himself and enjoys 
his tea and morning paper, while mother bustles around 
seeing that the older children have their breakfast and 
get off to school, which everywhere in Japan begins by 
eight o'clock, if not earlier. Very likely the older boy 
and girl may have half or three-quarters of an hour 
trip to school so they have to be off in good season. 
Daughter must have her hair plaited and a ribbon on 
top, according to present schoolgirl style which, 1 would 
have you know, is as much regarded in Japan as in 
America. Over her kimono she wears a pleated skirt 
which is fastened with a narrow girdle or sash about 
her waist. This pleated skirt has come into fashion 
aloni.' with gymnastfes and other modern branches of

earthen firebox over which the cooking 
is done and shelves laden with rice tubs, 
casks of soy, various jars and pots and 
kettles, nails from which hang sieves, 
wooden ladles and long-handled bam- 
boo cups and dippers, comprise the ap- 
pointments of the kitchen. Passing 
through the kitchen, we come to the 
bathroom, which to the Japanese way of 
thinking is the most essential room in 
the house. The bath tub is made of 
wood in oval or oblong shape, so deep 
that when the bather sits down in it, 
his head is just level with the top. At 
one end of the tub is an iron pipe into 
which charcoal is placed for heating 
the water. In front of the pipe is nailed 
a board, so that the bather may not 
burn himself by coming in contact with 
the hot iron. The floor is built sloping 
so that the water splashed about will 
run into a trough and out to the sewer 
through a drainage pipe. But the queer 
thing about the Japanese bath is that 
you must do your bathing before you 
get into it. Each one gives himself a

lamps are taken into the kitchen, cleaned and tilled 
with oil and the rooms are all thoroughly -one over so 
that not a speck of dust is to he seen anywhere Now 
the tradespeople begin to arrive and the mother steps 
out to the kitchen door and looks over the vegetables 
which are brought tor her inspection, making a 
lection tor the needs of the day. One after the 
other the venders of different goods put in their ap- 
pearance—the fish man. the bean-curd seller, the fruit 
dealer, the faggot and charcoal man and the boys with 
rice and soy. Sometimes the mistress of the house pays 
for her purchases as she makes them, but more often 
they are put on a hill which is sent in the last day of 
the month for payment. 

EYKRY day is wash day in a Japanese house and this 
task falls to the lot of the maids, the mistress onlv 
needing to have a care that the work is done properly, 
A Japanese kimono has to be taken apart every time 
it is washed so that the outer part and the linings may 
be done separately. The pieces are well scrubbed and 
then starched and spread out to dry on a smooth hoard 
which is placed against the side "of the house where 
the sun will strike it. This method of 
drying requires no ironing, tor the doth 
when removed from the boards is en- 
tirely free from wrinkles. 

The hour from eleven to twelve is 
generally a Japanese mother's leisure 
time and she improves the moments by 
looking through the papers so that she 
may he sufficiently well informed to 
converse on matters of interest with her 
husband and her children, or perhaps 
she reads a chapter in a novel or an 
article in one of the several magazines 
lor women which are a product of the 
last quarter century. After she has 
finished her noonday meal, which, since 
she partakes of it alone, is a very 
simple one and eaten in short order, 
the mother turns her attention to needle- 
work, Y»>u can very easily imagine 
that with all her own and her children's 
clothes to make, to say nothing of a 
large share of her husband's, the Jap- 
anese mother always has plenty of sew- 
ing on hand. She d«>es not, of course, 
d«» it all herself, but calls in her servants 
to help her. They come into the sitting 
room and squat on the iloor near her 
so that she can direct and supervise 
their work. W hen a dress is once made, 
the work is n«»t over and done with as 
it is with us, for Japanese clothes re- 
quire constant unmaking and remaking. 
Then, too, the Japanese mother must 
make and keep in order all the bedding, 
mattresses, covers, and >o forth, and 
also the Cushions, a large supply of 
which must always be kept on hand. 
So if every day is wash day in a Jap- 

:jii#'w hnt!</» it inay b# Ul/fj *v»th rilliaJ, 

truth that every day is sewing day, for 
the work would pile up insurmountably, 
were the mistress of the house constant- 
ly bent upon diminishing it. 

But the whole afternoon cannot be 
devoted to sewing, for various interrup- 
tions are bound to occur. Perhaps the 
mother must go out for shopping, or 
friends and relatives may drop in for 
an afternoon chat, or more likely still 
the hairdresser will put in her appear-

Japanese woman to comb her own hair, 
that is, if she follows the old-fashioned 
style of hair dressing which requires the 
application of oil and a rather compli- 
cated arrangement of hair, combs and 
ornaments at the back of the head. 
When this arrangement has once been 
effected, it will last for several days, 
perhaps a week, without requiring to 
be done over. The hairdresser in the 
Japanese home fills the place of the 
village seamstress in the American 
home. She is the general dispenser of 
information and gossip, so you can see

it permits a far more active use of the limbs than is 
possible to the wearer of a kimono. 

After the boys and girls have finished their break-

rice apiece, a bit of fish and pickled vegetables and 
plenty of cups of tea, they hurry off to school, mother 
seeing to it that their lunches are ready for them and 
that none of their schoolbooks are forgotten. Gen-

lippiin Mission in T^ashington and is 
jono or the strongest advocates of 
I Filipino independence in (lie United

j Mr. Tavenner is a newspaper man 
lot long experience and has been, 
fsyndiciUinz a weekly Washington 
,'fetter to 100 daily papers and ~,G00 
j weekly papers. 1L. was engaged by 
Innate President Quezon to spread 
the gospel of Philippine independence 
among the press of the United Sta-

Rowland Thomas, author of 'fiction 
and member of >.he Sunday staff of 
the New York World, who has just

Save so long elsewhere disturbed the peace

in the balance and have proved their fit- 
ncss to govern themselves. Of this Mr. 
Kalaw furnishes convinang prooi 

It is very instructive to see how the 
Filipinos have worked out a successful 
bXt system, which this country has 
vainl v been striving for, under which the 



budget is prepared by men elected by the 

Pe ? ( ple ', s nredictcd that if the Philippines 
independent "the Mores would re- 
W - thei Piratical life and war on their 
Christ an brothers, and that the other dis- 
Sic s would be subject to disorders and 
ta *S The Philippine officials have 
SSS all these gloomy prophecies, and 
Save adopted a policy of kindness winch 
is steldUv civilizing all these so-called 
«savS tribes » and has accomplished 
wonderful results. Civil government wa 
Mtihlished under an American, Governor 
Cmpenter, and has been continued so 
wiselv that peace and order reign, and tnc 
Moros have learned to trust and respec 
the other islanders to such a degree that 
their representative in the Filipino Sen- 
ate said, "We are one in spirit and one in 
blood." 

The Filipinos have nearly doubled the 
mileage of first-class road from the end ol 
1Q14 to 10 IS They have built public budd- 
ings school-houses, and bridges, increasing 
the amount devoted to public works trom 
about 3,000,000 pesos annually under Gov- 
ernor Forbes to 17,000,000 in 1910. They 
have a Bureau of Labor to serve as a 
mediator in disputes between labor and 
capital of which both the Director and 
Assistant Director are labor leader. The 
number of children at school <n 1912 was 
440 000, in 1018, 675,000 The numbe. 
of teachers in the Department of Min- 
danao and Sulu in 1912 was 99, m 1018, 
783. . . 

One is tempted to quote more freely | 
from the abundant evidence which this 
volume contains that tbe Filipinos are a 
united, civilized, prosperous people, en- 
tirely fit to govern themselves. It is enough 
to r'epeat the words of Governor Harri- 
son- "The Filipino people have come out 
triumphantly through their trial. By tem- 
perament, bv experience, by financial abil- 
ity in everv way, the ten millions of 
Filipinos are entitled to be free from 
every government except of their own 
1 choice * * * They are intelligent 
enough to decide for themselves * * * 
I have found the native Filipino official 
to be honest, efficient, and as capable of 
administering executive positions as any 
men I have met anywhere in the world. 

The Filipinos have done their part If 
the American Governor and Vice-Gov- 
ernor were to sail away tomorrow, the 



^stabUdied would go on without fedtag 
shock. The question which for twen- 
ty years has vexed the conscience ot the 
American people recur,. Shall we whose 
covernment stands upon the immortal dec 
faration that all human governments rei 
aoon the consent of the governed reins 
to such a people as this has shown Use, 
to be the same right of self-government? 

If we care nothing for the principle 
which we constantly profess, shall w 
treat our solemn promise to withdraw ou ^O^^/S^ 
-sovereignty over the Philippine Islands an 
to recognize their independence as soon 
as a stable government can be established 
therein" as a mere "scrap of paper, ' fol- 
lowing an example of broken faith which 
we all condemn? 

In a word shall we whose conquest ot 
the Philippine Islands is a chapter in our 
national historv of which no American 
can really be proud, add a yet blacker 
chapter to that historv by trampling prin- 
ciples and promises alike underfoot, and 
while trying to emancipate other nations 
for which we are not responsible, continue 
to hold in subjection the weaker people 



(or which we arc responsible 

If the American people really nolle ve 
in their own institutions and value their 
I own honor, there can be but one answer 
to these questions.

Much sooner than was supposed— because we spoke about him 
in this same column on the 11th instant— Mr. Clyde 11. Tatenner, 
the metropolitan ex-Congressman, will arrive in this city, if nol i"- 
night, s tomorrow morning, .and- he comes in a trip of study 
and observation, collecting datas that would help to sustain 
in. the metropolis our demand for the independence which, thru the 
Mission recently sent over, the Filipino People have formalized once 
more before the United States Congress and the most promim-in 
representations of that nation. Mr. Tavenner is Director of the Pu- 
blicity Bureau which the Philippine Mission, at its return to the 
country, established in Washington; therefore, it is needless to say 
that Mr. Tavenuer,is a good friend of the. Filipinos and a sympathizer 
that we be granted the independence. 

With these details ahead, it seems unnecessary to eonsign the 
<•onvciiien.ee that we should all join ourselves to furnish whatever in- 
formations there are which Mr. Tavenner may require. The Eacl 
that he is for our liberty does not release, us from the duty to aid 
him efficiently. On the contrary, precisely Because the country has 
in that gentleman a sincere friend, our obligation is consequently 
double. lie comes not only to set; and observe our failings, as tourists 
who arc none of our sympathizers ordinarily do; no. He came prin 
eipally to gather new materials that fortify our 0ause in the metro- 
polis, above all when our question would be definitely broftffht aboul 
before the America!) Congress, for its, final resolution. uiuiyioe. 
then, the capital importance which Mr. Tavenner's present visi, t, 
these Islands has for ,us. ^- ... ,

Geographical Location and Area of the Philippines 

The Philippine Archipelago lies north of the Dutch and British 
Island of Borneo and the Dutch Island of Celebes, south of the Japa- 
nese Island of Formosa, and east of French Indo-China, the British 
colony of Hongkong, and the southern provinces of the Republic 
of China. It runs from five degrees north latitude to twenty-two 
degrees north latitude, and is entirely in the tropics. Authorities 
have stated that an isosceles triangle, approximately 500 miles on 
its base and 1,000 miles on the sides, would enclose all except the 
Sulu group of coral islands. 

Within this figure there are 3,141 islands, in sizes from the tiny 
islet, inhabited only by strange tropical birds, to Luzon, with its 
millions of people. Luzon has an area greater than the entire 
state of Pennsylvania. The total land area of the Philippine Archi- 
pelago is 120,000 square miles. This is in excess of the combined 
areas of the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Dela- 
ware. It is 7,000 square miles larger than Great Britain. Luzon, 
in the north/ has 46,969 square miles. Mindanao has approxi- 
mately 3G292 square miles. Ten islands, Luzon, Mindanao, 
Samar, Negros Cabu Pansy, Leyte, Bohol, Mindoro, and Masbate, 
contain more than 10,000 square miles each, or 0,400,000 acres. 
Twenty of the islands have between 100 and 1,000 square miles each. 
Seventy-three of the islands contain between 10 and 100 square 
miles each, 2G2 islands between 1 and 10 square miles, and 2,775 



islands, seven-eighths of all, contain less than one square mile each 
The Philippine Islands have a mildly tropical climate. J he nigh 
are cool and LJrle* are unknown. 1 he temperature record f,

PUBLICITY DIRECTOR VISITS ZAMBOANGA 




Mr. Clyde H. Tavenner, Director of 
the Washington Publicity Bureau of 
the Philippine Independence Commis- 
sion, who is in the Philippines for a 
short visit seeking data for his 
publicity work, arrived at Zam 
boanga the afternoon of Septem 
her L'2. He was met at the dock 
by a reception committee and escorted 
to the home of Colonel and Mrs. Waloe, 
w here he was entertained during his 
J stay at Zamboanga. The following 
morning, accompanied by Acting Gov- 
ernor Posadas and a number of Qfllcials 
and citizens, Mr. Tavenner made the 
trip to Taluksafigay by launch, return- 
ing over the beautiful Merced- s road 
by automobile. After lunch at the 
Department Governor's bungalow at 
which there were a large number of 
guests, theSan Ramon Penal Farm and 
Pasonauca Park were visited. In the 
evening there was a reception and 
dance in honor of Mr. Tavenner at the 
Zamboanga Club. 

The following day, September 24th, 
a trip was made to Isabela de Kasilan 
where Mr* Tavenner bad t.he oppor- 
tunity of inspecting the Basilan Rub- 
ber Plantation Company's property 
and seeing the process of rubber 
making from the tapping of the tree 
to the dry rubber packed for ship- 
ment. A banquet was given in honor 
of Mr. Tavenner that night and the 
following day he left on the launcl 
"Research" for Jolo where he will 
spend a few days, returning to Zambo- 
anga in time to leave for Manila by 
the cutter "Mindanao" October 2nd. 

Mr. Tavenner was very compliment* 
ary regarding the beauties of Zambo- 
anga and vicinity and promises to go 



home a real booster for* Mindanao 
At the banquet given at the Plaza 

Hotel in honor of Mr. Tavenner, about 
sixty of Zamboanga's representative 
citizens were present. 

The toastraaster of the evening was 
Hon. Pablo Lorenzo, and the speakers 
were Dr. M. A.Velarde, Mr. P. J. 
Moore, Mr. Alfonso Ma. Ramos, Col. 
H. Gilsheuser, Mr. John J. Hetlingtou, 
Mr. Juan Posadas, Jr., and the guest 
of honor. 

Dr. Velarde spoke at some length 
upon the amount of local and foreign 
capital invested in corporations doing 
business in the Department of Minda- 
nao and £>ulu. According to the doc- 
tor's statement there is at the present 
time about P7,000,000 of American and 
Filipino capital and about P6,000,000 
of foreign capital invested in corpora- 
tions within the Department. 

Mr. P. J. Moore confined his re- 
marks to the business conditions in the 
Department, dwelt at some length 
upon the inadequate shipping facil- 
ities between Manila and the south- 
ern islands, called attention to 
the exhorbitant freight rate, cost 
of transportation between Manila 
and Zamboanga being greater than 
the freight charges between New 
York and Manila. He also spoke of 
the business conditions in Zamboanga 
and the adjacent cities within the De- 
partment, and also of the lack of 
American capital in the Philippine 
[glands, were rubber, coconuts and 
hemp are beiny produced chCaner and 
better than in the Federated Malay 
States, Java, Sumatra and Borneo, 
where there is more than *1 'J.*i.0'JO.M p) 
of American capital invested Jtt rubbei 
plantations alone. 



Mr. Alfonso Ma. Ran >s, Municipal 
Presidente, confined his remarks to 
the Municipal Government of Zambo- 
anga. 

Mr. John J. nettingfon spoke at 
some length of tho work which has 
been done, and is now being done, by 
the School Department in gettin 
Moros and other non-Christ ians 
send their children to the public 
schools. He stated that tin :\rs 
a:;e it was impossible to i he, 
Moros to send their girls to the public 
schools hut now there are a great 
many In school and the number is 
rapidly increasing. 

To Gol. Gilsheuser was assigned the 
subject of Government in the old Moro 
Province, which is now 
within the Department of Mindanao 
and Sulu. His remarks were verj in- 
teresting and very instructive as he 
has had many years of experience in 
dealing with the tribes of Mindanao 
ind Sulu. While in the Constat 
he was Governor of Cotaba ao 
and Lanao and had the opportunity to 
see and participate in tie of 
control which the Government now 
has over the Moros and other non- 
Christian tribes of this Department. 

Acting Governor Juan Posadas, Jr., 
paid the highest compline- he 
United States Army which made p 
sible the establishment of civil gov- 
ernment in Mindanao, paying the 
highest tribute to such able executives 
as General Leonard Wood, General 
Tasker U. Rliss and General John J. 
Pershing. Our present Governor, 
Frank \V. Carpenter, received much 
praise from all of the speakers for his 
able administration of the affairs 
this Department. 

The last speaker of the evening was 
the guest of honor, Mr. Tavenner. He 
stated that he was unable to describe 
his surprise at finding Zamboanga and 
the surrounding countrj 
ful region. He stated that prior to 
coming to the Philippines he had nev 
heard of Zamboanga, and apologized 
for not being better acquainted with 
the Philippine Islands. He said that 
he considers Zamboanga the Paradise 
of the world, and that he will in the 
future endeavor to enlighten the people 
of the United States regarding the 
beauties of Zamboanga arid the sur- 
round country. 

He stated that he is strongly in favor 
of independence for the Philippine 
not because of bis connection with the 
Independence Commission or because 
of his knowledge of Philippine affairs, 
but because he believes that every 
people should have the right of self- 
determination.

December thirtieth is 
I'hilippine Islands. This 



the one greatest day of the year in the 
date will also be observed by Filipinos 
I in every city in the United States where there are any Filipinos to 
observe it. 

December thirtieth is the day on which Dr. Jose Rizal, the na- 
tional hero of the Philippines, was executed. He was condemned 
to death and executed by the Spaniards in 1896 on a trumped up 
rharge of treason. He had been an indefatigable worker for Phil- 
ippine reforms, and had become a thorn in the side of the colonial 
governors of Spain. 

While awaiting death in his cell during his last night on earth 
Rizal wrote a remarkable poem, "My Last Farewell. " He secreted 
the manuscript in an alcohol cooking lamp, where it was found after 
his execution. It follows : 

MY LAST FAREWELL 
By Jose Rizal. 

Land I adore, farewell! thou land of the southern sun's choosing. 
Pearl of the Orient seas! our forfeited Garden of Eden. 
Joyous, I yield up for thee my sad life, and were it far brighter, 

Young, rose-strewn, for thee and thy happiness still would I give it. 
Far afield, in the din and rush of maddening battle, 

Others have laid down their lives, nor wavered, nor paused, in the giving. 
What matters way or pl-ace — the Cyprus, the lily, the laurel, 
Gibbet or open field, the sword or inglorious torture — 
When His the hearth and the country that call for the life's immolation?

Declares It Not Right That Free- 
dom Should Longer Be 
Withheld. 



By FRANCIS BURTON HARRISON, 
Governor-General of the Philippines. 

(First Article.) 



Dawn's faint lights bar the east, she smiles through the cowl of the darkness 
Just as I die. * * * 

Vision I followed from afar, desire that spurred on and consumed me! 
Greeting! my parting soul cries, and greeting again! 0 my country! 
Beautiful is it to fall, that the vision may rise to fulfillment 
Giving my life for thy life, and breathing thine air in the death throe; 
Sweet to eternally sleep in thy lap, 0 land of enchantment! 

If in the deep rich grass that covers my rest in thy bosom, 
some day thou seest upspring a lowly tremulous blossom, 
/ ay there thy lips, 'tis my soul. * * * 

1 nd if at eventide a soul for my tranquil sleep prayeth, 
j 'ray thou, 0 my fatherland! for my peaceful reposing; 
fray for those who go down to death through unspeakable torments; 
rray for those who remain to suffer torture in prison; 
■>,>av for the bitter grief of our mothers, our wives, our orphans; 

)//." pray, too, for thyself, on the way of thy final redemption. 

I hen our still dwelling place wraps night's dusky mantle about her, 
raving the dead alone with the dead, to watch till the morning, 
rrak not our rest, and seek not to lay deaths mystery open. 

now and then thou shouldst hear the string of a lute or a zither n, 
■ ine & the hand, dear country, and mine is the voire that is singing. 

hen my tomb, that all have forgot, no cross nor stone marketh, 
u re let the laborer guide his plow, there cleave the earth open, 
.hall my ashes at last be one with thy Mb and thy valleys 
tie 'lid matter then my country, that thou shouldst forget me! 
all be aT^thySe^^and ' fVf *< Z ?* 

be vibrant speech in thine ears, shall be fragrance and color, 
and shorn 1, Td loved song, forever repeating my message. 

and deep of my sorrows, 
adieu! I am leaving 
Where I go are no tyrants; 
faith, there God is the ruler, 
dear friends of the fireside!

ell, father and mother and bro r ther *'T7he 'end of the long day. 
ful ye should be for me that I rest at comrade! 
'II sweet fro m the stranger's land, ny j r ^ 
7 l dear cm. farewell! To (he ts tores* 



My six years' ex- 
perience as gov- 
ernor-general of 
the Philippine Is- 
lands have con- 
vinced me that the 
Filipino people are 
ready and fit to 
have their Inde- 
pendence. I have 
recommended t o 
Congress, as well 
as to the executive 
admin 1 stratlon, 
that independence 
he granted. 
As to the question of the stability oi 
government, I wish to say to the Am- 
erican people upon my responsibility 
as the governor-general that in my 
opinion there exists today in the I'hil- 
ippine Islands a stable government, 
which I think should answer the re- 
quirements laid down by Presidents 
Grant and McKinloy, and as I under- 
stand it, also by Mr. Koot — namely, a 
government elected by the suffrage of 
the people, which is supported by the 
people, which is capable of maintain- 
ing order and of fulfilling its interna- 
tional obligations. 

I am very glad to go on record :is be- 
ing entirely In sympathy with the as- 
pirationa of the Filipino nation for ln- 
dependence, 

i have recommended to Congress 
that in granting Independence some 
provision be made similar to what is 
known as the Platl amendment in the 
treaty with Cuba, which re itr/cta the] 
abllit.T' of the new republic in borro 



■ I 



prevail. Sueif recommenda- 
tion does not eome as an expression of 
the views of the Filipinos; it Is my 
own view of what would be desirable 
to secure a feeling of confidence and 
satisfaction on the part of all persons 
who have already invested money in 
the Philippines or who contemplate do- 
ing so In the near future. 

lint it is nut right that Independence 
Itself should longer be delayed. 

By temperament, by experience, by 
financial ability, In every way, the 
11,000.000 Filipinos are entitled to 
be free from every government except 
of their own choice. They are' Intelli- 
gent enough to decide for themselves. 

I have found the native Filipino of- 
ficial to be honest, efficient and as ca- 
pable of administering executive posi- 
tions as any men I have met anywhere 
in the world. 

These officials are today governing 
1,000 municipalities and forty-two 
provinces, economically, efficiently and ! 
for the good of the entire people. They 
have a native congress, Including many 
graduates of Yale, Princeton, Harvard 
and other American universities. Oth- 
er members are graduates of Santo To- 
mas and other I'hilippine univer Ities, 
and in education* and ability they com- j 
pare favorably with any I know. 

They have leaders like Speaker Os 
mena of the House of Representatives 
and President Quezon of the Senate 
who would adorn any otlu'e. 

The Philippines are away ahead of 
the [Jnlted states in successful govern- 
ment ownership and opei 
lie utilities. 

The government took hold of th<- 
Steam railways and made them pay a 
profit of j .uoo.uuo pesos a year more 
than under private ownership. 

It took hold of the highways, and 
we have 7,000 miles of the best mac- 
adamized roads in the world. The 
.Manila city government is about to 
take over the street railways and tie* 
gas and electric plants, while the ter- 
ritorial government Is arranging for 
ownership and control of the coal sup- 
ply, 

The movement for Independence is 
a peaceful one. No territory was more 
loyal to Uncle Sam during the war. It 
offered an armed and equipped division 
to our government, gave it a subma- 
rine destroyer and oversubscribed Lib- 
erty loans and Red Gross funds, 

Two million natives speak English j 
fluently, and there are 700,000 English j 
speaking children In the public schools, j 
I am more than willing to retire if j 
e Filipinos can I"? granted what He y

How Would You Like to Harvest Two Crops 

of Corn a Year as They Do in the Philippines? 




No, reader, this corn was not grown 
by one of our local farmers ! It wasn't 
grown in the United States, even. It 
was grown in the faroff Philippine Is 
lands by Filipino schoolboys. Two fine 
crops of corn a year are produced in 
the Islands. 

The Philippines are doing some won- 
derful things in the agricultural line. 
The Philippine government has fine ag- 
ricultural schools throughout the is- 
lands, and the Philippine legislature, 
composed entirely of Filipinos, is each 
year making larger and larger appro- 
priations fcr this important work. 

The staple food of the isiands is rice, 
but corn is coming right along in popu- 
lar favor. Its use was given great im- 
petus in the last year because of a rice 



shortage. Other important Philippine 
crops are hemp, sugar cane, cocoanuts, 
coffee, tapioca and pineapples. Lum- 
ber is also an important industry. 

There are hundreds of thousands of 
acres of land lying idle in the Philip- 
pines; which have a greater area of 
fertile land than Japan— this in spite 
of the fact that the population of the 
Philippines is 11,000,000 while that of 
Japan is around 55,000,000. There is 
every reason to believe that some day 
the Philippines will have a population 
as large as that of Japan today. The 
Filipinos are the only Christian people 
in the orient, and their young men are 
working night and day to prepare 
themselves for the responsibility of 
citizenship in the Philippine Republic, 
which they believe to be near at hand.

the most remarkable or! their kind in the world. They are one of the many 
marvelous sights for the tourist to see in the Thilippine Islands and are to be 
found in the Ifugao district of the Mountain province, Northern Luzon. 

The height of these terraces, which are held up by stone walls, is from 4 
to IS feet, averaging 8 feet high. It is estimated there are 12,121 miles of 
eight-foot stone walls in the Ifugao terraces, which is" approximately half 
the distance around the world. 

These terraces are skillfully irrigated by water brought in troughs along 
the precipitous mountain sides over long distances.

Population 

A census was taken early this year (1919), and while the complete 
reports have not yet been finished, the official estimate cabled to the 
War Department by the Director of the Census is as follows: 

Christian population. 10,000,000 

Non-Christian population 500,000 

Total 10,500,000 

Of this population over 1,750.000 males are qualified voters. 
Native Civilization Prior to Spanish Occupation 

The Philippines were discovered by Magellan in 1521. In 15G5 
the Spaniards made the first permanent settlement at Cebu. In 
1570 they occupied Manila and were in control of the islands until 
185)8, the year of American occupation. 

"The inhabitants of the Philippines possessed a culture of their 
own prior to the coming of the Spaniards to the islands. Those 
along the coasts were the most advanced in civilization. Their 
material wealth was considerable. The chief occupations were 
agriculture, fishing, weaving, some manufacturing, and trade both 
inter-island and with the mainland, generally in the form of barter. 
They were expert navigators. They used standard weights and 
measures. The year was divided into twelve lunar months. They 
had a peculiar phonetic alphabet, wrote upon leaves, and had a 
primitive literature. The majority of the people are said to have 
been able to read and write." (Justice George A. Malcolm, "The 
Government of the Philippine Islands," pp. £7 and 2S.) 

"The inhabitants of these islands were by no means savages, 
entirely unreclaimed from barbarism before the Spanish advent in 
he sixteenth century. They had a culture of their own." (John 
Foreman, an English scholar.) 

"They had already reached a considerable degree of civilization

versity of Santo Tomas Manila, M^tisZ In^ft^S^ 
years older than Harvard); San Juan de Letran, Municipal Anthe! 
gaeum, Normal Schoo , College of San Jose, the Nautical S c hoo e 
School of Commercial Accounting, the Academy of Painting and 
Drawing, and many other private schools, fourteen of whichVere 
in Manila, while others m the provinces must, also be reckoned 
There were seminaries m Manila, Nueva-Segovia, Cebu Jaro and' 
Nuevc-Cacercs, wliere all branches of secondary instruction were 



taught in addition to those which constituted the studies for the 
priesthood. (Data from the American Census of 1903.) 

Progress of the Filipinos During the Spanish Regime 

The famous French explorer of the Pacific, La Perouse, who was 
in Manila in 1787, wrote: "Three million people inhabit these 
different islands, and that of Luzon contains nearly a third of them. 
These people seemed to me no way inferior to those of Europe; 
they cultivate the soil with intelligence, they are carpenters, cabinet- 
makers, smiths, jewelers, weavers, masons, etc. I have gone 
through their villages and I have found them kind, hospitable, and 
affable." ("Voyage de la Perouse autour du Monde," Paris, 1797, 
11, p. 347.) 

Coming down nearly a generation later, the Englishman Craw- 
furd, the historian of the Indian Archipelago, who lived at the court 
of the Sultan of Java as British Resident, said: "It is remarkable 
that the Indian administration of one of the worst governments of 
Europe, and that in which the general principles of legislation and 
good government are least understood, — one, too, which has never 
been skillfully executed, should, upon the whole, have proved the least 
injurious to the happiness and prosperity of the native inhabi- 
tants of the country. This, undoubtedly, has been the character of 
the Spanish connection with the Philippines, with all its vices, fol- 
lies, and illiberalities; and the present condition of these islands 
affords an unquestionable proof of the fact. Almost every other 
country of the (Malay or Indian) Archipelago is, at this day, in 
point of wealth, power, and civilization, in a worse state than when 
Europeans connected themselves with them three centuries back. 
The Philippines alone have improved in civilization, wealth, and 

populousness." ("History of the Indian Archipelago," etc., 
John Crawfurd, F. R. S. Edinburgh, is<20. Vol. ii, pp. 44-7, 448.) 

The German naturalist Jagor, who visited the Islands in 1859- 
1860, wrote: "Assuming the truth of the above sketch of pre- 
Christian culture, which has been put together only with the help of 
defective linguistic sources, and comparing it with the present, we 
find, as a result, a considerable progress, for which the Philippines are 
indebted to the Spaniards." ("Travels in the Philippines," Eng. 
Ed., j). 151.) 

o^! e .^ tri f I lP r( ; fessor ' Ferdinand Blumentritt, wrote in La 
Sohdandad of October 15, 1899, to this effect: "If the general 
condition of the civilization of the Tagalos, Pampangos, Bicoles, 
Bisayans, Ilocanos < agayanes, and Sambales is compared to the

FILIPINO AGENTS PLAN 
DRIVE FOR INDEPENDENCE 

Interlake, Kali spell, Mont., Nov. 29, iSi 

TO MAKE STRONG EFFORT TO GET ACTIcW^T 
DECEMBER SESSION OF CONGRESS, FOR THEY 
BELIEVE NEW CONGRESS IS OPPOSED TO IN- 
DEPENDENCE 



By COL. WINFIELD JONES. 
Washingtno, Nov. 29. — (Special 
Correspondence. ) — Filipino agents 
in the United States who have been 
agitating for Philippine indepen- 
dence for three years, are preparing 
| for a big drive at the December ses- 
sion of congress. This drive will 
endeavor to get the December session 
to grant independence to the islands. 

The Philippine independence situ- 
ation, as regards congress, is as 
follows: The only hope of the Fili- 
pinos to get independence probably 
for many years rests in the Decem- 
ber session. President Wilson has 
declared for independence. If inde- 
pendence is not granted in the De- 
cember session, hopes of it will have 
gone glimmering. It is known deu- 
nitely that a big majority of the 
republican membership of house and 
senate are opposed to Philippine in- 
dependence now, or at any time in

or another, would occupy the islands, 
never to leave them. In one province 
in the Philippines now the Japanese 
own much land and are practically in 
control of that part of the islands. If 
the United States let the islands go, 
this country would be morally bound 
to prevent the Japanese from grab- 
bing the Philippines. War would be 
certain to occur. This is well recog- 
nized, even in the Philippines, where 
many leading natives prefer for their 
country to remain under protection 
of the Stars and Stripes, rather than 
to have it run the risk of a Japanese 
seizure. 

Another objection to giving up the 
islands is seen by congressmen in 
the fact that the Philippies are the 
trade. outpost of the United States 
in the Far East, and therefore the 
base for United States world trade in 
that part of the globe. Without pos- 
session of Hong Kong, in China, Eng- 
land would be badly handicapped in 
the race for commercial supremacy 
in the Far East. Every European 
nation that has a "sphere of influ- 
ence" in Asia is greatly aided by the 
possession of these spheres. Those 
nations that have no "spheres of in- 
fluence" are handicapped in their 
Far Eastern trade. The Philippines 
are better for the United States than 
any "sphere of influence." 

National defense also enters into 
the objections to giving the islands 
independence. With the Philippines 
m American possession, an attack on 
the Pacific coast of the United States 
97 any Asian power, would neces- 
sarily be halted at the Philippines. 
A hostile navy would hardly dare to 
.attack the Pacific coast with the* Phil- 
ippines as an American base at its 
back. The islands also would be a 
buffer for Hawaii iu event of war, 
and for the same reason. If war oc- 
curred with Japan, for instance, the >

AMERICAN PRESS SPIRIT OF FAIR PLAY APPRECIATED 

The following letter sent by us to several American w 
papers is self-explanatory; 



"As part of our work to foster the continuance 



present friendly relation between America and the pi 
ippines, we are impelled to invite your attention to v 
issue of (giving date), wherein, in connection with? 
picture of the Princess of Sulu and Miss Carmen a/ 
naldo, you called the latter a "bandit's" daughter. ]J: 
most friendly spirit we would like to inform you thah 
an epithet applied to one of our most revered iiati 
heroes would only serve to create dissatisfaction an !f : 
our people, and would not conduce to the perpetuati 0 J 
that harmony of feeling which thoughtful Americans 1 
Filipinos believe should always characterize our relat' 
ship — irrespective of whether our political independ 
be immediately granted or not. 

"We do not deem it necessary to resort to detailed, 
gumentation to show exactly why the Filipinos oh\m" 
having Aguinaldo called a bandit. We are, however 
miliar enough with American history to know that sue 1 
word, if applied to George Washington, would not o i 
be resented by Americans, but might be the cause 
prosecution on the ground of sedition. The underskp 
has had enough to do with sedition laws for publish 
less reprehensible statements than that, and person- 
that is why he feels the more keenly the many insults a ' 
libels published in American papers against the Filmt 
people — insults which are not actionable by any lab- 
our favor. 

"We are, therefore, forced to appeal to your sense <• 
fairness in the hope that you will cooperate with m 
discouraging the publication by the American press of 
suits against our people, for in that way only can we it 
sure the maintainance of perfect harmony.— GGNiRAnr' 
BENITEZ, Manager." " 

The response to that letter has been most gratifying and 
I we desire to express our appreciation of the traditional Amer 
ican love of fair play, which induced tie newspapers concern 
to recognize the justice of our protest.

The Governor-General of the Philippines 

IT is the customary thing for men in public life to take the 
easier way. But occasionally there appears a man in public 
office who does what he believes is right and honest, even 
when he knows such action will bring upon himself personal 
criticism, misrepresentation and abuse. 

When we meet such a real man, one doing a man's work in 
the world, we doff our hats to him. That is why we wish here 
and now to salute Francis Burton Harrison, Governor General 
of the Philippines. 

Governor Harrison has been bitterly assailed in certain quar- 
ters because of his policies in the islands. Some of the great 
organs of reaction in America have even termed him "un-Amer- 
ican." 

Let us inquire into the basis of this charge. Governor Har- 
rison has frequently expressed his sympathy with the aspira- 
tions of the Filipino people for independence. He declares his 
six years' experience in the islands have convinced him that the 
people are fit and ready for independence. Although he re- 
ceives a salary of $18,000 a year, he says he is ready to step 
down and out whenever Congress grants the Filipinos their 
independence. And he has recommended that Congress act at 
once. 

In those far-off islands, Governor Harrison stands for these 
three policies: The Philippines for the Filipinos, the principle 
that governments derive their just powers from the consent of 
the governed, and the principle of self-determination. 

If in standing for these things Governor Harrison is un- 
American, will the organs of reaction who are undertaking to 
speak for America on the Philippine question kindly inform us 
what America does stand for? Has America changed its ideals 
since it has become great and powerful? Has it changed its 
opinions since it drafted its young men to send overseas to 
fight for self-determination? 

No, we do not think so. We have every confidence in the 
people of America. We know, and we believe the American 
people know, that it is not the policies of Governor Harrison 
that are un-American, but it is the interests back of the bitter 
attacks upon Governor Harrison that are un-American. 

But this man who has the courage of his convictions can 
really well afford to temporarily receive a little criticism, for, 
if the reports of recently returned travelers from the islands 
are true, he has the sincere gratitude and affection of 10,000,- 
000 men, women and children whose cause he is championing 
before the world. The love of a whole people is something 
that not every man can possess. And when it is so well de- 
served as in this case, it is more precipus far than gold. 

When the history of Governor Harrison's administration is 
written he will receive his reward. It will portray him as the 
brave champion of the rights and aspirations of a race of peo- 
n ie Read the history of the world from cover to cover and 
vou will find no exception to the rule that those men who stand 
for human rights are given their just rewards. So it will be 
with Harrison. But those little men who for selfish and parti- 
san reasons are pulling at his coat tails will be unsung and 

Un Francis Burton Harrison has made himself immortal in the 
Philippines. As long as grass grows and water runs his name

'J- II 1111. 



The Filipi ,l ° Woman 

The position of Llic Filipino woman in the Orient is unique. 
* k Midway geographically between the kimono maiden of Japan and 
the veiled lady of India," says an American writer (Emma Sarepta 
Yule, in The Philippines Monthly, 1915), "and alongside of the lily- 
footed ' dame of China is the woman of the Philippines, a woman 
unique in the Orient, a woman in whose development there has been 
neither seclusion, nor oppression, nor servitude." Even before the 
coming of the Spaniards four centuries ago, the Filipino woman held 
a relatively high position. The Spanish discoverers found the 
Filipino woman sharing equally with her husband the rights and 
duties of the home, and in case of his death inheriting half of their 
joint gains. Sometimes the position of the chief official of a town, 
upon his eath, fell to the widow when there was no male heir. 
Christian ideals strengthened the position of the Filipino woman and 
gave her even greater freedom and power. Today she is the mistress 
of the home and the safe keeper of the family funds. Through her 
hold in the home she wields a strong influence in the outside world. 
In business she is the equal, if not the superior, of her mate; and 
politically, though* she does not enjoy popular suffrage, she has 
proven, to quote the American writer again, "in more than one case, 
indeed in very many, that she is an active campaigner of no mean 
order." 

The education of the Filipino woman has broadened her scope m 
life and is making her more interested in the civic activities of the 
Philippines. In 1917 there were enrolled in the primary and inter- 
mediate grades of the public schools 234,905 girls. Filipino women 
are now occupying positions in the Bureau of Education and the 
University of the Philippines. While there is no strong agitation for 
suffrage, it is doubtful whether, when they demand it, their brothers 
will deny it to them. There have been established over fifty wo- 
men's clubs in the Philippines, engaged in social settlement work, the 
improvement of health conditions, and the prevention of infant 
mortality. Writers on the Philippines and observers of Philippine 

conditions have time and again testified to the superiority of women 
in the Philippines, and to I he tremendous influence that they are 
bearing, ami will conlinuc to bear, upon the country and the people. 
"Possibly . . . on these lovely isles where the lotos blooms and 
the cocoanut lifts high its green-crowned head there may evolve the 
alturia of the vision of the suffragette, a land of perfect sex equality 
with chivalry tipping the scale in favor of lovely woman." That was 
the promise* pictured by the American writer who has paid such a 
pleasing tribute to the Filipino women.

times. All the Americans whom I have 
met have been very good to me. My

in the university are just lovely, but I 
cannot help feeling: homesick at times 
because I am missing my father. My

fice for him, for we are very close. He 
is so good to me." 

Miss Aguinaldo is intensely patriotic. 
She does not conceal her resentment 
when she hears or reads of a misrepre-

When General Emilio Aguinaldo was 
leading the Filipino army against the 
American forces twenty years ago he 
probably little dreamed that some day 
a daughter of his would visit the city 
of Washington and would be given a 
great reception at the famous Con- 
gressional Club! And that the wives 
of 120 members of the American Con- 
gress and two wives of members of the 
President's cabinet would call upon 
her to pay their respects ! 

But all this actually happened when 
Miss Carmen Aguinaldo, his nineteen- 
year-old daughter, visited Washington 
recently. And those wives of the Am- 
erican statesmen expressed themselves 
as both charmed and surprised at the 
refined, tactful, college educated young 
miss who greeted them. 

"Miss Aguinaldo was simply delight- 
ful," was the expression of one con- 
gressman's wife. "She was very mod- 
est, yet she acted so natural and thor- 
oughly at home that she captivated ev- 
erybody. " 

On another occasion while in Wash- 
ington Miss Aguinaldo was given a real 
ovation by a Filipino-American audi- 
ence when she recited "My Last Fare- 
well," poem of Dr. Jose Iiizal, the Fil- 
ipino martyr.

"Republic's" Editor Is Called X 
Lafayette^of the Philippi 



Wins Prize Over Lindy! 



mes 



BY HARRY W. FRANTZ 

Washington Correspondent of United Press. 
The Marquis de Lafayette, fearless cham- 
pion of American independence, has a modern 
counterpart in Clyde H. Tavenner, ever- 
ready exponent of Filipino liberty. Lafay- 
ette fought with a sword, Tavenner battles 
with a typewriter. In persistent loyalty to 
the cause of a distant people of different na- 
tionality there is little to choose between 
them. 

Twenty years of his life, Tavenner— 
known in the Capitol as "Tav" — has been 
fighting for Philippine independence. As a 
newspaperman, as a congressman from the 
state of Illinois, as publicity man for the 
Democratic National Congressional Commit- 
tee, and as an independent publisher, he has 
been the foremost American publicist and de- 
fender of the view that the Philippines are 
legally and rightfully entitled to their inde- 
pendence. 

Defending the Filipino aspiration, Taven- 
ner has been inspired in part by patriotism to 
his own country, believing in common with 
his party, the Democratic, that the highest 
ideals of the United States will be served by 
non-involvement in the government of a dis- 
tant country; in part by his personal friend- 
ship with Filipino leaders here and in Manila, 
and sympathy with the Filipino people ac- 
quired during a protracted visit to the Islands. 

Back of every great political cause there is 
usually some unknown and unsung figure who 
by the depth of his conviction or the per- 
sistence of its presentation, becomes pecu- 
liarly a part of it. Tavenner is such a man. 
Any one in Washington who pays attention to 
Philippine afTairs sooner or later will come 
into contact with him. They will find an able 
practical politician, almost too modest for his 
own political welfare; optimistic for any cause 
which he may support; and in his skilful 
writing on Philippine questions they will note 
that consistency, lack of compromise, and 
quality of confidence which marks the master- 
ful political writer. 

A long line of newspapermen, editors, and 
congressmen at the capital have received their 
first instruction on Philippine questions, and 
often their lasting convictions, from talking 
with Tavenner — ever ready with fact, with 
statistic, with historical quotation, and an un- 
selfish word of idealism to press the cause 
which he has made his own. 

Tavenner was a newspaperman in Wash- 
ington when he first became interested in the 
question of United States relations with the 
Philippines. From 1908 to 1912, long before 
the Jones Law had been formulated, he was 
writing articles which made a wide impression 
throughout the country. 

These articles contributed to his election to 
Congress. There, he became a friend of 
Commissioner Manuel L. Quezon, with whom 
he collaborated to promote the passage of the 
Jones Law, the present organic act of the 
Islands In Congress, and simultaneously in 
the public press, he was a leading advocate of 
this important legislation. 

During his years in Congress, from 1913 to 



1917 he was a staunch defender in Congresl 
ot the administration of Francis Burton Har- 
rison, frequently attacked by enemies of in- 
dependence. 

Two years after his retirement from Con- 
g-ess, Tavenner entered the service of the 
Philippines Press Bureau in Washington. He 
was a factor in the long national campaign 
which committed the Progressive Republi- 
cans, as well as the Democrats, to the cause 
of Philippine independence. 

This campaign fell short of its goal because 
of Democratic political reversals, but forced 
the Republicans to make the greatest con- 
cessions yet authorized by them— namely their 
willingness to take up the Fairfield Bill nro- 
viding for larger local self-government and 
an ^ independence plebiscite after a definite 
period of years. This bill never became law, 
however. 

In December, 1923, Tavenner founded "The 
Philippine Republic," the chief magazine con- 
cerning Philippine affairs, published in the 
United States, now widely circulated both 
here and in the Islands. Profusely illus- 
trated and finely written, this magazine has 
attracted wide attention to both political and 
non-political affairs of the Islands. 



,\Vhat was the greatest achievement in avia- 
tion in America in 1927? "Lindy's flights," 
do you say? If so, you're wrong. The Na- 
tional Aeronautic Association gives the Col- 
lier Trophy for "the greaest achievement in 
aviation in America" to Charles L. Lawrance, 
president of the Wright Aeronautical Corpo- 
ration, of Paterson, N. J. It was presented 
to Mr. Lawrance at the White House the 
other day, by President Coolidge. 

It was Mr. Lawrance who developed the 
Wright Whirlwind aircooled airplane engine 
to such a point of perfection that the many 
successful non-stop transoceanic flights of 
1927 were made possible. All the planes that 
succeeded in crossing the North Atlantic and 
in flying over the Pacific from California to 
Hawaii, were equipped with Wright Whirl- 
wind engines. We have heard much of the 
flyers, but very little of the man who made 
their flights possible. This does not trouble 
Mr. Lawrance. He laughs and says, "Who 
ever heard of Paul Revere's horse?" The 
Wright Whirlwind is recognized as the most 
dependable airplane engine in the world. 



The Army War College in Washington has 
just replaced in front of one of its main build- 
ings the statue of Frederick the Great which 
had been in storage ever since the World 
War. It was taken down at a time when 
there was hatred here against everything 
German and because threats were made that 
if not voluntarily taken down it would be

We don't want an operation to sep-

Godino, the Filipino twins who have 
been bound together, back to back, 
since birth. The twins were the cen- 
ter of attraction at the Hotel La Salle 
yesterday, where they stopped on their 
way to Washington; D. C, to continue 
their education under the direction of 
Theodore Yanco, commissioner from 
the Philippine Islands to congress. 

" We get along together fine any- 
way," said Simplico. 

" And, besides, an operation might be 
fatal," sad Lucio.

a side show in which they had been 
exhibited for eight years. Surgeons 
have differed as to whether an opera- 
: tion would prove successful.

WOMEN GIVEN VOTE IN PHILIPPINES 



Manila, Dec. 7— (By Cable).— The equal 
suffrage bill, giving women full political 
rights with men, was passed by a v practi- 
caly unanimous vote in the Philippine Sen- 
ate and sent to the House. 

Sentiment in the lower branch of the 
Philippine Legislature on the question of 
woman suffrage is believed to be about the 
same as in the Senate. It is practically" 
certain, therefore, that the Filipina will 
soon have the vote. Present indications 
are that she will even beat her American 
sisters to the ballot box. 

This prospect means that the Filipino 
woman, who has been more or less in the 
limelight ever since American occupation 
of the islands, is going to now be in the 
world's spotlight more than ever. The 
Filipina has many admirers who predict 
she will make good in her new role, just 
as she has made good in the very impor- 
tant role that she has occupied in the 
family and business life of the Philippines 
ever since the introduction of Christianity 
in the islands three centuries ago. 



"America's advent in the Philipptn 
discovered a wonderfully interesting, r 
sponsive little being, the Filipino woman 
writes one American concerning the Kil 
pina. "Mothering the only Christian pe< 
pie in the Far East, she holds a place i 
authority, love and respect in family ai 
social life that is not accorded to womc 
in countries neighboring the islands, or 
India, China or Japan." 

The Filipino woman is by custom tl 
dictator in the home. She is usually tl 
keeper of the family treasury. All revemi 
no matter by whom earned, is turned qv< 
to the wife and mother, and she it i- w 1 
has the final say as to how it is to I 
spent. 

^ In business, it is the verdict of the fp 
cigners in the islands that the women \ 
business nearly on Western principli 
Practically all of the small shops in Mini 
arc conducted by the Filipina. The mo 
prosperous contractor for sand and j; ax- 
in Manila is a woman. The best payjq 
iron nrnc in the islands is owned ar

managed by a woman. Frequently wom- 
en are sole or part owners in rice mills 
and similar enterprises. The Filipina's suc- 
cess in business is largely due to her 
promptness in filling orders and her square 
dealing. 

In dress, the Filipina has all the love of 
personal adornment that is characteristic 
of the sex in other lands. After one has 
become accustomed to the native dress, it 
is realized that she is neat and particular 
about her attire. The stiff, wide sleeves 
and specially folded wide collar, the most 
individual feature of her costume, arc al- 
ways fresh, never mussed or wrinkled. The 
same may be said of her sweeping starched 
skirt. Her straight black hair is simply 
dressed and is invariably smooth z.nd neat. 

The education of the Filipino woman 
has broadened her scope in life and is mak- 
ing her more interested in the civic activi- 
ties of the Philippines. In 1917 there were 
enrolled in the primary and intermediate 
Krades of the mihHr srhnofe 234.005 cirls. 



Filipino women are now occupying po- 
tions in the Bureau of Education and tl 
University of the Philippines. There run 
been established over fifty women's clul 
in the Philippines, engaged in social setft 
ment work, the improvement of heali 
conditions, and the prevention of infai 
mortality. 

The doors of each of the several CO 
leges of the University of the Philippih 
stand open and she passes in side by sic 
with her brother. She meets him on tl 
tennis court, plays his game of volley ba 
basket ball and roots vigorously for In 
favorite on the baseball diamond. Thej 
are about 555 girls enrolled in the Unive 
sity of the Philippines. Of the 12,303 Ei 
ipino teachers employed in the publ 
school, 3,982 are women. The reporj 
the Bureau of Labor gives 7,624 worn', 
over 16 year of age and 1,209 under 
years employed in sixteen different kinds 
factories.

tr'ffl-A-" We have heard a number of criticisms concerning ©Auditions aboard the

some of them are justifiahle^Dut -we think- it only fair to those responsible, 
■that the oircuinirfcanoes -which caused these conditions., should he eoaiuerated at

harshly, and feel that they were not altogether unfortunate in beingm re-

in Siberia "waiting to be returned to the United States for Discharge, it ms de- 
cided advisable to us© "Uh$ Great Northern for Ijhis Emergency. Captain Porta,

Scmotimas Ttflien.UovoraX amusement organizations plan to entertain at the 
sane place on the sane night there is friction, but such was flofc from the case last 
evening. The Band had arranged a concert for the men in the Mess Hall last evening 
and had posted notices to that effect, and unbeknown to those who ^7ere arranging to 
stage a riamoth vaudeville show for the same place. This coincidence resv.ltod in 
one "Joy" Program for these who -were fortunate in being present, as they were not 
only fovored rath a splendid band concert, but a Top Notch Variety entertainment • 

The Band never played better and the thirty minute concert which they gave 
was only an aggravation, for xt€ granted more. Everyone seemed in tune with then, 
and they would have willingly given a much more extensive program had no vaudeville 
"been scheduled to follow. 

Our old friends the "Jazz" Orchestra knew they would have to step some to 
keep in line with the pace the Band had set, and they more than made the grade. 
It was a battle royal between both of these "Joy" producers as to which would win 
the penant. As the judges could come to no decision it was considered a draw.

ILIPINAS GET 
BALLOT BEFORE 
AMER. SISTERS 

Senora de Veyra Describes 
Status of Women in the 
Philippines. 



The Filipino woman i s destined to 
; Be in the world's spotlight more than 
ever before as a result of the news just 
received by cable from Manila to the 
effect that the Philippine senate has 
passed the equal suffrage bill giving 
women full political rights with men. 
This would indicate that the Filipina 
may beat her American sisters to the 
ballot box. 

The Filipina has many admirers who 
predict she will make good if she get s 
the vote, just as she has made good in 
the very important role she has oc- 
cupied in the family and business life 
of the Philippines ever since the In- 
troduction of Christianity in the is- 
lands three centuries ago. 

"America's advent In the Philippines

responsive little being, the Filipino wo- 
man," writes one American concerning

SOME FACTS AND 
FANCIES ABOUT 

THE PHILIPPINES 

— 

There Has Been Much Misrepre- 
sentation in America About 
People and Conditions. 




By MAXIMO M. KALAW, 
Secretary of the Philippine Mission. 

A. certain lady 
the Sr. Louis 
Exposition saw at 
a b a 1 l r o o m a 
i> r o w n complex- 
loned man In fault- 
less evening dress 
and accosted him 
with the inquiry, 
"1 suppose you are 

Japanese, sir?" 

The man ad- 
dressed r e pi led, 
M NOj madam." 

"Then you must , 
he Chinese,." she 

k \ am not 




I am a Filipino,'* he replied. 

-How's that?" asked the lady. "I 
thought they were all savages living in 
the woods." 

"Well, 1*11 tell you how I came here," 
he said. "A month before I left the 
Philippines I was living In the woods, 
but the American Governor decided to 
catch as many wild men as possible, 
train them and send them- over here. 
So here I am, just as you see. 1 ' And 
the St. Louis lady actually believed 
him. 

That is what you would call fancies 
about the Philippines. The fact is, 
however, that the 11,000,000 Filipinos 
and their ancestors have been civilized 
and Christians for 300 years; that the 
non-Christian population, according to 
the census of 1918, is only 500,000, and 
even these are not all uncivilized. 

Another fancy Is that not until the 
coming of the Americans were school 
buildings seen In the Islands, roads 
built, or substantial houses erected. 
l>o you know that for hundreds of 
years the Filipinos have had colleges 
and schools and that the University of 
Santo Tomaa is only twenty-live years 
older than Harvard? That as early as 
1866, out of o population of 4,009,000 
people, there were 841 schools Cor boys 
and SM for girls? That in 1892, eight 
years before the coming of the Ameri- 
cans, there were 2.1.T7 schools? 

"To grant self-government to Luzon 
under A guinn I do would ho like grant- 
ing Kelf-governjprJft to an Apache res 



ervation under some local chief. " Thus 
spoke a former President of the United 
States during the Filipino-American 
war. Exaggeration could be an excuse 
at a time when the dignity of the Am- 
erican people demanded the extinction 
of Filipino opposition, but»do you know- 
that the Philippine Republic, before the 
American occupation of the Islands, 
had the approval of prominent Ameri- 
cans who were on the spot — like John 
Barrett, Director of the Pan-American 
Union, who compared it favorably with 
the Japanese government? That Ad- 
miral Dewey considered the Filipinos 
better fitted for self-government than 
the Cubans? That they had drafted a 
constitution at Malalos which elicited 
the approval of distinguished Repub- 
licans like the late Senator George F. 
Hoar? That before the coming of the 
Americans they had produced national 
heroes like the martyred Jose llizal 
pronounced by a Republican congress- 
man. Representative Cooper, as tho 
noblest victim that has ever fallen \ml 
the clutches of tyranny? 0 

And do you know that the Fin nJn 
have not had for hundreds of years 
caste system; blood distinction Zrl*y£ 
families, and that, unlike their orient 
Sisters they are, ho only Christian 
pie in the orient?

That it is higher than in any country 
of South .America, higher than the lit- 
eracy of the Spanish people, and un- 
questionably above that of any of the 
new countries recognized in Europe. 
Do you know that there are a million 
and a half farms in the Philippines 
and that 96 per cent, of these farms 
are owned by Filipinos. In other words, 
that out of the 11,000,000 Christian 
Filipinos, 8,000,000 of them at least live 
on their own farms, with houses of 
their own, independent of any absentee 
landlord or foreign master? That 91

sisting of houses and lands is owned

only 9 per cent, is in the hands of for- 
eigners? Yet these are facts cabled b3

Philippine Press Bulletin, March, l9;;o* 

TO FRIENDS OF IRISH 

INDEPENDENCE IN THE 

AMERICAN CONGRESS 

For the second time in a period of nine months the United States 
Senate on March 18th went on record as being in sympathy "with the 
aspirations of the Irish people for a government of their own choice.'' 

Still another way for the friends of Irish independence in the 
American Congress to make an impressive argument would be to 
grant the independence that the 10,500,000 inhabitants of the Philip- 
pines have repeatedly demanded. America's own representatives in 
the islands have officially reported they are ready for independence 
and have recommended that such independence be granted. 

We submit that the granting of Philippine independence would 
be likely to be accepted by Great Britain as even stronger proof ofj 
America's belief in self-determination than the passage of the Irish' 
resolutions, because Great Britain's councilors of state could not thenl 
successfully make the point the American Congress is asking Great 
Britain to do something that the United States itself has been asked| 
to do and has not done. 

The Filipino people have confidence in the word of America, and' 
hope that now that the Senate has reiterated its sympathy with the! 
principle of self-determination, it will give Great Britain and thej 
other powers of the world a concrete example of consistency and 
good faith by granting Philippine independence. 

AMERICA'S GOLDEN 

OPPORTUNITY 

When the United States went before the world as the champion 5 
of the late lamented "Fourteen Points" it was absolutely sincere. The f 
American soldiers who went into battle and to death with the spirit I 
of crusaders were justly inspired by the belief that they were fighting / 
and dying for the principles enunciated in the "Fourteen Points." < 

The "Fourteen Points" constitute the most just international 
moral code ever penned by man. It compares with the Ten Com- ,t 
mandments. v 
But the "Fourteen Points," or at least many of them, have been I 



.s 



I i Ll L LllV^ JL Ulll L^v-u J- wiiito, »-»■*- j 7 

lost sight of. This was not because America was unwilling to abide 
by them, but because, it is explained, the diplomacy of the old world 
would not "stand hitched." 

There is one of the points, however, that the United States can- 
not escape responsibility for. That is the most important point of all, 
the principle of self-determination. 

The United States cannot successfully maintain before the world 
that the principle of "self-determination" has not been applied to the 
Philippine Islands because of "old world diplomacy." That alibi will 

not do. . ill 

America today has a golden opportunity to prove to the world 
that it was absolutely sincere in championing "self-determination" by 
"•ranting immediate independence to the Philippines. If it does not 
do so it cannot excuse itself by blaming "old world diplomacy," be- 
cause the United States in this instance is free to act regardless of the 

old world. , , , ™. 

In the Jones law the United States solemnly promised the luli- 
pinos that it would withdraw American sovereignty from the islands' 
as soon as they could establish a stable government. The highest; 
American official in the Philippines, the governor-general, has offi- 
cially reported to his government that the Filipino people have estab- 
ished the specified stable government. He recommends, therefore,} 
that independence be given. ... 

Last year the Filipino Legislature sent a special mission to thei 
United States to ask immediate independence. Congress did not act. 
The fifth Philippine Legislature, which has just adjourned, passed a 
resolution reiterating the request for immediate independence And 
now a second mission is on its way to America to ask the United 
States to make good its promise. 

Sooner or later the entire world is going to take note that the 
Filipino people are knocking at the doors of the American Congress, 
askine- for their promised liberty, and that they are not getting it. In 
connection with the incident the world is very likely to recall that it 
was America that championed the principle of "self-determination j 
in the world war. Will this not be embarrassing to America and 

sS S the United States intends ultimately to grant independency 
to the Filipino people, why should it delay living up to its obligations 
Xr America's own representatives in the Philippines have reported 
that th™ Filipino people have earnestly fulfilled their part of the 
covenant? The time to pay a note or meet an obligation is when it 
becomes due. To delay action after that moment is a policy to be 
avoided.

n 



Some of those who oppose independence at this time grant 
that the Filipinos have established the stable government upon the 
existence of which Congress solemnly promised to withdraw Amer- 
ican sovereignty from the islands. But they say Congress is too 
busy to consider Philippine independence. 

Congress, however, was not too busy to pass a resolution ex- 
pressing sympathy with the aspirations of the Irish people for free- 
dom. And it was bound by no promise to do so, while it is bound 
by a very definite promise to act in the case of Philippine inde- 
pendence. 

In the words of Philippine Senate President Manuel L. Quezon : 
"How can America give her recognition, nay, her assistance and 
co-operation to the independence of the Czeco-Slovakia, Poland, 
Jugo-Slavia and others, and withhold them from the Philippines? 
These countries have had no experience in self-government. The 
Philippines have had six years of it. Our experiment in self-govern- 
ment has been pronounced by America's own representatives a 
success." 

As a matter of fact, Congress could very quickly carry out its 
promises to the Filipino people, and thus give to the world, as well 
as to all Americans, unanswerable proof of its sincerity in cham- 
pioning the cause of self-determination in the recent war. 

When America was weaker than it is now, it stood for the prin- 
ciple that governments derive their just powers from the consent 
of the governed. Now that it has become great and mighty, it 
surely will not be content to stand for less. 

And there is no possible chance for the United States to make 
a mistake in granting the Filipinos the independence that was 
promised them. History does not record an instance of where the 
extending of human liberty proved a mistake. Wnen Congress 
makes good its pledge to 11,000,000 men, women and children of 
the Philippines, it will not make the glorious flag of America stand 
for less before the world, but for more. It will, indeed, add new 
lustre to the flag of the republic. Praises will be sung by the weakj 
and struggling peoples throughout the world. 

Again, in the words of Senate President Quezon: "Wha^ 
grander name would America have after the final fulfillment of her 
promise to set the Philippines among the free nations of the world ! 
God speed the day for that joyful event, not only for the happiness 
of 11,000,000 Christian people," but for the greater glory of America, 
so that she may tell the world that her dream for a better age for j 
the weaker peoples is not a mere delusion and a snare but a reality F 
based on her own experience with the Filipino people, whom she ; 
has led gently by the hand until they are able to establish a repub- j 
lie, the first really democratic republic in the East." 

The Philippine-American question has now reached such a I 
stage that it is no longer the Filipinos, but America, that is on trial. 
The Filipinos have earned their freedom by fulfilling the conditions j 
imposed by the United States as necessary prerequisites to the' 
granting of independence, and they should be given it. ^ They should 
be given it now, for to delay justice is in itself injustice.

MONDAY, MARCH 22, 1920. 



_ ... By Jose P # Melencio. 
Un this day of days, when all America dedicates its most 
reverential thoughts to the memory of the foremost citizen of 
the country, known as the "Father of the Republic, ,, it is fit- 
ting that we take note of some of the precepts which have been 
laid down by the illustrious personage for his countrymen to 
follow. It was he who wrote that immortal message— "Ob- 
serve good faith and justice towards all nations." 

On the other side of the Pacific a nation of eleven million 
people awaits the observance of a good faith towards them— 
the redemption of America's promise to give them indepen- 
dence. Theirs is a country which like ours is conceived in 
liberty. They, too, have fought battles for the cause of free- 
dom. They, too, have heroes whose labors have been dedi- 
cated to the cause of democracy. 

They have stood by us thru the thick and thin of a har- 
rowing catastrophe. They have nothing but words of praise 
and gratitude for all the good that America has done them. 
They claim nothing but their simple birthright to be like 
America, free and independent. 

They have already formed their plans. Their aspirations 
have been voiced and are known. In their hearts is the un- 
shakable belief that in political independence lies the only 
happiness of their anxious nation. 

Shall we hold out the word of promise to the ear and 
break it to the hope?. Shall we not observe GOOD FAITH 
towards them? Shall we deny them TUSTICR-

| FILIPINOS OPEN 

SPEAKING CAMPAIGN 

fU 9 0 iu m fe'.°-> March. — Declaring 
that the iMlipmo people are unitedly for 
independence and that they expect Amer- 
ica to make good its promise without fur- 
ther delay, Jose P. Melencio, considered 
one of the ablest of the Filipino orators 
now in the United States, presented the 
case for Philippine independence to the 
student body of the University of Ohio. 
Mr. Melencio is Acting Director of the 
Philippine Independence publicity cam- 
paign in the United States. 

The speech really marked the opening 
of the Filipinos' speaking campaign 
throughout the country. It is declared the 
movement to obtain independence will not 
end until Congress concedes "self-deter- 
mination." 

"The American people, through their 
•epresentatives in Congress, solemnly 
jromised independence to the Philippine 
islands," said Mr. Melencio; "but, unlike 
)thcr promises, there is no way of making 
\merica fulfill her promise. The Filipinos 
lave to rely exclusively on the magna- 
nimity of the American nation, hence the 
lecessity of appealing directly to the 
/oter. 

"I take it that you already know how 
stubbornly the Filipinos 'resisted your 
:oming to the Philippines, how with fire 
and shell and bolo they showed the world 
mat they did not desire to be governed 
without their consent. I am sure you do 
not now blame us, for our only crime was 
that we believed in the immortal Amer- 
ican principles of your Declaration of In- 
dependence and desired to set up a gov- 
rnment of our own choice. 

"But I refer to that old misunderstand- 
ing merely in order that you may better 
judge the Philippine issue as it is today, 
for the Filipinos have all but forgotten 
the feeling that once existed. Twenty 
years of American tutelage have con- 
vinced them that America did not come 
to the Philippines for colonial glory or 
aggrandizement nor for commercial gain, 
but to infuse a new life into our newly 
awakened nationalism, to lift the level of 
our attainments to a still higher level and 
to lead us gently by the hand until we 
were ready to set up a government of our 
own. 

"President McKinley said it was Fili- 
pino liberty and not American power, 
Filipino welfare and not American gain, 
that America would seek to enhance, and 
this has been your policy. 

"But now America's task in the Philip- 
pines is done. We today have the stable 
government upon the existence of which 
Congress solemnly promised to withdraw 
American sovereignty. 

"The granting of Philippine independ- 
ence will be the greatest example of inter- 
national square dealing in history. To 
the everlasting credit of the United States 
it will mean a vindication 'of the rights of 
mall and weaker nations to exist side by 
side with the great powers unhindered 
md unafraid." 

Very sincertly yours**

THE CITIZEN 



Former Congressman Pays Tribute to Harrison 

and the Filipinos 



Once in a while we come across the utterances of responsible Americans to whom the problem of granting the Fili- 
pinos independence and the justice of their aspiration for it are synonimous with the spirit that makes of American institu- 
tions the envy of peoples that still shoulder the weight of governments built on dynastic successions or the triumphant as- 
cendency of titled class and militaristic clan. In the following address of former Congressman Tavenner, delivered in Wash- 
ington D. C. y at an entertainment given by the Filipino Club on the occasion of the last Rizal Day, there is a tribute paid to the 
Filipinos and to Governor General Harrison for the splendid work done here during the Democratic regime. Mr. Tavenner 
spoke thus: 



The Most Hospitable of Any 
People 

"Ladies and pentlemen : I sec that 
I am on the program to give my im • 
pressions of the Philippines. The 
first impression, as well as ray last,- 
and one that I will carry with me to 
ray grave, was that the Filipino 
people arc the most appreciative 
people, and the most hospitable, of 
any people that I have ever come in 
qontac^ with. 

"Another impression that I re- 
ceived there, and I regret to have to 
report it, was that no matter how 
efficiently and how successfully the 
Filipinos may be able to conduct 
their government, there are some who 
will forever withhold their 0. K. 

America Should be Proud of 
Governor Harrison 

"Another impression, and a strong 
one, that I received in the islands, 
was that America has as its repre- 
sentative there in the office of the 
Governor-General, a man of whom it 
Offal well be proud. In those far-off 
islands, a land of thousand delights, 
Franois Burton Harrison is speaking 
the language of America. He is doing 
a man's work. If he is criticised in 
some quarters in the United States, 
the Filipinos should think not one 
whit the less of him, for I can say to 
them f ] governor general who 

hi ever go there and have the 
courage to say that the Filipino 
pfeople had justly earned their inde- 
pendence, and should have it, would 
draw criticism from the same quar- 
that Governor Harrison has 
drawn it. 

Filipinos Will Revere His 
Name Forever 

"My impression, received from 
talking to many Filipinos, was that 
(Ik* Filipino people are deeply and 

rnestly appreciative of the work 
of the present governor general, and 
the his name will be remembered and 
red as long as there are any Fili- 
pinos left to remember and revere it. 



mired. I found that while he himself 
had not had the opportunity of ob- 
taining an education, that there is no . 
'ambition so dear to him as to see 
that his own children take advantage 
of the opportunities to obtain the 
education that he himself was denied. 
The father of the very poorest fam- 
ilies have been known to make tho 
greatest sacrifices, such as even 
mortgaging their homes, their cara- 
baos and even their household goods 
in order that their ehildren may go to 
school. Ladies and gentlemen,I sub- 
mit there is no argument to be found 
against independence in that kind of 
a citizen. Show me a race of people- 
in which the old men, even though 
they may be poor and even ignorant 
be* hey never had an opportun- 

ity to learn, are willing to sacrifice 
so much to keep in school their chil- 
dren who are to be the coming gen- 
eration, and I will show you a people 
that have the characteristics of a 
race that is destined to make pro- 
gress. 

Philippine Mission Typical of 
the Filipinos 

Kor do I believe that the Philip- 
pine Mission is not typical. It is 
just as typical of the Filipino people 
as wjaa that body of men that Am- 
erica sent to tho peace conference 
Nor did the Philippines exhaust their 
supply of competent men in the per- 
sonnel of that one mission. 

The Philippines could send 500 
missions to the United States, and 
if they are not granted their inde- 
pendence I believe they will do it too. 
There is material for a dozen mis- 
sions right here in the U. S. VHiy, 
if it should become a necessity, I 
think Mr. DeVeyra could organize a 
w ry competent little Mission of Fi- 
lipinos who are right here within the 



me with kindness" 



regime. 

in his My last Farewell, transmitted 
his mission to his countrymen, and 



A Character to be Admired 



Before 1 had been in the Philip- 
pine Very lonir V was informed that 
pie Philippine Mission was not ty- 
ical of the Filipino people as a 

ole; that if I wanted to seo the 
(vpieal Filipino I must meet an old 
i no. the man who plants the rice and 
works in the rice field. 

"I do not think it very generous to 
lviVr to the old tao, the man who has 
never had a chance to obtain an 
education. But I met the, old man' 
who labors in the rice fields, and Ii 
^w^^Wt^a^bo^a^ked onfr.traifcl 
mad< him b rharacter h nd 



Mv impression of the Filipino 
*i • u i. iu „™ „ „«^r onvn • as long as time lasts they will carry 
people is that they are a very earn- fe J 

est people; I doubt it' there is a more orL 
hospitable people anywhere in » the 
world. While I was in the Islands 
I could not help but recall a con- 
versation that I had with that great 
and proven friend of the Filipinos, 
Mr. Jones of Virginia, the author of 
the Jones law, I asked him one day 
why he did not go to the Philippines 
on a visit. I told him that I thought 
the Filipino people would be very § 
glad to welcome him there. "That's 
just it," he said. "I am afraid they 
would kill me with kindness." 

Literacy among Filipinos 

After having been in the Philip- 
pines and enjoyed the hospitality of 
the Filipino people I can understand 
that he knew the Filipino people right 
well. ' 

The Filipinos are not an illiterate 
people. The census just being com- 
pleted shows that even including the 
non- Christian tribes, 70 per cent of 
the inhabitants over 10 years of age 
are literate. This is a higher per- 
centage of literacy than that of any 
of the South American republics, and 
higher than that of any of the new 
republics that the allies are support- 
ing in Europe. And most important 
of all, the literacy of the people will 
increase with each new year, because 
of the constantly increasing appro- 
priations for education. Most of the 
Filipinos that T came in contact with 
spoke at least two or three languages, 
which I thought quite remarkable for ] 
a -so-called illiterate people. I could 
speak but one language, and I was 

frequently very much embarrassed

Are Eager for Independence 

Not only are the people eager for 



hearing of fry voice. He could put education, • but they are eager for 
in a few Filipino women members, iudenpendence. They are unanimous 
and Start right in his own household, in their desire for it. Furthermore,

But let us assume that the critics

^ILIPPIPJE TRAVELOGUE 




The Zigzag on the Way to Baguio, Summer Capital of the Philippines. 



All aboard ! Let's go ! We're start- 
ing from Manila, the great picturesque, 
Americanized Oriental city, and will 
travel by automobile 200 miles to the 
north to Baguio, the summer capital of 
the Philippines. The trip can also be 
made by train. 

We have ahead of us one of the most 
scenic, spectacular and thrilling auto- 
mobile trips in the world. We will 
have .excellent roads all the way. The 
Philippines are, in fact, a paradise for 
autoists, possessing 3,500 miles of fine 
macadamized roads. 

The first part of the trip is through 
typical small towns and then across 
the central plain of Luzon and through 
several rich and fertile provinces, 
where tropical vegetation is seen at its 
best. Here one is impressed with the 
great agricultural wealth of the Philip- 
pines, which represents one of the 
East's greatest producing areas, with 
the advantage of immense natural re- j 
sources for the development of further 
production. It is regrettably true that 
even in the United States there is far 
from any real understanding- of the 
potentialities of the islands. 

At some points rice fields, looking in 
the distance like the greenest of green 
lawns, stretch away as far as the eye 
can see. If you want color, if you 
want to feel the romance and mystery 
of an Oriental twilight, pass this way 



plicate. So what's the use of trying ! 

True, these are but impressions, but 
the traveloguer considers himself justi- 
fied in mentioning them, for they are a 
part of the trip to Baguio and return. 
Indeed, the gorgeous sunsets in all 
parts of the Philippines leave an im- 
• pression on the mind of the tourist that 
is everlasting. 

We leave the palms and tropical 
foliage and enter the zone of rugged 
pine. We pass from the soft, incense 
laden air of the warm lowlands to the 
crisp, invigorating ozone of the tem- 
perate zone, all within a few hours' 
time. 

For mile after mile the road now fol- 
lows the tortuous course of a river, the 
road lying in the bottom or on the 
rocky sides of a granite canyon. 

The Philippines are rich in hydro- 
electric possibilities. This power is the 
cheapest power on earth. And it is 
everlasting. Your traveloguer is nei- 
ther a prophet nor the son of a proph- 
et, but he predicts that one day there 
will be innumerable Philippine govern- 1 
ment ownedj.hydro-electric plants in 
this canyon' we are now passing 
through. Think of the possibilities of 
sifch a project! Today the trip from 
Manila to Baguio is loo expensive for 
the average Manila worker and his 
family, many of whom may live and 
die without beholding the wondrous 
beauties of their own island of Luzon. 
Think of what a blessing it. would be 
to Filipino mothers and children to

he is on the rim of the world. Some of 
the turns are so sharp it is impossible 
to see 20 feet ahead, and we seem to 
be perilously near the jumping ui 
place. We wonder if it is safe to lean 
» out and peer into the canyon far belo\ 
and when we do we are perfectly 
isfied we are flirting with death. Yet 
the trip is a safe one, providing oui 
driver has better nerves than our own. 

All too soon we reach the outskirts' 
of Baguio, a city among the cloud 
and are rather surprised at the modern 
city we find it to be. In ten years r»a- 
guio has grown from a village of huts! 
to the now justly famed mountain r< 
sort of the Philippines, sometimes call- 
ed the Philippine Simla. It is un- 
doubtedly destined some day to beco; 
a large city. 

Baguio ranges in elevation from 
4,500 to 5,500 feet and is surrounded ; 
practically on all sides by high moun- j 
tain ridges and "hogsbacks" towering 
into the skies at a height of almost 1 
8,000 feet. 

Aside from the scenery, which 
noteworthy, the great blessing of Ba- I 
guio is its temperate climate, which 
indeed a godsend to those impoverish . 
ed by the tropical temperatures of the 
lowlands. Not only is the mountain^ 
air rich in ozone, but it has been dem- 
onstrated to he extraordinarily free* 
from germs of all kinds. 

Each year during the hot season tin • 
, school teachers of the entire archipela 
go are enabled by the government t< 
! spend a month at the teachers' camp 
j in Baguio for recreation and confer- ' 
■ ence on school work. American army ' 
officers and their families also go t<» 
Baguio for the hot months. 

And now that your traveloguer has i 
you in Baguio, he believes he will leave 
you there, for there are many inter* 
ing side trips to take, and, besides^ 
Baguio is the most delightful place for 
a vacation in the entire Orient.

jV' n In this issue of The Herdtj^is reprinted an editorial 
^in the^tete&fc issue of his ma^Kine, t o r e a ch Manil a, pu- 
blished above his name and titled "A Heart To Heart 
Talk From Editor To Reader". Those who know Mr. 
Tavenner will readily understand his message in this 
editorial; these who do not know him will want to be 
enlightened on many points before being able to com- 
prehend his confession of emotion and faith. We are 
glad to take the occasion to bring to the knowledge of 
thousands of Filipinos a man so sincere, so persistent 
and so devoted to the cause of the Filipinos. 

Clyde Tavenner, as an Illinois congressman, met 

Manuel L. Quezon, then resident commissioner in 
Washington, D. C. over two decades ago. Before dab- 
bling in politics, he had been a newspaperman. Mr. 
Quezon, as an alert representative of his people, saw 
that his greatest problem in , Washington was to get 
the ears of the American public. The Philippines need-. 
: ed publicity. Mr. Tavenner knew the great game of pu- 
; blicity and he and Mr. Quezon presently entered into a 
partnership for the purpose of obtaining Philippine in- 
dependence largely through judicious and effective 
press publicity. 

Tavenner organized the Philippine Press Bureau in 
Washington, D. C. ana, while, the Philippine Independ- 
ence Commission furnished the money, he furnished 
the brain. Directors of the bureau came and went but 
Tavenner remained. America began to sit up and take 
notice of the Islands. But he was not satisfied with be- 
ing a mere press agent. As soon as he was convinced 
that Filipinos alone could run the Press Bureau, he 
stepped out and founded The Philippine Republic. 

As he confesses in his editorial, the magazine, 
which is a monthly affair of undetermined size, has 
,never been able to make money. .. It has failed to draw 
oa advertisers for obvious reasons. He has likewise failed; 
to draw Filipino support, and this is the burden of his 
message. But Tavenner is not complaining for any at 
fcihese reasons. ,% We are thinking", he declares, "of^ 
- those Filipinos into whose faces we shall never look a c 
and who will not come until we are gone. ; They wiL r 
know how to appreciate the independenq^that wi;a 
then be theirs". 

Have we known how to appreciate the friendsh:-' 
and support of Americans whojiave seen in our cause** 
cause of their own? This isuwe unending interrogate h . 
which runs through his ^editorial. Charles Edw^ a , 
Russell, Henry Allen Cooper, Clyde Tavenner— to m&t 
tion only a few— seem to have lost our^ favor wP^

Maximo M. Kalaw is 
tab for future reference 
name that has become proinWfy 
identified with the Filipino aspiration 
for independence, a i^me that wiil be 
heard and seen frequently in the 
future. It is a Filipino name that 
hay become particularly well known 
in the United States during- the last 
year, during which time Mr. Kalaw 
has been director of the Philippine 
Press Bureau at Washington. 



"A good man not to cross pens 
with..." 

Mr. Kalaw has just returned to the 
Philippines, leaving behind him in the 
United States a very definite impres- 
sion in the minds of certain 
distinguished college presidents, mem- 
bers of Congress presidential candi- 
dates, et al, that he is a good man not 
to cross yens with on the subject of 
the justice of the Filipino demand for 
independence. 
• Among the editors of America Ka- 
law is known as the man who put 
"pep" in Philippine publicity. 

Widely Known in America 

As director of publicity for (the 
Philippines, Mr. Kalaw has not only 
had an exceptional opportunity to 
make a name for himself in the United 

States, but he has taken advantage of 
that opportunity. >The trutli is that 
he is probably better known through- 
out the United States today than he 
is in his native Philippines.^ 

"The Philippine Misrepresenta- 
tionists" 

Maximo M. Kalaw's presence in 
these parts has had a very ^cTO 
in- not to say dampening, effect on 
th ose writers and public speakers who 

miirlit be dubbed, as a class, as "Phil- 
ippine misrepresentationists." They 
had acquired the habit of writing and 
saving most anything about the Fili- 
pino people that they found handy and 
convenient, providing it supported 
Seir contention that the 
nrit fit for independence, and tiiat 

including men m very high places, Had 
repeated their misrepresentations so 
frequently without opposition that 
they had come to actually believe them 
themselves.

ish and 



Permit us to present the De Veyra 
family. 

The Hon. Jaime C. de Veyra is the 
Resident Commissioner from the Phil- 
■,..> Islands to the United States and 
ias Just heen elected to a second term 
oft! is. As Resident Commis- 

sioner he has a seat on the tloor of 
tbj» American Congress, the privilege 
taking part in debates, although no 

Commissioner de Veyra lias an inter- 
esting Wife and four bright Filipino 
kiddies. The IV Veyra family, individ- 
ually and collectively, constitute the 
argument as to the tact and capa- 
cities of Filipinos that the Philippine 
slands have in Washington. 

The commissioner is a 100 per cent 
Filipino, a Visayan, and is one of the 
foremost loaders of the party in power 
in the islands. During American occu- 
pation he has been successively gov- 
ernor of his province, member of the 
Philippine legislature, cabinet mem- 
ber and executive secretary of the 
I islands. 

Like many statesmen of the Philip- 
nines, he was originally a newspaper 
nan. He was one of the founders of 
;i Nuevo Pia of Cobu, the first Fill- 
no paper published advocating Phil- 
line Independence. The paper came 
Voider the censorship of General Mc- 
Intyre, and on the appearance of the 
first number the editors were left in 
the singular position of seeing every 
prominent article blue penciled. 

Mrs. de Veyra, like her husband, is 



ed States," says Mrs. de Veyra. "I do 
not mean to infer we are perfect; for 
we are not. My people have most of 
the defects, I suppose, that other hu- 
mans have, but at the same time we 
are far from the people that many 
Americans have been made to believe. 
Not only are we a Christian people, 
but our race has a history that we are 
not ashamed of. Throughout the Phil- 
ippine Islands the people are now 
working earnestly to improve them- 
selves and their conditions so they will 
be prepared to take over their own af- 
fairs. We all love America for giving 
us a chance to help ourselves and for 
having promised us our independence, 
which is one of the dearest desires of 
the entire citizenship of the islands." 

To American women whose ideas of 
Filipinos have been founded on Sun- 
day supplement descriptions of wild 
tribes, Mrs. de Veyra's gentle manner 
and evident culture have been a reve- 
lation. She is sought by women's clubs 
because of her charming manner as an 
impromptu speaker on the subject 
nearest her heart — the women of her 
co tm try. 

At a recent Washington gathering 
she gave in perfect Knglish a concise 
account of the work of a woman's club 
in Manila which supplies milk to the 
babies of the poor and trains mothers 
to care for their young children. She 
told of another woman's club which 
has branches all over the Philippine! 
Islands and which maintains day 
nurseries for the children of the work- 
ing women, provides Christmas cheer

ai i« ie for The Providence News, 
setting forth what the Filipinos asl, 
fi^m tho Uhited States. 

* * • 

The time has now come when the 
American Congress should grant in- 
dependence to the 10,500,000 lnhabi 
rants of the Philippine Islands. Such 
action will be to tho best interest of 
both the Philippines and the United 
States. 

Today the Filipino people have 
\hc greatest resect and affection for 
merica. 

If independence is granted in tho 
jear future America will always have 
the good-will of the Filipinos. But if 
America keeps putting the Filipinos 
off, first, with one excuse and then 
with another, the Filipinos will ulti- 
mately fee] less friendly to the Amer- 
ican nation than they do now. 

We base our appeal on the follow- 
ing facts:

dependence, an immortal document. 
It was declared governments dorive 
their just powers from the consent ot

It will be the minion of Isauro 
Oabaldon, who has arrived in Wash 
fngtoa as Philippine resident commis- 
sioner, and as the representative of 

^n i r i 2 %*T M 10 a **M*> the 
cause of Philippine independence. 
That realization is of the utmost im- 
portance, in his view, lls the means 
of preserving the friendly attitude of 
the Filipinos toward the United States, 
for, as he says, the officials and the 
masses in the islands are alike insist- 
ent that Independence be granted. 

"NotJ only do we feel entitled to 
independence by divine right, as the 
American colonies felt themselves en- 
titled* but the United States promised 
as Independence upon the establish- 
ment in the Philippines of a stable 
government. Such a government ex- 
ists. 

"I wish to emphasize that our 
people have very friendly feelings to- 
ward the United States. We fully 
.realize that you rendered us inestimable service in assisting us to prepare 
ourselves to take over_the responsibilities of independence. Now we are prac- 
tically unanimous in desiring a Philippine republic." 

Mr. Gabaldon was formerly governor of the Province of Nueva Ecija. He 
served as representative in the first and second Philippine assemblies. Prior 
to his recent election to the post in Washington, he sat in the insular senate.

"Must «5 hg&rt 
of America beat 
only for the free- 
dom of Ireland, of 
Poland and of the 1 ! 
Czecho - Slovaks,! 
and not for the 
independence of 
the Philippine Is-| 
lands?," 

This was the 
question Resident 
Q o m m i s s i oner 
Isauro Gabaldon 
of the Philippines 
Philippine Resident adressed directly 
Commissioner to the member- 

ship of the House 
Isauro Gabaldon L , 

of Ptepresentaives 

in a speech which was given very 
close attention and was frequently ap- 
plauded. . , 

"At one time," said Commissioner 
Gabaldon, "Congress had before it no 
less than thirty resolutions expressing 
sympathy with the aspirations of the 
Irish people, if not actualy urg^W 

lies were born, and America has re 



heeded. Must there be exceptions, 
then, in international justice? 

"My plea, gentlemen of the Ameri- 
can Congress, is that you ignore no 
longer the repeated requests of a de- 
serving people for an independence 
that rightfully belongs to them. The 
granting of independence now affords 
the United States a golden opportunity 
to give to the world unanswerable 
proof of its sincerity, its consistency 
and its altruism, rt will be the great- 
est example of square dealing in the 
history of the ag^s. 

"Do not think we are not appre- 
ciative of all you have done for us. 
V/e are. America has truly trei ' S 
the Filipino people as no other nation 
has ever treated an alien race in all 
history. The high points of the Amer- 
ican policy in the Philippines have 
been consistently inspired by altruism. 
We know that you were actuated in 
your labors by the desire to contrib- 
ute to our own welfare. 

"And we love you perhaps most of 
I fill for your solemn promise to grant 
I us that which we hold dearer than life , 
tf — our freedom. Independence is 
1 our national ideal. It is our all ab- : 
sorbing aim. It grows stronger every 
hour. For the spirit of nationalism 
never dies. Much less can it be sub- 
dued. We believe -that we can never, 
hope to be a sturdy nation if we are 
to rely forever on the magnanimity of 
the United Slates. 

"America's task In the Philippine j 
Islands is finished. What you have as- j 
sumed as your sacred obligation in 
that part of the world has been ful- 
filled. A people with a medieval sys- 
tem of institutions has been trans- 
formed into a conscious nation, im- 
bued with all that is modern in the 
activities of nations. And if you give 
us independence our gratitude to you 
will increase a thousand fold; it will 
last forever if you keep faith with us. 

"There is but one Issue In the Phil- 
ippine question, and that Is: Is there 
today a stable government on the Is- 
lands? In the Jones law you promised 
independence upon the establishment 
of such a stable government. Your 
own Governor-General has officially 
reported that there Is a stable gov- 
ernment In existence today, and we 
also have submitted plenty of evidence 
to substantiate its existence. There- , 
fore, we hope and expect America will 
now carry, out its pledge." '

sioner, and' WTfie representative of 
his people in Congress, to advance the 
cause of Philippine independence. 
That realization is of the utmost im- 
portance, in his view, as the means 
of preserving: the friendly attitude of 
*ho Filipinos toward tflie United 
('States, for, as he says, the officials 
jand the masses in the islands are 
. alike insistent that independence be 
granted. 

"Not only do we feel entitled to in- 
dependence by divine rig'ht, as the 
American Colonies felt themselves en- 
titled, but the United States prom- 
ised us s independence upon the estab- 
lishment in the Philippines of a .stable 
Government. Such a Government ex- 
ists. The fact has been officially re- 
ported to the Presi dent and to Con- 
press by the American Governor Gen- 
eral, He has had ample opportunity 
to note and to analyzo our ability to 
wern ourselves, for he lias been in

x years. 

"We have demonstrated our ability 
d govern ourselves as often as we 
ave had opportunity to demonstrate

Declares Filipinos All 

Want Independence 

Former Illinois Congressman, Back From Philippines, 
Gives Interesting Views on Island Affairs. 



By FORMER CONGRESSMAN CLYDE M. TAVENNER, 




The 10,500,000 
^ Inhabitants of the 



Philippines are 
practically unani- 
mous in their de- 
sire for Independ- 
ence. 

This Is the 
strongest Impres- 
sion that 1 have 
brought .back with 
me after touring 

0 ^ jffg gWJ the islands from 

« Kvrrz on e end to the 
Cljde H. Tavenner. othe", and after 
having come In 
contact with all classes o' the people. 
I found, however, tlw the viewpoint 
* Americans in t*e Philippines, and 
Americans in ; United States, on the 
mbject of Independence, is not the 
tame. 

The attitude of the American gov- 
ernment, and the great mass of the 
people of the United States, is to con- 
sider the Philippine question from the 
anselfish viewpoint of what Is be*st 
for the Filipino people Ninety-five 
per cent of the opposition to inde- 
pendence emanates from American in- 
vestors in the islands who are quite 
naturally more interested in the size 
of their dividends than the freedom of 
an alien people. 

The unfortunate feature of the sit- 
uation is that the opponents of inde- 
pendence, in order to convince the peo- 
ple of the United States that the Fili- 
pinos should not be granted their In- 
dependence, find it necessary to libel 
an entire race. To tell a sensitive 
Christian people that they shall not 
have their promised Independence be- 
cause they are not fit for it will in 
the end prove a mistaken policy. It 
will only make their demand for in- 
dependence the stronger. 

At the present time, however, the 
masses of the Filipino people still 
have absolute confidence in the good 
faith of America. Their loyalty and 
gratitude to Uncle Sam has not as 
yet been Impaired by the misrepre- 
sentations of the retentionists. Their 
leaders are intelligent enough to dis- 
tinguish between those Americans 
who oppose their aspirations to In- 
dependence for purely elfish reasons 
ln6 the sreat mass of the ^ America n 
neonle whom they know desire this 
E££ment to do by the Filipinos 
onlv that which is Just and right. 

2 Sis connection, it Is interesting 
to review the development of the pres- 
ent friendly relationship between the 
Filipino and American peoples. 
Previous to ijao 



the Philippine- 

affection. otfltude of the Filipino 

The happy a.mude at 
people toward A ^rl c a^ nS 
clpally to the ft.* that ^ ^ 

SSefS one o^J^JX 
cational systems in he wo . 
the building of high cia 
bridges and public works-but is due 



principally to the fact that in the 
Jones law America gave the Filipinos 
her word of honor that as soon a.s a 
stable government could he esTahlish- 
ed we would withdraw our sovereignty 
from the Philippine Islands. 

It might, at first thought, seem 
strange that in their sincere appre- 
ciation of all that we have done for 
them the Filipino people should place 
most emphasis on the promise to groat 
them their independence. For it can- 
not be successfully denied that on the 
whole the United Stares has treated 
the Filipino people better than any 
nation ever treated a dependent alien 
people In all the days since the curtain 
rose on the dawn of civilization. If 
we do not spoil It, it is a record that 
we can be proud of. 

But It really isn't so strange that 
the Filipino should love us more for 
our promise to give them sovereignty 
oyer themselves than for our other 
good works, for which, after all, out- 
side of army and navy expenditures, 
the Filipinos have been taxed, and 
properly so, for every cent of the cost. 
If we but reverse the situation, and 
place ourselves in the shoes of the 
Filipinos, which cannot be said to he 
an unfair way of getting at the other 
fellow's viewpoint, we shall see that 
it is not strange. 

Suppose that Great Britain or any 
other power that you can think of by re- 
ferring to your geography or history, 
should impose its sovereignty upon us 
against our will and then give us aD 
Infinitely better government than we 
now enjoy? Could any such foreign 
power ever succeed in convincing us 
that it had our welfare more at heart 
than we have ourselves. 

But to return to my story, the Fili- 
pinos heartily thanked us for the 
Jones law, considering It a sort of a 
covenant between the Filipino and 
American peoples, and immediately 
applied themselves to the task of set- 
ting up the prescribed stable govern- 
ment And they set it up. It is in 
the Philippines now. America's owe 
representative in the islands, the gov- 
ernor general, officially reports It U 
there and recommends that since th€ 
FUipinos have earnestly fulfilled the 1 
part of the agreement, America shoulc 
be as prompt in carrying out its part 
of the contract. 

So that, in a few words, It Is not 
the Philippines that now are on trial, 
but the United States. 

There is but one answer. Amertce 
will carry out its agreement. Anc 
since we are going to do It, we cannot 
afford to quibble and split hairs anc 
hesitate until our tardiness robs us 
of half the glory of our achievement 
Let us act with a promptness and will- 
ingness really worthy of America. 

Ind when the people of the Unitec 
States set up the Philippine Republic 
as the first Christian democracy oJ 
the Far East, they will be building £ 
monument to themselves that wi 
stand throughout eternity. On that 
day the beacon light of hope, humanity 
and justice will flash around the world 
Such an example by America will ac 
complish more for the weak and strug 
ding peoples of the earth than th 
four year world war, with all its cost 
in life and treasure. 



Ml FILIPINO MmkiYk, 

WRO TE REM ARKABLE POEM 

By FORMER CONGRESSMAN CLYDE H. TAVENNER. 

Filipinos as the anniversary of the 
blrthdav o£ the Filipino martyr, Dr. 
Jose Rizal, regarded as the greatest 
man the Malay race has produced, 

Rizal, who spoke seven languages 
and was a cultured and much traveled 
man (on one occasion he traveled 
across the United States), earned the 
enmity of Spanish governors in the 
Philippines by protesting against the 
oppression of the Filipino people. As 
a hoy he had witnessed scenes that 
sent shafts of grief into his poet 
soul, and he early dedicated his life 
to the liberation of his "land adored.'' 
At the risk Of his life, and iit the 
sacrifice of his career, friends and 
loved ones, he heenme the spokesman 
for the stifled grievances of the voice- 
less multitude, and thus became "the 
living indictment of Spain's wretched 
colonial system." 

'lUizaKconldV: hj.ve saved his life, as 
hejhap JPe^Wafyed by friends not to 
return 'to the islands. He could not 
be dissuaded, but before returning to 
Manila left a letter with a friend in 
Hongkong to be opened after his 
death, in which he wrote: "Gladly <i<> 
I go to expose myself to peril, not as 
any expiation of misdeed (for in this 
matter I believe myself guiltless of 
any), but to complete my work and

myself offer the example of which I have always preached. A man ought to 
die for duty and his principles. I hold fast to every idea winch l have ad- 
vanced as to the condition and future of our country, and shall willingly die 
for it I hold duties of conscience above all else. Besides 1 wish to show 
those who deny us patriotism that we know how to die. for duty and prin- 
cinles " 

While Rizal was In Europe working for Philippine reforms, the Spanish 
governor-general, to indirectly punish Rizal, carried on a relentless persecu- 
tion of his parents and relatives in the Philippines, driving them into exile. 
To his parents Rizal left a second letter, saying: "Should fate go against me. 
lyou will understand that I shall die happy in the thought thai my death w 11 
end all vour troubles. Return to our country and may you be happy in it. 
Till the last moment of my life I shall be thinking of you and wishing you all 
good fortune and happiness." „.,..„„ 
Spain had meanwhile determined on having Rlzal's life, foolishly thinking 
that if his voice was stilled agitation for the reforms he championed would 

end Rizal was arrested on a trumped up charge of treason and cot rnned 

to death But no sooner had the firing squad completed its work than the 
teaching of Rizal almost instantaneously became the passionate Inspiration 
of the whole Filipino race. His. unjust execution had simply trailed the 
mtense §SfotteS ol ..,„..; to the brearts of an entire nation of people The 
V Spine nationalism of today dates from the sunshiny morning ol December 
80 1896, when Rizal was led forth from his prison to willingly give, as he 
himself said, his life for his country's redemption. 

Snile touring in the Philippines recently the conviction was ever presen 
in mv mind and I could not throw It off, that the real Inspiration as well a, 
L iLdersl ip of the Filipino people in their present desire for Independence 
Is the "spirit of Jose Rizal. The memory of Rizal and the desire for ind* 
nendence seem to he synonymous in the mind of the average Filipino. 
P mzal is the inspiration of all classes, of old and young. -fall the people; 
he is not dead, for his spirit is everywhere in that beautiful land His plc 

W ndorns the homes of the poorest families; streets, avenues and ell

,a,hio noem "Mv Last Farewell." He secreted the manuscript In an
