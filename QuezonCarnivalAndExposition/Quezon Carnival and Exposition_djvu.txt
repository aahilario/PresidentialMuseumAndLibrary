{ealizing the magnitude of the role that the people of Quezon (formerly Tayabas) 
should play in the perpetuation and glorification of the ideals and principles of our great 
patriot and statesman, MANUEL L. QUEZON, and to build in his honor a lasting tri- 
bute that will stand tide and time, the Quezon Provincial Exposition was conceived as a 
glowing testimonial of that - -- - - - 

loyalty and devoted af- 
fection the Tayabenses hold 
for their great leader — the 
son of this province and the 
Father of his Country. 

The purpose of the 
Exposition is to raise funds 
for the erection of a fitting 
monument in front of the 
capitol building in the mid- 
dle of the famous Perez 
Park. If and when this plan 
materializes, then there will 
stand in front of our capitol 
site a guidepost and beacon 
light heralding to the peo- 
ple of the Philippines in ge- 
neral, and to the people of 
Quezon in particular, that 
the "Star of Baler" is still 
alive, directing his beloved 
people in these difficult 
times of rehabilitation and 
reconstruction. 

The life of Manuel L. 
Quezon more than ever has 
become a source of glorious 
inspiration to a people just 
recuperating from the tra- 
gedies of war. There could 
be no more fitting descrip- 
tion of his life-career than 
the words of our able exec- 
utive, Honorable Hilarion 
R. Yanza, when he spoke 
at the necrological services 
for this illustrious disciple 
of freedom. "Truly," the 




We, his children bereft, are 
left with a great inherit- 
ance, the fruit of his life- 
time's dream — a free Phil- 
ippines. " 

Those who helped to 
make this Exposition a suc- 
cess — our many friends and 
patrons, our advertisers 
and contributors — as well 
as all those who lent their 
support in an unofficial ca- 
pacity, will find silhouetted 
thru the pag;es of this Sou- 
venir Program a dream- 
monument of that great pa- 
triot, moulded in granite 
and bronze, standing free, 
against an azure ~ky, his la- 
tin nose and heavy eye- 



governor eulogized, "he was 
a great father and benefac- 
tor to all of us. And as 
such, he may be likened to 
a man who planted trees in 
his orchard, daily toiling, 
earing and watching, until 
these trees he nurtured so 
well with his every strength 
were in full bloom. Just 
when he was about to reap 
the fruit of his labors, fate 
intervened and with an un- 
relenting hand took him 
away to the Great Beyond.

Cotta alone about 3 kilometers south of the Capital, scores of vessels 
call every week. This is not the only means of transportation we 
have in the locality. There aie two big Air lines, three big Bus 
transportation companies, and hundreds of other minor operators 
engaged in the transportation bu-inoss. And above all, there is 
the Manila Railroad Company with its bus line that makes several 
trips to Lucena daily. In fact here in Quezon, one can travel by 
air, by land, or by sea. t 

Quezon is the premier cop v a producing province ot the rnn- 
ippine Republic. A total of 164,285 hectares are planted to coco- 
nut trees. As per the 1039 census, there was a total of 18,181,024 
f i uit-bearing coconut trees in the province yielding around 150,000 
tons of copra yearly. 

It embraces 33 municipalities, and contains a road system of 
some G13 kilometers of first class and second class roads, open to 
tiaffic all year round. All the towns in the province are accessi- 
ble either by bus or by boat. 

AGRICULTURAL LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES 

Endowed with abundant agricultural lands and natural re- 
sources, the province of Queron will surelv be among the first 
provinces to effect a speedy rehabilitation and further the economic 
development of our country. 

Our province is principally an agricultural region. More than 
ten percent of its extent, or about 100,000 hectares, so far, now 
constitute the private property with or without Torrens Title, and 
are devoted extensively to coconut plantations and ricefields. More 
than double that area, or about 250,000 hectares, are public lands 
that have been applied for as homesteads or under forms of con- 
cessions. Today lands of the public domain in the province admin- 
istered by the Bureau of Lands for subdivision and distribution 
amount to thousands of hectares. Public lands still available for 
distribution and settlement by landless farmers mav be found in 
Baler, Catanauan, Calauag, Guinayangan, Tagkawayan Infanta, 
CasigiP'an, Polillo and Aurora. 

With copva and coconut products now commanding hirrh prices 
in world markets prosperitv seerrs to be everywhere in the prov- 
ince. More so because the land resources of the province are evenly 
and fairly distributed among the people. In fact there is prac- 
ticallv no landlord-tenant problem in the province. Most of the 
parcels of land are owned by the farmers themselves. Such a 
system makes possible the existe?ice of a strone: middle cla°>s of 
landowners with orlv small landholdings, thereby enhancing the 
over-all economic stability of the whole province. 

FISH. — At present no data are yet ava ; lable on the extent 
of the fish resources of our province. It is conceded, however, 
that sea-coast fishing is one of the maior industries find the chief 
means of livelihood of thousands of people in the coastal towns of 
Quezon province. Truly, the province is a fisherman's paradise. 
In almost all towns like Lucena, Atimonan, Padre Burgos, Pag- 
b'lao, Calauag, Guinayangan, General Luna, Macalelon, Catanauan, 
Mauban, and Alabat, ' there are always a nrreat number of fisher- 
men with their families who have come from other provinces to 
reside there permanently because of the abundance of fish in these 
places. 

MINERAL DEPOSITS: — Though not a mining region, Quezon 
province has its share of nature's bounty in the form of mineral 
resources. Coal, petroleum, iron and lime have been discovered 
in varying quantities in d ; fferent parts of the province. The most 
notable coal deposits are known to be in Polillo Island, while petro- 
leum reserves have been located in Bon^o Peninsula. Small iron 
deposits have been reported to be rear Calauag a^d Guinayangan. 

Lime is being mined commerc'ally in Malicboy, Pagbilao. Unt'l 
now no truly large-scale development of coal, petroleum or iron 
has been attempted. 

FOREST RESOURCES 

QUEZON PROVINCE ranks as one of the first provinces rich 
in forest resources. According to our latest reconstituted records, 
the following table s^ows the soil cover in hectares of this province: 

Commercial Forest 516.550 

Non-Commercial Forest 246.557 

On^i Land 32,500 

Cultivated Land 378,901 

Mangiove Swamp 21,150

It is both with pride and humility that I bear this part in the tribute of respect ro

hectare, this province has a standing timber of 25,827,500 

Allowing a stand of 50 cubic meters of saleable timber per 
cubic meters or over ten (10) billion board feet. As 
not all of this timber can be utilized owing to the inaccessibility 
of most of the places where this timber is growing, and granting 
that only one-fifth (1/5) thereof is accessible, we have an access- 
ible timber of over TWO (2) BILLION board feet, of which 
THIRTY (30) MILLION board feet annually are allowed by the 
Bureau of Forestry to be cut. The reason for limiting the annual 
cut to about 1-1/2% of the growing stock is to preserve the capital 
represented by the standing timber. 

From January to December, 1946 our records (incomplete) 
showed that 34,310,29 cubic meters or 14,553,563 board feet of 
timber were cut. This was less than one-half (1/2) of the annual 
allowable cut of 30 million board feet that our forest can sustain 
without depleting its capital. 

For the privileges of utilizing forest products there are 79 
timber licenses, 81 firewood, tanbark, dyebark. and nipa licenses, 
100 other licenses for other minor forest products, and 1 timber 
concessionaire holding a long term license agreement. Of the 79 
timber licensees, none is operating a sawmill except that one holding 
a license agreement who is operating four (4) sawmills, 1 in Cala- 
ua.fr and 3 in Tagkawayan. There are 2 other sawmills in thi ( 
province operated by non-licensees of the Bureau of Forestry, one 
of which is located in Barrio Binahaan in Pa^bilao and the other 
is in the Poblacion of Tayabas. 

Since the liberation the only forest products exported consisted 
of rattan (raw material and furniture), and Manila copal (Alma- 
ciga). We have plenty of them in this province but we have no 
records of the amount exported. 

INDUSTRIES 

The chief industries of the people of the province are farm- 
ing, fishing, lumbering, livestock raising, and hat, fan and mat 
weaving. Farming is done all over the province especially in the 
coastal plains in the southwestern part and on the slopes of Mounts 
Banahaw and San Cristobal. Fishing is common in towns along 
the coasts. Lumbering is done in places near the forests or in 
the Sierra Madre mountain ranges. This is common in Calauag, 
Tagkawayan, Tayabas and Pagbilao. Hat weaving is done in 
Lucban, Tayabas, Sampaloc, Mauban, Pagbilao, Lucena, Baler and 
Casiguran. Fan and handbag weaving is common in Lopez and 
Lucban. 

FARMING. Farming is still the chief industry of the prov- 
ince. 

COCONUT. Coconut is the most important crop, the area 
devoted to its cultivation representing 80.2% of the total area under 
cultivation or 14.99^ of the total land area of the province. It is 
the crop upon which the majority of the people depend for their 
living. The 166.285 hectares of coconut land are estimated to yield 
around 700,000,000 nuts per year, producing conservatively 140,000 
tons of copra. If the present price of F300 per ton is maintained 
for one vear, tin's industry will bring to the people of the province 
P42,000,000 in 1947. 

RICE. Rice is next to coconut in importance. The present 
estimated area planted to this crop is 36,843 hectares, 17.7% of the 
total area of land under cultivation or 3.27r of the total land area 
of the province. Of the total area of riceland, 17,593 hectares 
are rainfed (sahod-ulan) , 9,622 are irrigated and 9,628 are upland. 
The irrigated and rainfed areas are general y planted twice a year. 
The estimated normal annual production of the province is 1,200,000 
cavans of palav. The averaere normal vi^lds are SO cavans fo-** 
the irrigated, 30 cavans for the rainfed, 25 cavans for the second 
crop, and 20 cavans for upland. The impoitant varieties grown 
are Quezon rice, Ramay, Binohangin, Raminad Strain 4, Elon-olon, 
and Kinalamba for the lowland irrigated; Binohangin, Elon-Elon, 
Raminad Strain 4 Apostol, and Naglihim for the lowland unirri - 
gated; Mangasa, Pinursimie, Balibod, Binohangin, Kinarice, and 
Apostol for the upland. The Quezon rice, although of recent intro- 
duction, has become popular in the irrigated districts. In a recent 
trial at the farm of Mr. Arsenio Escodero in Tiaong, this variety 
gave a yield of 74 cavans ner hectare. 

The' Janagdong irrigation system was constructed during the 
Japanese Occupation in Sariaya. It is capable of irrigating 300 
hectares * 

CORN. Corn is not planted in large scale, it being planted 
only with upland rice and as a secondary crop in some municipal- 
ities after upland rice in October and November. Some 2,000 hec- 
tares are planted to it, the most common varieties grown being the 
white and the yellow flint. 

SUGAR CANE. Sugar cane is a minor crop in the province. 
Less than 1,000 hectares are planted to this crop in small patches 
for local consumption. In some municipalities, the making of "pa- 
kaskas" and "panocha" is being practised. The most common va- 
l Continued < n 16]

riety being planted is the purple type. 

TOBACCO. Tobacco is another minor crop in the province 
and like sugar cane, it is j?rown in small patches in new clearings 
for local consumption. Planting- generally takes place in Novem- 
ber and December. Less than 200 hectares are planted to ft in 
the province, the most common varieties being Ir.espada and Pam- 
pano. 

ROOT CROPS. The fcrowinf? of root c~or>s is vo- v cnrvmo- 
among the farmers. In a*l sect ; ons of the province root crops of 
all kinds are grown in small patches or in commercial scale as in 
the case of cassava. Tne growing of cassava, camote, gabi and 
other root crops brought wealth to the farmers of the province 
especially in Lucban, Sariaya and Ca»-delaria during the Japanese 
occupation. During that time about 10,000 hectares were planted 
to these crops. Variety "Binulak" (cassava) which has a good 
eatm* and^cooking quality is the most popularly grown. 

FRUITS. The possibilities of fiu't grow'ng are bright. We 
nave a variety of climatic conditions su'tabl- for tho growing 
ot tropical and sub-temperate fruits. The mild climate of Luc- 
can, fcanaya and Tayabas is good for the planting of durian, 
rnangosteen lanzones, etc. In the lower regions, avocado, caimi- 

tne different varieties of c'trus bear fruits abundantly. S:nce 
I™ ° rgan ' za ^° n of the agricultural extens* on service in the lat- 
pVanted tGnS ° f thousands of thc se fruit trees have been 

n™JL?? F m? AND CA CAO. Coffee and Ca-ao are grown in the 
clcZ fl Thei !, aro approximately 400,000 coffee trees and 150,000 
ptn^iaiifr • ln ^ he P rovi ^ce. Coffee is plant-d in plantation scale

This souvenir brochure of the 1947 Quezon Provincial Carnival and 
Exposition is published not only to perpetuate the memories of the ten 
glorious days and nights during which all Quezonians pooled their re- 
sources together to carry out a noble purpose", but also to bequeath to 
posterity a document of lasting interest replete with historical facts and 
figures of Quezon province — from the early explorations of the Spa- 
niards in the sixteenth century to the present era of independence and 
reconstruction. 

The list of government officials and employees is virtually a provin- 
cial directory of public servants during the first years of the Republic. 

The editors lay no claim for originality in this work. All articles 
published herein are acknowledged contributions of various provincial 
and municipal officials who readily sent their manuscripts in lengthy 
forms. The editors, however, felt constrained to condense them due to 
space limitation. 

To Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon, who graciously furnished the interest- 
nig facts on the early history of Baler, the editors are gratefully indebt- 
ed; to each and every contributor and to everyone who lent a hand in the 
preparation of this souvenir book goes our most sincere thanks.

Another undeveloped forest product is almaciga or Manila 
copal. Before the war Infanta used to produce commercial quan- 
tities of this product for export. Its principal use is for the 
well-known copal varnish for carriages, automobiles, and other line 

W0AK MINING. There is a possibility that the mining industry 
may become an important industry in the province Deposits 
of gold, silver and other metals have been discovered in nearly 
all municipalities except Lucena, Tayabas and Candelaria. Rec- 
ords oi t^e Hegister oi Deeds ol the province show rninrn^ claims 
totaling more than 8,000 covering an area of over 131,00U hec- 

OTHER INDUSTRIES. Another industry worth mentioning 
is the nipa roof making. This is generally done in Infanta, 

Atimonan, Mauban, Lucena, Lopez, Pagbilao and in other Peaces 
where nipa abounds. This is not a new industry and the opening 
of roads in these municipalities pave the way for increased pi o- 
duction as the product finds readv market in other municipah- 

tlGS * DESICCATED COCONUT FACTORIES. Before the w: r 
there were four desiccated coconut factories in the province witJi 
a combined capacity of from 290,000 to 320,000 nuts daily and 
employing more than 1,000 laborers. At present there are only 
two factories in operation, one in T*aong, Blue Bar, and anotner 
in Candelaria, Peter Paul. The Red V Coconut Products at 
Dupay, Lucena is still constructing its factory. 

BANKING „ . - 0 

It was during the year 1919 when the Lucena B ranch ol the 
Philippine National Bank was inaugurated. Slowly but with stea- 
M Iu. c u ..po cue iirancii has won the confidence of the com- 
munity. Its field of operation extended throughout the province oi 
Quezon, San Pablo City, Alaminos, Calauang, Pila and Sta. Cruz in 
the province of Laguna and the municipality of San Juan, province 
of Batangas. , 

Ever since the opening of this Branch, it has extended eveiy 
possible financial assistance to deserving proprietors and business- 
men, small and big alike. It has served directly and indirectly the 
common "tao". The growth of the Branch can be gleaned over oy 
the fact that in the first few years of its operation it had only a 
total investment of hundreds of thousands of pesos but now its m- 
f vestments have increased to over a nvll'on and a half. This shows 
that the Branch has earned the goodwill of the people, taking into 
. consideration the fact that its deposits have reached over three mil- 
lion pesos and a half. 

Immediately after liberation when the Branch was reopened, it 
has rendered financial assistance to rehabilitate the farm and busi- 
ness activities, which had been prostrated due to the war. Now the 
province of Quezon, which is better known as the premier coconut 
region, is attain enjoying postwar prosperity. The price of copra is 
going up and our small producers as well as businessmen aie once 
more witnessing an unprecedented boom. It would be well, however, to 
serve notice that this boom, like all others, will not last for long. 
'At this juncture, it is both comforting and reassuring to know that 
the Philippine National Bank, which stands as the bulwark of fi- 
nancial progress, will always be ready to support and serve the peo- 
ple. 

In the province of Quezon alone the existing balances of loans 
by the agency as of January 31, 1947, are as follows: 

1. Time Loans Agriculture ! P184,228.36 

2. Time Loans Commercial 577.80 

3. Past Due Notes — 215.28 

4. Special crop Loans - Palay — — 148,429.15

NEW QUEZON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL 

LUCENA, QUEZON 



The Quezon Provincial Hospital was formally opened to the public on January 2, 1.925 with 
Dr. G. Santos Cuyngan as its head. 

On December 12, 1041 the hospital under the late Dr. Jose Recto Mayo was forced to trans- 
fer its site to Tayabas, Quezon because of the danger which Lucena offered as a possible battle- 
ground between the Japanese army and the retreating USAFFE. On September 7, .1942. 
the hospital was again transferred to Lucena, using the' building of the Quezon Provincial HijrH 
School, because the former building in Tayabas was converted into a Japanese Hospital. 

The Hospital was transferred to its old site on May 8, 1045 under acting chief Dr. Nicanor 
Hidalgo and on February 8, 1946 Dr. Faustino Sarinas, became the chief of the hospital up to 
September 20, 1946. 

The hospital has an official capacity of 80 beds, with 10 beds in the pay ward. However, 
since the liberation it has been operating on no Jess than 100 bed capacity basis. 

During the years 1945-1946 a total of 3,865 patients were admitted aside from the dispensary 
patients numbering 22,595. The average cost for operation and maintenance of the hospital is 
1*110,500.00. 

The hospital under Dr. Francisco L. Vicuna is fast improving the different services in the 
institution. An X-Ray service is now being installed and complete laboratory facilities will be set 
i p very soon. Since liberation dental service has been offered to dispensary patients. 

The Hospital will transfer its facilities to a new and bigger building along the Tayabas road 
it the near future. Repair and completion of the building is now going on. 

The Tayabas Provincial Hospital was named Quezon Memorial Hospital as per Resolution 
N'n. 98, dated 15 January 1047, of the Hon. Provincial Board of Quezon Province.

Lucena. His early services as a 
provincial official in different ca-

The town is known far and 
wide. Perez Park and Dalahican 
Beach attract tourists everywhere. 
Fate has spared this town from 
the devastat ; on of war. Most of its 
fine bu'ldings are still intact; and 
out of the ruins in the commercial 
district fine and modern buildings 
are rising like mushrooms. Lucena 
is destined to be a great metropo-

MUNICIPALITY OF AURORA 




Mr. Nemesio Jorquia 
Mayor of Aurora 

In ti-e yeiv 1814, Juan de Tor- 
res, Manuel Cuyo and Gregorio 
Palacio founded a village at the 
site where the present town of 
Aurora is located. It was named 
Bondo. This village or "visita" 
was o^ifHnally composed of the si- 
tios of Maayas-as, Mayabok, Mav- 
camnana and Kulinqr. Until July 
1 1938, with the exception of a 
short period of two years (1898- 



1890) when the Revolutionary Gov- 
ernment made it a separate mu- 
nicipality, this visita was under 
the municipal jurisdiction of Mu- 
lanay. On that' date, and after an 
unexpected visit of the late Pres- 
ident Manuel L. Quezon, Bondo 
was made an independent munici- 
pality and its territorial jurisdic- 
tion enlarged. To honor the then 
First Lady of the Philippines, the 
municipality adopted the name 
AURORA. 

The reg'on around Bondo (Au- 
rora) has been known to have mi- 
neral oil and during the early 
years of American administration 
m the Islands. Mr. Jo'm D. Rocke- 
feller, Sr., had caused oil wells to 
be dug there. He abandoned the 
Project, however, and the Philip- 
pine Government just before the 
outbreak of World' War II caused 
a survey to determine the possibi- 
lities of oil development in the 
Bondoc Peninsula.

MUNICIPALITY 
ATIMONAN 



OF 



The name Atimonan is a con- 
traction of the words "Ate Mo- 
nang." (The prefix is a title of 
respect or of affinity in Taga- 
log.) 

There was a legend that during 
the eaily yea~s of t' e 17th cen- 
tury in the village where the pre- 
sent town of At*'monan is now, 
there was a woman greatlv res- 
ected by the people whom the vil- 
lagers called "Ate Monang." 
When the Spaniards were organ- 
izing the village into a munic- 
ipality in 1608, the people spoke 
of ard pointed to their leader, 
Ate Monang. Thinking it was 
the name of t s .e village, the Span- 
iards adopted it as the name of 
the new township, and appointed 
Francisco Mangaba, brother of 
Ate Mo-ang, as the first Cap'tan 
Piunicipal. The Spaniards, how- 
ever, unable to pronounce "Ate 
Monang" as the Ta^alogs do, 
named the town "Atemonan." T ; itte 
has mellowed the word into " Ati- 
monan, " 'di it is now used. 

The Japanese used Atimonan as 
one of their invas'on points in 
December, 19*1, overcame the 
small USAFFE oatrol, and bat- 
tled their way to Manila. Dur- 
ing the liberation campaign the 
town, being a Japanese camp, was 
reduced to ashes by American air 
forces.

MUNICIPALITY CF PALER 



Baler will go down . in history 
as a typical Filipino town from 
where one of the world's greatest 
defenders of democracy had his 
humble beginning-. As historians 
delve more deeply into the study 
of the early life of the late Pres- 
ident Manuel L. Quezon, this town 
will present itself a shrine for 
researchers, students, writers, bio- 
graphers and countless admirers 
of the "Star" whose rise into the 
firmament of world politics is in- 
variably linked with his country's 
fight for freedom and democracy. 
Baler's history would be incom- 
plete without mention of Quezon's 
sterling qualities, his indomitable 
character, his stalwart personality 
like the town's massive mountains 
that for centuries have lifted, high 
their heads amongst the clouds. 

Baler's original name was "Ba- 

lid" and its early inhabitants 

many of whom were Negritos and 
Aetas— spoke the Balid dialect, 
which was the common language 
in the region from time immemo- 
rial to the close of the nineteenth 
century. Old folks of Baler still 
remember come words in the Ba- 
lid dialect. 

The early Spanish settlers, ex- 
periencing the difficulty of pro- 
nouncing "Balid,- changed the 
town's name into an euphonious 

one — Baler. 

The first settlement, which bur- 
geoned into a progressive village, 
was located in a barrio east of 
the present town site. The vil- 
lage history was recorded in the 

n**tta de la> Iplesia, which until 
lately was kept in the convent at 

Baler. The prosperous settlement, 
according to the Minuta, suffered 
a grcpt catastrophe with the com- 
ing of a big flood which swept 
away entirely the whole village. 
The flood was: caused by a "trom- 
ba marina" or "ipo-ipo sa dagat" 
— a sort of tidal wave which oc- 
curred one midnight. The story 
of that cataclysm has been told 
and retold frann generation to ge- 
neration. It was, said that the 



fleeing inhabitants who sought 
refuge in the mountain sides could 
see their village being washed 
away by the flowing current, 
while hens and roosters perching 
atop the houses mournfully crow- 
ed good-bvG to their masters. 

First to di corn the coming of 
the "tromba marina" was the pa- 
rish priest who immediately took 
av/ay the "santisimo" from the 
church and fled with it to the 
mountains. 

Relics of that disastrous pheno- 
menon are still extant to this day. 
Ancient plates, bowls and earthen 
utensils used by the villagers can 
be excavated by any casual ob- 
server at no great effort. Sur- 
vivors of that flood settled in 
what is now known as the pobla- 
cion of Baler. The place where 
the lost village stood has been 
named bv the survivors and their 
descendants Kinagunasan, a con- 
traction of the Tagalog word "da- 
kong kinagunawan" or the place 
that suffered the deluge. 

Until 1902 when the town of 
Baler was ceded to Tayabaa, it 

had been referred to as the Dis- 
trito de Principe. Which before 
then was a part of Nueva Ecija. 
In this district was the "coman- 
dancia" or the residence of the co- 
mandante politico militar. 

Today the inhabitants of Ba- 
ler believe it to be God's will that 
their town has been spared from 
any calamity after the flood at 
Kinagunasan. The Japanese oc- 
cupation had practically done no 
damage to the town. The bombs 
that fell in Baler during the early 
days of the war failed to accom- 
plish the evil designs of the in- 
vaders. 

Visitors in Baler are not only 
impressed by the town's peace and 
quiet but also by many girls — 
cultured, beautiful and fine.

MUNICIPALITY OF CALAUAG 



The early inhabitants of Pinag- 
bayanan together with those from 
Apad were the first settlers of 
Calauag. They were the Parcero 
and Siazon families. This was 
during the sixteenth century. 

With the coming of the Spa- 
niards in the year 156o, the first 
"capitan" or gobernadorcillo who 
was appointed by them was Juan 
Parcero. He was said to be a just, 
impartial, and wise leader. He was 
loved and supported by the inha- 
bitants of both groups, (the Pi- 
nagbayanan group and the Apad 
group) and was responsible for 
the organization of this town. 

The town of Calauag suffered 
much during the Japanese occu- 
pation. It became a bloody battle- 
field in the early days of hostili- 
ties. 

Today Calauag is emerging pro- 
gressively from the ruins of the 
last war.

^Municipal Gf/ici<tls <S~ G> mployees 



of Laguimanoc, which until then 
was a barrio of Atimonan, became 
a municipality. Ten years there- 
after the town's council sponsored 
the change of name, and support- 
ed by then Representative Leon 
G. Guinto, the municipality's name 
was changed to Padre Burgos. 

Port Laguimanoc in the early 
days offered a good wharf for 
vessels plying between southern 
Luzon and' Manila. This was also 
a port of call for ships exporting 
lumber to Europe during the Spa- 
nish regime. In this town was 
the residence of the Alcalde del 
Ma- — 



r or port officer. 



In the morning while the soft 
effulgent beams of the rising sun 
flood the landlock bay with silver 
light, Port Laguimanoc appears 
in glorious splendor like an ocean 
of liquid silver dotted by couples 
of emerald islands and flanked 
beyond by the majestic figure of 
Mt. Banahaw silhouetted against 
the blue. 

The town's topography is beau- 
tiful. Given the modern facili- 
ties of water system, electricity 
and good roads the municipality 
promises to be a prosperous town 
and an ideal vacation resort.

TT If TP 




Sampaloc is an inland town 
sprawLng on the slope of Sierra 
Madre muntains overlooking the 
blue Pacific. 

The early settlers of this town 
were roving tribes of Dingin, now 
a barrio of this municipality. 
About the second half of the eigh- 
teenth century the tribes confined 
i ei L set tlement near the bank 
of Maapon River that flows to 
tne sitio of Dingin. 
. T1 \ e settlers suffered frequent 
inundations while the river over- 
flowed its banks. The villagers 
being superstitious and believers 
an taa£ *f tlkba1 ^ brought

Because of constant Moro raids, 
tne settlers moved farther inland 
carrying with them an image of 
Christ at the Cross, which they 
saved from their burning settle- 
ment. On reaching the place 
where the present town of Saria- 
ya is located, the image suddenly 
became so heavy that the settlers 
decided to stay there and founded 
a settlement. Thus the present 
town of Sariaya was born. 

Before the outbreak of World 
War II, .Sariaya was the pride 
of the province of Tayabas (now 
Quezon) because of its fine, pa- 
latial homes. Of all municipali- 
ties in the province Sariaya is 
known to be the richest, and 
has the greatest number of well- 
to-do residents. It is indeed the 
Park Avenue of Quezon.

permanent plant or trees (coco- 
nut trees). 

Immediately pjtter the liberation 
of the Philippines, the TACO- 
PLANT resumed its activities and 
through radiograms made repre- 
sentations with the then Presi- 
dent Osmena and Resident Com- 
missioner Romulo at Washington, 
D.C. to t':e end that the coconut 
, people might be extended a just 
and equitable treatment. 

The TACOPLANT took a direct 
and active part through formal 
representations with President 
Roxas in the revision of the so- 
called copia agreement, and as a 
result of which, together with the 
removal of price control by Pres- 
ident Truman, the price of copra 
became more reasonable and has 
steadily gone up. 

The original officers of the As- 
sociation were: Dr. G. N. Agra- 
mon, President; Atty. Vicente 



Constantino, Sec.-Treas.; Hon. N. 
A. Enriquez, Dr. Cesar Reyes and 
Atty. Tomas Umali, members of 
the Board of Directors. In 1946 
to the same Board members were 
added Gov. H. R. Yanza and Mr. 
Raymundo Kagahastian. As re- 
cently reorganized on February 
25, 1947, t :e ^resent officers of 
the Association are as follows: 
Atty. Vicente Constantino, Pres- 
ident; Mayor H. Abadilla, Vice- 
President; Mrs. Victoria Winkle- 
man, Treasurer; Atty. M. V. Ag- 
caoili, Secretary Mr. Manuel Lo- 
pez, Dr. Generoso Nadres, Atty. 
Rufino Rodriguez, Jr., Dr. Ramon 
Soler, members of the Board of 
Directors. 

Dr. G. N. Agramon, the first 
President of the Association, and 
its president up to Feb. 25, 1947, is 
now the President of the National 
organization, the Philippine Coco- 
nut Association, Inc.

MUNICIPALITY OF UNISAN 



Unisan is reputed to be the old- 
er,^ town in Quezon. Its original 
name was Kali lay an, a derivation 
fiom the Tag-aloe: word "Lilay," 
a kind of palm similar to buri. 
This plant grew abundantly in 
the village, hence the name "Ka- 
li lay an." The town was the first 
settlement in the province and vir- 
tually the first capital. Later 
the town's name was the name 
given to the whole province. 

History records that this town 
was founded as early as 1591 by 
the _ first Malayan settlers. In 
1775 Kalilayan was made a visi- 
ta or dependency of Pitogo. A 
century later, on February 18, 
1876, the respective gobernadorci- 
llos of Atimonan, Gumaca and Pi- 
togo held an assembly in Kalila- 
yan and there created the now 
municipality of Unisan. 

There were different versions 
as to how the town's name was 
changed to Unisan. The most po- 
pular however, — and considered 
authentic by local historians — was 
the euphonious corruption of the 
Spanish word Unidos or Union. 

A local government under the 
erstwhile Philippine Republic was 
organized in 1898 with Vicente To- 
Icntino as the Municipal Presi- 
dent. In 1903 this town was 



again annexed to Pitogo. Not un- 
til Jauary 1, 1909 was Unisan 
again declared an independent 
municipality.
