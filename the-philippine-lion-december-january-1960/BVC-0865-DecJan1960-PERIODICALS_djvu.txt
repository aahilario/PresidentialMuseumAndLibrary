WHAT CHRISTMAS MEANS TO MY FELLOW-LIONS 



By 

Lion OLIMPIO L. VILLACORTA 

International Relations Officer 
Lions International 
Past President, Manila Lions Club 




This year’s Christmas finds Philippine Lions again in the vortex 
of activities in giving Christmas cheer to the needy and forlorn. The 
beautiful tradition of gift-giving and contributing to the happiness of 
others by preferring and sharing what they have with the distressed and 
the needy is ingrained in the Christian blood of Philippine Lions. A little 
tear for the unfortunate, a word of comfort for the afflicted, a line or 
two for the lonely and abandoned, a prayer of forgiveness for the wicked, 
a little solace for the embittered, care and loving tenderness for the in- 
nocent children — all these put only good thoughts in our minds, elevat- 
ing and sanctifying our Christian character, attuning it in perfect harmony 
with that of the Great Redeemer — the epitome of human perfection, 
whose infant smile gladdened the heart of Mary that first Christmas morn 



As architects of the Lionism move- 
ment in the Philippines and as workers 
in the field of the humanities, Lions 
come under those influences of heart 
and mind most conducive to human 
culture. And yet we, Philippine Lions, 
are often dismayed at the realization 
that the most terrible of human con- 
flicts have been fought by the most 
educated, the most efficiently trained, 
the ones capable of the sublimest 
ideals. Why the paradox? Will it 
suffice to say that the explanation 
is to be found in the fact that man’s 
scientific, technological and cultural 
advances have not been accompanied 
with a commensurate sublimation of his 
heart and spirit? Or need we confess 
that humanity’s failure in this regard 
is in proportion to its stupid departure 
from the trail, marked with homely 
truths, blazed by that Teacher who was 
born on the first Christmas Eve? 

Scratch off the Christian and “Lion- 
ism” in us and our world turns cen- 
turies back to the barbaric era when 
men lived on the miseries of their 
victims, when all that was worth any- 
thing was what one kept rather than 
gave, when the dead were remembered 
for the property they left rather 
than the joy and sunshine they radiat- 
ed. The eye-for-an-eye doctrine is a 
vestige of savagery and deserves no 
principles in modern Christian and 
Lionistic Jiving. 

Christmas, the greatest and happiest 
festival of the year, is essentially a 
religious institution to Philippine Lions. 



Christ, the Son of God, who became 
Man, born of the Blessed Virgin Mary 
in the holy town of Bethlehem. It is 
the fulfillment of the Divine Promise 
of the Salvation of humanity; the 
Christian idea of the Immortal Babe 
renewing weary, stained, and seeming- 
ly-lost humanity. 

Christmas as a microcosm of the 
w oi Ids leligions is an immense river 
of hope and light into which have 
owe tiibutaries from every side, 
from Oriental religion, from Greek and 
Roman civilization, from Celtic, Teu- 
tonic and pre-medieval society, all 
mingling their waters so that it is 
hard to discover the main far-away 
springs. Although the manner of its 
celebration is decidedly pagan and 
senn-atheistic in origin, it is on this 

y °.f. days that spiritual nature 
ot Philippine Lions becomes susceptible 
o yearning, craving, praying, giving, 
and remembering. Tingling, active 
kindliness pervades their souls and 
their hearts become fountainheads of 
contagious joy and hope. 

Today the world labors beneath the 
shadow of another universal cataclysm 
that threatens to wipe out the best 
vestiges of man’s achievements, and 
Philippine Lions must have an abound- 
ing faith in the value of “Lionism” as 
a vital tool in the improvement of 
community living-. We, Philippine 
Lions, have everything to do with 
living a Christian and “Lionistic” life,

MESSAGE 

It is a feeling of pride that the CAP AMP ANGA!\ LIONS 
CLUB belongs to the East Central Luzon Reg. on which holds its 
Regional meeting at the New Aristocrat Restaurant in Quezon City on 
February 4. 

This is another milestone in the history of Lionism in the Philip 
pines and affords us an opportunity to renew acquaintances and 
meet new friends and gives us the occasion to rededicate ourselves 
to the promotion of the lofty ideals and objectives of Lionism with 
its creed oj service.

President , CAP AMP AN GAN LIONS CLUB 
and Zone Chairman , Zone / 



0O0 




This East Central Luzon regional convention brings us togethei 
again for a reassessment of what we and. Lionism have done so far 
in this part of our country and for a renewal of our determination 
to do better in the years to come. 

If this convention cannot make as more Lions than we are, (better 
Lions , that is) with much deeper awareness of responsibilities inherent 
in being one with thousands of others in the same International 01 gan 
ization , bent in making this world a better place to live in, then we 
cannot be anything else much more worthwhile without it. 

Lionism has become , as it were , native in the I hilippines, not 
simply because it has won a name that inspires respect and admira- 
tion, but because it is performing a role for which Lionism was 
conceived by its founders and because of which it has rallied able and active civic-minded men to Us 
colors and principles an appreciation of misery, misfortune and human pain and a determination to alle 

viale them wherever and whenever it van. ( g g j > FEL1C lSIMO ANICETO

MALABON 

The Malabon Lions Club in its paramount desire to 
serve the town of Malabon and its constituents has taken 
unto itself the gigantic task of sponsoring the founding 
of a plaza worthy of the town’s name. 

The plaza consisting of a playground, a band stand, 
a pavilion, and a combined public library-community center. 
Lions den is located behind the conspicuous Municipal Town 
Hall of Malabon and by the side of the navigable Malabon- 
Navotas river occupying a land area of about one and a 
half hectares. Construction of the project has long begun 
and at present it is three-fourth finished, admittedly under 
the able and efficient supervision of Engineer Angel Lazaro, 
Jr. and Architect Ricardo Crisostomo, both Lions. The 
whole project when completed will cost about P 120,000.00. 
The fund for this ambitious project came from the con- 
tributions of civic minded citizens of Malabon, from civic 
and religious organizations, from the members of the Ma- 
labon Lions Club and from the Provincial Government of 
Rizal as well as from the Municipal Government of Malabon. 

This entire project when finished will give the people 
of Malabon, in all walks of life, a healthier place for re- 
laxation and also will undoubtedly help contribute immense- 
y to the cuting down of juvenile delinquency.

second successful year. 

CABANATUAN

ers’ Day, Governor Legaspi bared the 
rapid progress of the Philippines in 
the field of Lionism since he assumed 
office as District Governor almost 2 
years ago. 

Governor Lally disclosed that from 
50 clubs in 1958 when he was elected 
District Governor, District 301 has 74 
clubs now, all in good standing. 

The increase in the number of clubs, 
he said has inevitably led to the divi- 



sion of the District into two — Dis- 
trict 301-A which will comprise the 
more than 50 clubs in Luzon and Dis- 
trict 301-B which will comprise the 
clubs in the Visayas, Mindanao, and 
Jolo. 

The division will be consummated when 
Disttrict 301 meets for the last time at 
the District Convention to be held in 
Legaspi City on May 20 to May 22. 
Each District will then elect each own 
District Governor while the entire Phil- 
ippines will elect only ONE member of 
the Board of International Relations 
and nominate one candidate for In- 
ternational Director. 

Governor Legaspi also intimated that 
District 301-A may even be divided 
into two Districts as each district is

guided by faith in God and love for our 
fellowmen. Club activities have gone 
beyond the usual and the ordinary 
and have expanded in scope, purpose, 
and direction. 

In marking the gaiety of this festive 
season, let us pledge ourselves, with 
renewed dedication, to making further 
contributions in the fields of human 
progTess — socially, culturally and 
economically — in fellowship, national 
affairs, international peace, amity and 
understanding, and other fields of 
service endeavour. In this manner, 
our lightheartedness at Christmas will 
be clean, sober and worshipful.

and a most prosperous and happy 
New Year! 



only required to have 20 clubs. This 
may materialize, in all probably in one 
or two more years. 

Meanwhile, Governor Legaspi is en- 
joining all clubs to send their delegates 
in full to the coming convention as it 
will be the last convention of District 
301. List of delegates of each club 
should be sent to the District head- 
quarters as early as possible so reser- 
vations for accommodation could be 
arranged with the Legaspi Lions Club, 
the host club. 

Host book will cost P 40.00 for each 
Lion and P 20.00 for each lady. This 
does not include hotel accommodations 
and transportation. 



TOMAS GOMEZ 

DEPUTY DISTRICT GOVERNOR 
East Central Luzon Region 

President Tomas Gomez of the Calooean Lions Club, concurrently 
Deputy District Governor of the East Central Luzon Region, is a young 
man of no mean ability — in business, as an executive and in Lionism, as 
one of its almost 'fanatical adherents. 

Born in December 21, 1917 at Bacoor, Cavite, this young Caviteno 
graduated at the University of the Philippines College of Law in 1941 
and passed the bar the same year. 

Mustered into the USAFFE at the outbreak of the last World War 
as an officer, Atty. Gomez participated in the infamous Death March where 
thousands perished. He was held prisoner in the Capas Concentration Camp 
where he “graduated” with honors upon his release. A hero in his own 
right, Deputy District Governor Gomez never faltered in his ambition to 
realize his dreams. Fired with a grim determination to succeed in life, 
the indefatigable worker that he is, founded the Yellow Freight Lines, 
Inc. and became it. president and general manager. This is now one 
of the most progressive freight lines in the country. Not content with 

his success in this line of endeavor, however, he branched out to another 
venture and founded the Yellow Trading Company, Inc. becoming it. pres- 
ident. Both ventures now gross along six figures, combined. 

Imbued with the spirit of civic responsibility nurtured in his heart 
as a result of his business successes, and des.rous of sharing these 
successes with his fellowmen, the young energetic man with robust ideas 
became one of the founders of what is now known as the Calooean Lions 
Club, a civic organization dedicated to community service, and became 
one of it charter members. 

For his continued distinguished service to Lionism for 10 yeai s, Lion 
Tom was awarded a Charter Monarch Chevron and Certificate by Lions 
International. 

The members of the Calooean Lions Club, seeing in him a potential 
civic leader, elected him to the highest position in his club for two terms 
1958-59 and 1959-60. 

District Governor Lally Legaspi, himself a two-term governor of Dis- 
trict 301, appointed Lion Tom Deputy District Governor for East Central 
Luzon comprising seven clubs this year, a position he has been carrying 
with zest and enthusiasm seldom seen in a man with less vitality and vigor. 

Under Deputy District Governor Tomas Gomez, a succesful business 
executive, an attorney, and above all, an energetic and great civic leader, 
the East Central Luzon Region is on the road to success.

Reports 



No. 14 

My dear fellow Lions: 

This Newsletter started last year as 
a bi-monthly report. Now it has be- 
come a weekly affair. I wish I can 
make it oftener so that you will read 
more of what the District Office is 
trying to do, what the other clubs are 
trying to do. 

FIRST 

My apologies to all those whose let- 
ters I have not yet answered. I re- 
ceive about twenty letters everyday and 
much as I would like to answer them 
all at once, I really find it very dif- 
ficult to have enough time to answer 
them promptly. I could, of course 
write one or two lines in reply, which 
probably is the correct thing to do. 
I could ask my secretary to answer 
the letters and for me just to sign 
the letters — as I do in my business 
— but somehow I do not think this 
is the nice thing to do. 

But just the same, my apologies — 
and my sincerest thanks to all of you 
who have written to me. 

And now for ’the rest — 

Over in Osaka, Japan, last year, the 
Lions created a committee with the 
name of “Lubang Repatriation Com- 
mittee. ,, Its purpose was and is to 
help bring out the two Japanese strag- 
glers in Lubang, Mindoro, tell them 
that the War is over and all and 
sundry are now “Tomadachis”’. Mr. 
Nokoro Yamamoto arrived last Novem- 
ber 5 to help in this undertaking. 
Previous to his arrival, I received a 
telegram and several letters from Osa- 
ka Lions. The Osaka Lions are also 
shipping 2,000 shirts for distribution 
to the people of Lubang. The shirts 
will carry the emblem of the Lion. 
The Osaka Lions also requested me 
to make it appear that these are gifts 
from District 301 and not from the 
Japanese. A very thoughtful gesture, 
of course. 

But these shirts are the gifts of the 
Japanese Lions, particularly of the 
Lions of Osaka. District 301 will be 
very happy to help distribute them to 
the people of Lubang, Mindoro. 

International Relations Officer, Dr. 
Olimpio (‘‘Speedy”) Villacorta, past 
cabinet treasurer, past president of 
the Manila Lions Club, and a Lion 
definitely with a future, arrived from 
a world tour a few days ago. Yes, 
he was accompanied by Mrs. Villacorta. 

Somebody asked me why we call the 



good, handsome doctor ‘‘speedy”. All 
I can say: it was Past President George 
Bagtas (of the San Carlos Lions) who 
baptized Impiong with this name after 
one of our “visitations” in Cebu. 

Our October Reports are coming in 
a little bit faster now. I am happy 
to note that Tumauini and Ilagan are 
now among the first to submit their 
reports. What do I do with these re- 
ports? Here is my letter about the 
second batch of reports for October: — 
“November 6, 1959 
“Mr. Justin B. Snyder 
Supervisor, Service Section 
Lions International 
209 North Michigan Avenue 
Chicago 1, Illinois, U.S.A. 

“My dear Justin: 

‘‘Enclosed are more reports for 
the month of October. These are 
in addition to the 33 reports I mailed 
to you on November 5: 



1. Atimonan 

2. Bayanihan 

3. Binalonan 

4. Caloocan 

5. Catbalogan 

6. Ilagan 

7. Marikina 



8. Natividad 

9. Northern Cebu 

10. Rosales 

11. Surigao 

12. Tayug 

13. Tumauini 



“When the reports for October 
shall all be in your hands, and 
you go over them, you will notice 
that your membership increase for 
the October drive will not be any- 
where near our figure for last year. 

“This year, as you probably re- 
collect from some of our conver- 
sations in New York, our goal is 
quality membership. It is so nice 
to see an impressive Roster of 
membership — but it is definitely 
more gratifying to have a Roster 
of Lions and feel that each and 

everyone of them is a man this 

organization can be proud of. And 
I am proud of our present mem- 
bership. 

“For as you say, Lionism is some- 
thing in the Philippines. I would 
also like to feel that I, too, can 

contribute my bit to continue to 
keep it so. I expect difficulties, 
especially in the collection of dues' 
I expect a lot of people to g e t 

angry, but as our friend Wil wrote 
me once, a firm stand will in the 
“long run bring result and res- 
pect.” 

‘‘Sorry, if I preach. But this i s 
more to myself than to anyhodv 
else. The temptation to remain 
popular and well liked is very great 



— and when one talks about dues 
and financial obligations one gets 
into trouble. I can now fully sym- 
pathize with our mutual friend Wil 
when he wrote in the same letter 
that his “insisting on financial mat- 
ters being handled fairly and pro- 
perly has made many individuals 
angry back through the years. . 

“But to business — don't expect 
too much for November. It is open 
season for politics right now. Best 
regards. 

Sincerely, 

EULALIO F. LEGASPI 
Governor-District 301”

No. 16 

My fellow Lions: 

From Harry J. Cooper, Director of 
Public Relations, Lions International, 
came a brochure entitled “We Serve". 
It is a small pamphlet giving some 
vital information about our Associa- 
tion. A few quotations: — 

From Clarence L. Sturm, President, 
Lions International: 

“In a world where millions of people 
still go to bed hungry each night, the 
help of the Lions is needed more than 
ever before. Through community 
services, they continue to help those 
less fortunate than themselves, thus 
contributing toward a better world and 
a lasting understanding among men 
and nations.” 

And from the pamphlet itself: — 

“The members of Lions Clubs are 
selected from the community’s leading 
and professional men, industrialists, 
clergymen, educators, merchants and 
others. They are pledged to help 
through Lionism those less fortunate 
themselves. Lionism is non-sectarian, 



yet it encourages religious observance 
and church loyalties. It is non-poli- 
tical, yet it inculcates a lively interest 
in governmental and civic affairs.” 
“The purpose of a Lions club is 
to determine community needs and 
develop means of meeting them, either 
through its own efforts or in coopera- 
tion with other agencies. . . At the 
same time. Lions Clubs provided good 
fellowship and club social life for their 
members.” 

“There are ten suggested classifica- 
tions for major activities which Lions 
Clubs may adopt — 

“Agriculture 
‘“Boys and Girls 
“Citizenship and Patriotism 
“Civic Improvement 
“Community Betterment 
“Education 

‘‘Health and Welfare 
“Safety 

“Sight Conservation and Work for 
the Visually Handicapped. 

“United Nations 

“Members of each club are expected 
to attend meetings regularly and to 
take an active part in all club com- 
munity service activities. Lionism 
brings together leading men in the 
community to put the golden rule into 
practice. While good fellowship is one 
of the important assets of Lions Club 
membership, it is the joy of working 
together with fellow members in cons- 
tructive worthwhile causes that gives 
the greatest satisfaction to members.” 
‘‘Lions are known and esteemed 
throughout the world for the number 
and importance of their activities.” 
Also the same pamphlet mentions the 
following activities undertaken and 
completed — and still being under- 
taken — by the Lions Clubs through- 
out the world: 

1. Maintenance of health clinics 

2. Sponsorship of community cen- 
ters, parks, children’s amusement 
equipment, wading pools, field houses, 
and swimming pools. 

3. Maintenance of orphanages, chil- 
dren’s hospitals, and children’s camps. 

4. Promotion of programs of en- 
tertainment and education for the youth 
to prevent juvenile delinquency. Pro- 
motion and sponsorship of Boy Scout 
and Girl Scout Troops, YMCA’s and 
YWCA's, Boys’ Clubs, 4-H Clubs, 
School Bands, and other youth organ- 
izations. 

5. Support campaigns or major re- 
search organizations, providing funds 
for buildings, equipping hospitals and 
clinics, purchasing ambulances and 
hospital beds, paying for medical treat- 
ment and surgery in needy cases, or- 
ganizing visiting nurse programs, tak- 
ing part in immunizations and vaccina- 



tions, etc. 

6. Cooperation with safety programs. 

7. Support United Nations. 

All these, and many others, neces- 
sary to make this world a better place 
to live in, have been done and will 
continue to be done by the Lions Clubs. 

And somewhere in the pamphlet, in 
the enumeration of the Lions Code of 
Ethics, the following are printed in 
bold letters: 

1. Faith 

2. Ethics 

3. Loyalty 

4. Success 

5. Friendship, and 

6. Obligations 

And, finally, also in the pamphlet: 
“The Lions emblem consists of a 
gold letter “L” on a circular purple 
field. Bordering this is a circular 
gold area with two conventionalized 
lion profiles at either side facing 
away from the center. The words 
“Lion” appear at the top and “In- 
ternational” at the bottom. The 
emblem represents a lion facing 
both past and future — proud of 
the past and confident of the future.” 
And so that little pin means all 
these and more — to give its wearer 
that pride of things gone by and 
confidence in things to come in the 
“Lions” way — 

With my best regards, 

Very sincerely yours, 

EULALIO F. LEGASPI 
Governor-District 301

My fellow Lions, 

With the elections over and things 
going back to normal, the visitation 
of our Lions Clubs will once more 
be on its merry way. 

Last year, November was the “peak” 
month for visitations, with a 20-day 
visitation of 12 Visayan clubs, extend- 
ing over 5,000 kilometers of contin- 
uous travel by air, by sea, and on land. 
This month, because of the elections, 
so far only two visitations were made: 
Obando, on the 20th, and Mandalu- 
yong, Bayanihan, and Capitol (in a 
Zone meeting) on the 21st. Manda- 
luyong acquired a new member on 
the 21st. Provincial Governor Isidro 
Rodriguez of Rizal was inducted as a 
member of the Mandaluyong Lions 
Club. 

Last year, I thought I could 
arrange some sort of travel and time- 
saving schedule of visitations, avoid- 
ing criss-crossing the country, and 
scheduling a visitation section by sec- 
tion. I found that it just cannot be 
done. So again, for November and 
December, I will be in the Bicol Pen-

Caloocan Lions were bled! Don’t be alarmed, folks. This is just one 
of the worthy projects of the Caloocan Lions Club led by President Tom

office of Caloocan President Tom Gomez, who was their genial host of the 
evening. Presided over by President Pisiong Aniceto, fourth from right,

Manila, proceed to Baguio, back to 
Manila, enplane for Zamboanga and 
Jolo, back to Manila, then again to 
Pangasinan — probably covering over 
5,000 kilometers and over 20 contin-

if you survive, as they say. 

The following is my schedule for 
the rest of November and up to Dec-

dan Lions Club, Pangasinan, Charter 
Presentation. 

I am also requesting all District and 
club officers who have the time to 
spare to accompany me in my visita- 
tions. This will be a fine opportunity 
for them to see our clubs, and be seen 
by the clubs. Especially so, for those 
who are aspiring for the District Gov- 
ernorship for the next fiscal year. 

As I wrote before, the District of- 
fice has submitted all the necessary 
papers to Lions International for the 
proposed Re-Districting of District 301 
into two Districts. The final decision 
is with Lions International. In the 
event that a division is approved, we 
will probably have either of these two 
divisions: 



(a) Based on geography: — 

1 . Luzon — consisting of 
about 50 clubs; and 

2. Visayas, Mindanao, and 
Sulu — consisting of about 
23 clubs; 



or 

(b) Based on the number of clubs: 

1. North and Central Luzon 
— consisting of about 40 
clubs; and 

2 , South Luzon, Visayas, Min-

danao and Sulu — con- 
sisting* of about 33 clubs. 

In the event of such a division, we 
will have two District Governors next 
year. Our convention in Legaspi, sche- 
duled for May 20 to May 22, will thus 
elect the following: 

2 District Governors 

1 International Relations Officer, and 

1 Nominee for International Direc- 
tor. 

as well as choose the next convention 
site. In the event that the division 
not approved, we will go on as we 
have been going for the last ten years, 
and wait for developments next year. 

It will, of course, be rather tough 
on the next District Governor. He 
will probably have about 75 clubs. 
Just to visit each and every club — 
as is required of him — will take 
over 200 days of travel, and some 
30,000 kms. It is precisely for this 
reason that I am inviting all District 
officers and others to join me in some 
of my visitations. They will then have 
an idea as to what will be expected 
and required of them when they be- 
come District Governors. 

But, as I have always said, it is 
a nice life. Full of fun and sur- 
prises. Full of fellowship. Of course, 
there are frustrations now and then, 
but these are like salt to make sugar 
sweeter. 

Just a reminder to our tail twisters. 
Take it easy on the fines. Even if 
prearranged, have mercy. Excessive 
fining will kill attendance. Above all, 
do not fine or ask contribution from 
visiting Lions. 

In our second convocation of Pres- 
idents, Treasurers, and Secretaries, 
held in August, 1959, a Resolution 
was approved prohibiting clubs from 
fining, asking, or accepting any money 
from any Lion visitor or District of- 
ficer. Should such a fine be im- 
posed for fun (the usual excuse given), 
the visiting Lion may pay the fine. But, 
the club will pay back to him twice 
the amount of whatever he pays, half 
to go back to him, and the other half 
to be turned over to his home club. 

And especially this Christmas season, 
take it very easy on the fines. 

With my best regards. 

Very sincerely yours, 

EULALIO F. LEGASPI

My fellow Lions, 

It is unfortunate that the Parana- 
que Lions Club circularized their let- 
ter of November 12, 1959. I have 
been approached by several officers 



and Lions to correct certain impres- 
sions which may be created by that 
letter. 

The following is my reply to the 
letter of Paranaque, which brings out 
certain facts not apparent from the 
letter of Paranaque:

LIONISM: WE SAIL ON! 



The following is the address of Lion Gen. Basilio J. V aides delivered before the 
Manila Lions Club last January 27 at the regular luncheon meeting of the club dedicated 
to the Founders' Day in observance' of the birthday of Melvin Jones, founder and Secretary- 
General for life of Lions International and in honor of the club's charter members. Be- 
cause of the substance and significance of this address, the Philippine Lion is proud to 
publish it in full for the benefit of all the Philippine Lions in District 301. Lion Basil 
was conferred the honorary membership for life by the Manila Lions Club in recognition 
of his great and distinguished services to Lionism. He was formerly an active Manila 
Lion and one of the club's charter members. — Ed. 



Lion President Guevara, 

Fellow Lions and Friends: 

I feel greatly honored for your spontaneous and sincere 
friendship and comradeship, and I want to thank our Lion 
President and the other distinguished officers of our club 
for honoring me with an honorary membership to this mag- 
nificent club. Nothing gives a man, trying to achieve an 
important objective, greater pleasure than the thought 
that he is not alone in his efforts. The going might be 
rough and without any material reward but all these are 
of little importance when you know that there are other 
men, more important than you, who share with you the 
toil, the hardships and disappoinments in the pursuit of a 
common goal. 

During the years that I have 
been a member of the Manila 
Lions Club, I have always felt 
happy to see it grow bigger 
and better. I am proud of our 
Club. I am proud of it not only 
because I sincerely believe in its 
objectives and its principles; I 
am proud of it only because I 
believe it is the kind of rallying 
bastion we need to combat com- 
munism and lack of interest in 
the community in which we live, 
but because it is one organization 
where one finds friendly coope- 
ration and enthusiastic teamwork. 

It is one organization where you 
find dependable citizens with real 
devotion to duty, who give all 
they have so that the Club might 
realize its objectives in behalf 
of the community as a whole. 

The Manila Lions Club has 
carried to a successful comple- 
tion many worthy projects from 
the giving of gifts to poor fa- 
milies in Christmas to the build- 
ing of public shelters for people waiting for a bus or other 
public vehicles. But in my humble opinion, the most excellent 
programs carried out have been the installation of the mo- 
nument of Governor Simon de Anda y Salazar at Bo- 
nifacio Drive and the valuable assistance given to Mayor 
Lacson in the construction of our modern Botanical and 
Zoological Garden at Harrison Park. Simon de Anda y 
Salazar was the most pro-Filipino Spanish governor we 
had during the Spanish regime, and for this reason he was 
greatly hated by the Spanish Friars, who opposed his ad- 
ministration vigorously. 

With reference to the new Botanical and Zoological 
Garden, I have heard with pleasure very favorable com- 
ments by foreigners. The distinguished wife of the Ger- 
man Ambassador told me that we can be proud of it, 




Gen. BASILIO J. VALDES 



because it is just as good, if not better, than many others 
she has seen in other parts of the world. 

It is said that the present is built upon the past 
and that what is achieved today determines what we can 
expect of the future. If this is true, then we can all 
hope for greater achievements of our Manila Lions Club. 

I joined the Manila Lions Club at the invitation of 
my good friend and distinguished citizen, the then Lion 
President Paquito Ortigas. I saw the Club grow from a 
handful of enthusiastic organizers to a robust Club com- 
posed of members who have distinguished themselves in 
their respective careers and lines of endeavor. All our Lion 
Presidents from the unforgettable Lion Paquito Ortigas to 
our own Lion Domingo Guevara, as well as the members 

of their respective boards of di- 
rectors have endeared themselves 
to us by their untiring efforts 
in behalf of the community as a 
whole. Through their valuable 
work they have proven they are 
men of vision, that powerful in- 
gredient for successful leadership. 
Vision plays a very important 
iole in every phase of useful 
human endeavor — from the har- 
monious functioning of the home 
to the wise administration of im- 
portant community projects. The 
gift of vision is a most important 
asset and when you add the 
coinage to act, it becomes a 
winning combination.

bined to foster the spirit of Lionism. Fellowship is res- 
ponsibility of all members of the various Lions Clubs, and 
like a beautiful and fragrant flower, it must be carefully 
cultivated and gently nurtured. There can not be goo 
fellowship unless it is backed by a close and understand- 
ing friendship, and that is precisely what Lionism does 
. . . it enlarges our circle of friends. Foi in t e on £ 01 
and struggle of life, in the constant quest for happiness 
and achievement, the richest rewards always go to those 
who can make and keep good friends. Foi ^ en L 16 
is fruitful and beautiful. I will say with Hugh Black, 
the famous writer, that to the young, fuen s ip comes 
as the glory of spring, a very miracle of beauty, a mys ery 
of birth. To the old it has the bloom of autumn, beau- 
tiful still. A friend once won is never lost. In the bus e 
of business and accidents of life, fiiends m ‘*- v 0 '~ e S .F 

of each other for long periods of time but when they 
meet again they find that the warmth of their friendship 
has not cooled off. The importance of friendship in the 
progressive education and development o men ca 
•underestimated. It brings forth everything that is good 

in planning and in our mutual efforts for service to he 
community in which we live; for the light of friendship is like 
the light of phosphorus, seen best when all around is dai . 

Another "quaiity which is important in the development 

of good fellowshin is “loyalty”. Loyalty is t ^ 

practical and thoroughgoing devotion of »P° ,b0 ^ 

cause. A man is loyal when first, he has some cause^to 

which he is loyal; when, . se “£ dl £ ® ^nd when thirdly, 
roughly devotes himself to ^ 

he expresses his d< »»*» » » « Tsev^ of Ms cause. In-

all over the world. Today Lions International counts with 
more than thirteen thousand clubs and more than half a 
million members. What is the reason for this huge suc- 
cess? It is because Lionism has endeavored to establish 
a stronger bond of friendship between nations and a closer 
brotherhood among men of different nationalities, of dif- 
ferent religions, and different races. Lionism is striving 
to teach men to learn to live together in harmony and 
peace in this beautiful world of ours. Lionism teaches us 
to believe in people and banish hate, fear and misunder- 
standing, so that all the Lions in the world working to- 
gether may attain what diplomats have utterly failed to 
attain ... a world brotherhood of men and eternal peace. 

The biography of Christopher Columbus tells us that 
on his history-making perilous voyage across the uncharted 
North Atlantic Ocean, he kept a private daily log which 
revealed his spirits, his quiet hope, and at times his blind 
despair. One day a heavy storm tossed the Santa Maria, 
the Pinta and the Nina, his three small shins about like 
small corks on the water. The strong winds and high 
waves damaged all his ships and caused one of them, the 
Pinta, to lose her rudder. And on that disturbing, de- 
solate day, his crews threatened mutiny, and boldly told 
Columbus that if he did not give immediate orders to 
turn back, they would throw him overboard. Perhaps we 
will never know what gave Columbus sufficient courage 
to stand against his threatening and mutinous crews in 
the face of imminent dangers and the uncertainties of an 
uncharted sea. All we know is that at the end of that 
hectic day, he wrote in his daily log, this brief report: 
“This day we sailed on”. 

It was indomitable courage and sheer determination 
that inspired Columbus to be able to continue to sail 
on in the direction which his intuition and logical intel- 
ligence led him to believe was the right course. The 
inspiring words of the great navigator have encouraged 
countless leaders from all walks of life to maintain their 
faith and increase their determination to attain their noble 
goals in the face of utter despair and discouragement. 

In a calm sea, any sailor can be a good captain. But 
the real test of a good pilot or successful leader comes 
when the storms rage, the waves lash, and the strong winds 
blow. It is equally true in every individual’s personal life. 
It is during the bitter experiences, the heart-breaking 
failures, the sad disappointments, the sleepless nights, the 
echo of prayers unanswered that we as captains of our 
own fates and pilots of our own souls must calmly strive 
to put our faith into action in order to be able to record 
on our own personal cnart: “This day we sailed on”. 

The life of every man is a diary in which he means 
to write one story, but writes another. And his humblest 
hour is when he compares the volume as it is with what 
he hoped to make it. The best story of our life is told 
not in writing, but in deeds, not in statistics but in ef- 
fective community service. And as we reach the snowy 
winter of our life from which there is no more return to 
Spring, we can look back in retrospect with the poignant 
awareness of our mistakes, but conscious of the fact that 
through our inspiration, enthusiasm, understanding and 
efficient leadership we have enriched the lives of other 
people in our respective communities and made life for 
them worth living for. 

Henry Ford, the automobile magnate once wrote: 
‘‘Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is 
progress; working together is success.” My message to 
you today is. Continue working together without rest in 
the fulfillmen of Lionism’s noble objectives and always 
remember the words of Jesus: 

“For they shall be known by their works”.

Governor Reports . . . 

(Continued from page 17) 

“Dear President Tolentino, 

“This will acknowledge receipt of 
your letter of November 14.. 1959, 
together with its enclosures. 

“In compliance with your request, 
in your letter of November 12 to 
our International President, I have 
forwarded to him copies of your 
monthly and Activities Reports so 
far submitted for the current Lions 
Fiscal Year. It is not for me, at 
this time, to discuss the various 
matters brought up in your letter, 
but I would merely like to point 
out to you. since obviously you seem 
to be unaware of certain facts, 
through no fault of yours because 
you recently assumed your position, 
as the elected President was a Ma- 
yoralty candidate that: 

“1. Your club has not regularly 
met all your District and Interna- 
tional obligations. “International 
dues are payable in advance: On July 
1 for the first semester of the Lions 
Fiscal Year, and on January 1, of 
the second semester of the Fiscal 
Year. Our current fiscal year is 
July 1, 1959 to June 30, 1960. 

“2. All matters affecting your 
club, have been the subject of dis- 
cussion and possible solution between 
your Secretary and myself. 

‘‘3. Please allow me to correct 
your impression that all I am in- 
terested in is in the collection of 
dues. Yes. I am “obsessed”, if you 
want to use the word, with the col- 
lection of dues, and what is more 
important also “obsessed” with all 
the things that make a good or- 
ganization. 

“4. You mentioned your club 
house project — you will remem- 
ber that I, too, was proud of that 
project, contributing a modest 
amount of P 200.00 towards the 
completion of that project some- 
time last December. 

“5. I do not think that you and 
I disagree on the real points at 
issue: 

“(1) That International and 
District dues shall be paid: and 

“(2) That club dues must 
likewise be paid by your mem- 
bers; 

“(3) That while such pay- 
ments are not necessarily the cri- 
teria of “excellence” of a club, 
to the exclusion of all others, 
they are nevertheless necessary 
for the continued membership of 
your club and your individual 
members in this Association. 

“6. You wrote about your club 
house project. It is good and it is 



fine — for your members. But, 
if you will glance over your month- 
ly activities reports, you will find 
on the matter of “Activities” — 



“July, 1959 None 

“August, 1959 Induction 

“September, 1959 .... None 



“7. Since basically, you and I 
are agreed (as your letter to our 
International President would indi- 
cate) concerning the necessity of 
paying your Internaional and Dis- 
trict Dues; that action should be 
taken against a member who deli- 
berately refuses to pay his dues; 
and that, although this may sur- 
prise you a little, I am interested 
and eager to have your club res- 
tored to its former active status, 
may I suggest that your club: 

“(l)Pay 'its International iand 
District dues for the first semester 
of the current fiscal year, that is, 
from July 1 to December 31, 1959 
as follows: 

“1. International dues — $220.00 
or P 440.00 (listed as “over 90 
days due” in the September Fin- 
ancial Recapitulation of Lions In- 
ternational) ; 

“2. District dues P240.00 

(or P3.00 per capita for each 
of your 80 members) 

“You will be pleasantly surprised 
that as soon as your club paid the 
above, it will be very easy for all 
of us to work out a solution on the 
other “problems” that temporarily 
appear to be “differencies” between 
your club and the District office. 
It is not, as you may again misun- 
derstand, that I consider payment of 
dues the only criterion, but your ex- 
perience and mine have shown that 
once the “touchy” subject of un- 
paid accounts has been satisfacto- 
rily settled, solutions to all other 
problems follow smoothly. 

“And you will also be surprised 
that if your officers and members 
(excluding you officers and mem- 
bers who have been delinquent for 
many years) will just allow us in 
the District Office to work with 
them now, it will not take a long 
time to restor your club to its 
former ‘‘active” status. 

Very sincerely yours, 

EULALIO F. LEGASPI 
Governor-District 301 

“cc : 

Lions International 
President Clarence L. Sturm 
Director-General R. Roy Keaton 
Wilburn L. Wilson, Treasurer 
Justin B. Snyder, Supervisor, 
Service Section” 

The District Office will never inter 
fere with club officers. That is, as i on „ 



as the club functions properly. When 
it fails to do so, as when a good per- 
centage of its officers and members 
owe back dues for two or three years, 
when the club has no activities, when 
its officers fail to exercise their duties, 
when the members complain about mis- 
management, etc., then the District Of- 
fice will submit to Lions International 
a recommendation to have that club 
placed on “status quo”. A club on 
“status quo” has not lost its charter- — 
yet. But it may, if corrective measures 
are not taken. 

With my best regards. 

Very sincerely yours, 

EULALIO F. LEGASPI

If you prefer, pick up any mem- 
ber of your club (preferably one 

who has been fairly regular in his 
attendance). Let him answer the 
questionnaire, and request him to 

mail the questionnaire directly to the 
District Office. All questionnaires 
returned will be treated as “top 
secret”. No reference will ever be 
made to any particular questionnaire 
of any particular club. 

The results — as a whole — how- 
ever will provide interesting study 
on how to improve the entire Dis- 
trict.

And, in addition, why don’t your 
club have questionnaire mimeograph- 
ed, distributed to all members for 
them to answer? Then you will 
know how your club is rated by 
your own members. 

My best regards, 

Very sincerely yours,

My dear Fellow Lions: 

The last week-end found me and 
my party (Special Representative 
George Barrenengoa, International Re- 
lations Officer Olimpio L. Villacorta, 
Cabinet Treasurer Dominador Tiosejo. 
and Club Presidents Rod Manzano of 
Mandaluyong and Felicisimo Aniceto 
of Obando) covering over 1,300 kilo- 
meters of travel. 

We started in the early morning of 
Saturday, November 28, taking the 
train for Legaspi City, where we ar- 
rived at 7:00 o’clock in the evening. 
A board meeting in the home of De- 
puty District Governor Cesar Duran, 
followed by a club meeting at the 
Mayon Hotel, then off to Locsin (Le- 
gaspi President Francisco Senora ve- 
hemently insists that it should be 
called Daraga) where George, Pisiong, 
and I passed the night in the home 
of Lion and Mrs. Ramon Ohate. 

Sunday noon, November 29, found 
us in Sorsogon (a new club) with the 
Legaspi Lions headed by Deputy Gov- 
ernor Cesar Duran, Legaspi President 
Francisco Senora, Zone Chairman Fer- 
nando Velasco, Lions Ohate, Los Ba- 
nos, and others. A warm welcome, 
a delightful lunch, and a very won- 
derful meeting with the Lions of Sor- 
sogon under President Dr. Fernando 
Duran, then merienda with Dr. Fer- 
nando Duran. At 4:00 P.M. we pro- 
ceeded to Naga City under a moderate 
to heavy rains. We arrived in Naga 
City at about 7:00 o’clock in the 
evening to find the city under a 
black-out. With candle-light and ke- 
rosene lamps, our meeting at the 
New China Restaurant lasted until 
about 9:30 P.M. In the evening, we 
slept in the home of Club President 
and Mrs. Floro Dabu. 

Breakfast, then off by train from 
Naga City to Manila, where we ar- 
rived at half past nine in the even- 
ing of November 30, two hours behind 
schedule. 

Somewhere in Quezon Province, we 
thought that our train could not pass 
through, as the waters of the sea had 
overflown nearly to the railroad trails. 
But we got through. 

Tomorrow, at 6:10 A.M., I am start- 
ing my itinerary which will cover 26 



clubs, and, except for a few days in£2 
Manila to allow me to spend the* : 
Christmas season with my family, will., "* 
cover the period up to January 24, ( ' 
1960, and approximately 7,000 kilo- 
meters by air, sea, and on land. 

Reports for November of 29 clubs 
have been received as of December 2. 
May I request the other clubs to rush 
their reports? And will the clubs now 
prepare for the Second Semester’s In- 
ternational and District dues? 

A new club has just been added to 
District 301 — the Lions Club of 

Guimba, Nueva Ecija. 

This is also the last opportunity for 
all Zone Chairmen to hold their Zone 
Advisory Meetings scheduled for the 
First Semester. Do not forget to 
send your Reports of these Advisory 
meetings. 

Also a reminder that our Annual 
District Convention is definitely sche- 
duled for May 20, 21, and 22, 1960 
at Legaspi City. You will receive 
further particulars from General Con- 
vention Chairman Cesar Duran. Hos- 
pitality booklets will cost P 40.00 for 
each Lion delegate and P 20.00 for his 
lady. Hotel accommodations will be 
given on a first reserve, first deposit 
only for registered paying delegate 
and paying lady. All requests for in- 
formation, all reservations, etc. should 
be sent to Legaspi Lions Club. 

Final plans for the Convention will 
be discussed and approved on Decem- 
ber 20, in a meeting of the various 
Committee Chairmen at my place in 
Quezon City. 

Only clubs duly certified by Lions 
International and the District Office as 
having paid their International and 
District dues at least one month before 
the Convention may be allowed to have 
voting delegate in the Convention. This 
is in accordance with the Lions Intel - 
national and District Constitution and 
By-Laws. 

‘ February 1 to 8 will be the visitation 
of First Vice-President and Mrs. Finis 
Davis. 

Well, so long — for now, and with 
best wishes and an early Christmas 
greetings to all of you, your ladies, 
and your families. May we all have 
peace on earth and goodwill to all. 

Very sincerely yours, 

EULALIO F. LEGASPI

My dear Fellow Lions: 

Have just completed a visitation of 
the Lions Clubs of Iloilo City, Mt. 
Kanlaon, Occ. Negros, and San Carlos. 

We arrived at about 10 o’clock in 
the morning of December 3rd in Ilo- 



ilo City, to be met by Lions of Iloilo 
City headed by Zone Chairman Fritz 
Loring, Past Deputy District Governor 
and Member of the Governor’s Ad- 
visory Committee, Mario Guariha, and 
Past International Relations Officer 
Dely de Leon. From the airport 
we proceeded (Special Representative 
George Barrenengoa and myself) to 
the home of Dely de Leon where we 
had a luncheon meeting with the of- 
ficers of the Iloilo City Lions Club. 
Attending this meeting were also De- 
puty District Governor Paquito Rojas, 
Public Relations Officer Marcial Ga- 
leon, Secretary Jesus Amnil of the 
Occidental Negros Lions Club, and 
some other visitors from other clubs. 
In the evening we had a meeting of 
the Iloilo Lions under the sponsorship 
of a committee headed by Lion Fran- 
cisco “Pax” Ascalon. It was a very 
interesting meeting. In fact it was 
an eye-opener, the way Lion “Pax” 
Ascalon managed the evening’s affair. 
There were some contests and prizes 
and George Barrenengoa won a pair 
of Rhode Island layers. George want- 
ed to donate the prize back to the 
club, but he was informed that the 
winners during evening’s contest must 
take their prizes home. George pro- 
mised to send the 2 chickens by air- 
freight to Manila. My congratulations 
to you Lion Francisco “Pax” Ascalon 
and to your other committee members: 
ions ‘Sebio” Villanueva, “Virgilio” 
Ferraris “Periong” Blancaflor, and 
“Paquit” Hortillas. 

The noon of the following day, Dec

where the Lions of Mt. Kanlaon and 
Occidental Negros, headed by Interna- 
tional Counsellor and Chairman of the 

nandr> n0 “M Com ™ttee, Fer-

to center on the special ‘‘De-Worming” 
one-man project of Deputy District 
Governor “Paquito” Rojas. He felt, 
in line with the theory of George, 
that the only way to eliminate worms 
from our individual systems was to 
fill us with alcohol. The following 
noon, Sunday, we had lunch with Lion 
and Mrs. Ramirez of the Mt. Kanlaon 
Lions Club where we had a most un- 
usual variety of excellent sea foods 
served to us. Our only regret was 
that we had to stop eating when we 
did because of physical impossibility 
to continue. All of our party sent 
their thanks to Lion and Mrs. Ramirez 
of Mt. Kanlaon. Incidentally, Lion 
Ramirez is the Caltex Manager for 
Bacolod. Now I know why Caltex 
gasoline enjoys good sales in the Phil- 
ippines. At about 2 o’clock our party, 
loaded in 4 cars, and increased by the 
Presence of “Ely” Ongsingco of the 
Occidental Negros Lions Club, Zone 
Chairman “Pedring” Arroyo, Lion Ra- 
mirez of the Mt. Kanlaon Lions Club, 
Lion ‘‘Nene” Alunan of Occidental Ne- 
gros, together with our original group 
of “Paquito” Rojas, “Dading” Bernar- 
do, George Barrenengoa, Dr. Speedy 
“Olie” Villacorta, Dr. Jesus Ampil, and 
myself, proceeded on our way to San 
Carlos, approximately 150 kms. 
Bacolod City. Seventy five kms. of the 
load from Bacolod City to San Carlos 
is reasonably good but the rest of the 
'way is just a route only. Some 4 
hours later we arrived in San Carlos 
where we were met by San Cailos 
President ‘‘Tony” Ascona, Past Pies- 
ident and Past Public Relations Of- 
ficer “George” Bagtas, Immediate Past 
President Ingvar and other Lions of 
San Carlos. Two years ago when 1 
first visited the San Carlos Lions Club 
m the midst of a draught, I piomise 
them that it would rain on that par- 
ticular evening. And believe it 01 
not it rained. Jokingly, in the course 
°f our meeting I told them that iam 
Would accomuany me also during 
visitation of their club. We were hold- 
ing our meeting in an open space an 
in the course of the Induction 0 
new member to the San Cailos Lions 
Club, it began to rain and we had 0 
continue our meeting indoors. At 11 
o’clock we bade our good nights an 
good-byes and proceeded on oui way 
to Bacolod City in the midst of a 
heavy downpour. Except for one S P° 
in the road where our car bogged 
down in the mud, the five-houi live 
to Bacolod City was uneventful. A 
half nast 3 o’clock A.M. we were back 
at the Bascon Hotel. A luncheon af- 
fair given by “Ely” Ongsingco in Max s 
Place in Bacolod City, then coffee and 
another meeting in the Bascon ° 



where visitation of First Vice-President 
and Mrs. Finis Davis for Bacolod City 
was taken care of. At 5 :20 in the 
afternooon of December 7 we were 
once more on our way to Manila, where 
George and I arrived at half past 7 
in the evening. 

Our special thanks and appreciation 
to “Paquito” Rojas, Marcial Galeon, 
‘‘Ely” Ongsingco, “Charlie” Sibug, Je- 
sus Ampil, Lion Ramirez, Dely de 
Leon, Mario Guarina, “Nanding” Cuen- 
ca and all the fine Lions of Iloilo 
City, Occidental Negros, Mt. Kanlaon 
and San Carlos. It was wonderful to 
be with all of them. 

In the course of my visitation to 
these 4 clubs I was asked by one or 
2 members to give them some light 
about the Lions Club of Paranaque 
which was placed by Lions Interna- 
tional on “status quo” upon my re- 
commendation. In one of my News- 
letters I have published my reply to 
the letter of the Paranaque Lions with 
the request that, all things considered 
the only way to reactivate the club was 
for the club first, to pay its interna- 
tional and district dues for the first 
semester of this current fiscal year. 
Considering that the necessity for a 
club to comply with its obligation can 
never be over emphazised, I am quot- 
ing 2 letters, copies of which I had just 
received upon my arrival in Manila. 
These letters came from Supervisor 
Justin B. Snyder and Director-General 
R Roy Keaton. They are in answer 
to the letter of the Paranaque Lions 
Club copies of which have been cir- 
cularized by Paranaque to the clubs 
of District 301. Here are the letters: 
“December 1st, 1959 
"‘Mr. Ernesto A. Tolentino 
First Vice-President and 
Acting President 
15 Los Tamaraws Drive 
Paranaque, Rizal, Philippines 
“Dear Lion Tolentino: 

“This will acknowledge receipt of 
the several sets of your letters and 
enclosures addressed to Internation- 
al president Clarence L. Sturm, 
with conies for the Administrative 
Officers at this address. 

“There appears to have been some 
possible question, so may I also con- 
firm that the contents of my tele- 
of October 28th, to District 
Governor Eulalio P. Legaspi, were 
exactly as quoted following the se- 
cond paragraph of your letter of 
November 12th ... .. 

“Personally, I am indeed sorry if 
Governor Legaspi has received any 
contrary impression from any letter 
or conversation of mine. But I 
should point out that he and every 
othe r District Governor “shall be 



the representative of this Associa- 
tion in his district...” Also, “He 
shall act under the direction of the 
Board of Directors of this Associa- 
tion and shall have general super- 
vision of all clubs in his district . . . ” 
In other words, his authority does 
not emanate from this office, but 
from the International Board of 
Directors. 

“Each District Governor recog- 
nizes particular needs and goals he 
wishes to emphazise, and to a large 
degree each has his own personality 
and methods. When Governor Le- 
gaspi first assumed office, he was 
aware of certain organizational 
weaknesses and made it his object 
to concentrate upon their improve- 
ment. If in the process, he has 
‘‘touched off the sensibilities” of 
some Paranaque members, it is 
genuinely regrettable. But this is 
not a new matter, and the need 
for improvement in this area of 
club responsibilities was unques- 
tionably evident from past records 
for the District; it is evident from 
your own club financial statement 
of October 31st. Stated another 
way, he has been trying to get res- 
ponsible club officers to follow what 
are only sound procedures essen- 
tially necessary for any Lions Club, 
otherwise the club will not be in a 
position to be of service to anybody. 

“It is difficult to make a legal 
case of objection to personal “tenor 
and manner”. Governor Legaspi’s 
record, his incalculable sacrifices of 
his time, energy, and means, his 
risks of health and life itself in be- 
half of Philippine Lionism, place his 
intentions beyond question. 

‘‘Of course, I have referred your 
documents, the records and full in- 
formation to my immediate superior, 
Director-General R. Roy Keaton, for 
further action. Meanwhile, I sincere- 
ly hope that before it is necessary 
to carry through the legal meas- 
ures you request, and place such 
full information in the hands of the 
International Board of Directors, 
that you can and will reach agree- 
ment with your District Governor. 
The first step appears to be in 
compliance with suggestions in his 
letter of November 18th, which after 
all are only the reasonable and ne- 
cessary obligations of any and all 
Lions Clubs. 

“Sincerely yours, 

Justin B. Snyder 
Supervisor, Service Section 
Lions International

First Vice-President and 
Acting President
