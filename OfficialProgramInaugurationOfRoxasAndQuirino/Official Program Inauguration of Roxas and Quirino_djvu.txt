still living. 

He received his early education in the public schools. Then he was sent 
to Hongkong to study at St. Joseph's College for one year and later to Manila 
to complete his education. He attended the Manila High School, graduating 
in 1910. Choosinj? law, he entered the Law School opened by the Y MCA 
Here he studied for six months and then transferred to the University of the 
Philippines where he finished the law course with high honors in 191,3 In the 
same year, he passed the bar examination with the highest rating 

His first positions in the government service were modest The records 
show that in his student days, he acted as interpreter in the Court of First 
Instance in the Fifteenth Judicial District. After topping the bar examinatio^n 
in 1913, he attracted the attention of the then Chief Justice Av^ii^. a

employed as law clerk of that groat jurist. He resigned in 1917 to enter 
politics.

THE PRESIDENT 



Philippine Legislature. Again lie headed the House delegation which formed 
part of the Independence Mission of 1931. The year 1933 marked the climax of 
the long struggle in Washington. Roxas, Osmena, and others secured the pas- 
sage of the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Law. Though Quezon had this law replaced 
by the Tydings-McDuffic Act, he commended Roxas for his brilliant work. 
*'If any member of the mission," he said *'was most useful in the campaign 
in America, that member was Speaker Roxas." The resulting Pro and Anti 
struggle is still vivid in the political memory of the nation. True, Roxas 
lost the Speakership, but "he fell into the arms of the people.'^ He had 
qualified as a national leader to be reckoned with in every affair of state. 

In the Commonwealth era he was in every national planning enterprise. 
He served in most of the agencies created to study different aspects of the 
national life. He was a member of the Joint Preparatory Committee on 
Philippine Affairs, and he was chairman of the following bodies: The National 
Economic Council, the Tax Commission, the Rural Progress Administration, 
the Board of Directors of the National Development Company, and the 
Committee on Educational Policy to reorganize the University of the Philippines. 
He was a member of other government boards such as the National Rice and 
r rn Corporation the Mindanao Land Settlement Project, the National Relief 
R nrd and the Board of Regents of the University of the Philippines. In 1938 
was made Secretary of Finance, a position which he held until 1941 when 
he resigned to run for the Senate.

Senator-at-Large in 1941. Upon the liberation of the Philippines, he was 
elected President pro tempore of the Philippine Senate in 1945.

wealth Government, he was Chairman of the Joint Legislative Committee on 
Taxation; Senate Majority floor leader and Chairman of the Committees on 
Rules, Accounts, Elections and Privileges, and Public Instruction. He was a 
ranking member of the last Independence Mission to the United States headed 
by Manuel Quezon which secured the passage of the Tydings-McDuffie Inde-
