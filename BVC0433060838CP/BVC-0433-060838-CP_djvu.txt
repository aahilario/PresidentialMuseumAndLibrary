HE last session of.

sembly has en- 
couraged specula- 
tion concerning 
the position occu- 
pied by the legis- 
lative branch in 
the present set-up 

# 01 the Commonwealth Govern- 
ment The total absence of an op- 
position group in that body save 
for sporadic blocs and the one-man 
challenge which heavily punctuat- 
ed the session in the last hours has 
given rise to serious doubts of 
^ wh ether the National Assembly as 
r.ow established and constituted 
is an adequate answer to the re- 
f n remen ts of popular sovereignty. 

Charges of the one-chamber

Intense as it is today. 

Furthermore, the proximity of 
the elections has had a great deal 
to do with the attitude of the 
members of the last Assembly. 
Since the great majority of them 
were eager to be re-elected, it was 
to be expected that they should so 
act during the last days that they 
could' stand safe and sound before 
the electorate upon what can im- 

♦ mediately be known of their legis- 
lative record. 

All these circumstances add up 
to a situation that is pregnant 
. with debate. Assuming that the 
present position occupied by the 
National' Assembly in the set-up 
• of the Commonwealth Government 
leaves something to be desired, 
what possibilities for improve- 
ment, if any, are there? 

Perhaps, a legislature in which 
there are two political parties 
more or less evenly matched in 
strength would remedy in great 
part the defect we have assumed. 
For whatever may be said in criti- 
cism of a two-party system with its

interminable parlian entary de- 
bates and fiiibiL 5 leiing > there is no 
substitute lor the open and tho- 
rough discussion of public matters 
by two opposing political parties 
on the floor of a popular assembly. 

-K * * 

A GAIN, it is possible that the 
root of the trouble lies in 
some defect even more organic 
and fundamental than this . The 
comparative weakness of our pre- 
sent legislative body may be due 
to the fact that it is composed of 
a single chamber . It seems log- 
ical to suppose that a unicameral 



legislature is more easily subject 
to control and dictation from 
without than would a two-cham- 
bered body. 

Are the two-party system and 
bicameralism, then, the twin reme- 
dies of a political situation that 
most impartial obsei’vers believe 
far from what it ought to be? 
Two evenly matched political par- 
ties would make the thorough 
threshing out of public questions 
obligatory. A two-chambered leg- 
islature would make control and 
dictation from without much more 
difficult than it is today . 



Conceding that these remedies 
are available, and that they can 
effect the improvements indicat- 
ed, there would still remain the 
interesting question of whether 
then just ba 
these changes 



everything would 
right. For, all 
would mean no - more than a 
return to a status we have al- 
ready experienced with all* the old 
defects, that we already know. 

We would still have to face the 
problem of the individual member 
of the National Assembly wlu> is 
torn between loyalty to his duty 
and loyalty to his party, between 
the desire to be faithful to his con- 
science and his ambition to please 
his constituents. 

For, after all, when you come to 
think of it, the strength of a legis- 
lative body, or of any group what- 
ever, cannot be than the 

sum total of individual 

strengths of the that 

compose it. An aloft, self -confid- 
ent. find fu> r'.'t'i'f ti l /v.. *- i'wa.l 
sembly caw only hxisc where the 
\rvOLVV\dua\ members are alert, selt- 
cotifiderit, and powerful \t\ them- 
selves. And the members o£ the 
National Assembly cannot develop 
these qualities unless they have 
the opportunity to blossom out in 
freedom from pressure that can 
be applied on them any time. 

* ,-K * 

>T'HE remedy , as I see it, must 
f be sought beyond the mere 
forms of a two-party system 
and a. two-chambered legislature. 
Granting the importance of these, 
something would yet have to be 
done to strengthen the individual 
legislator, to nurture in him the 
spirit of true independence. 

There is no job more difficult, 
more bewildering, more exacting 
than that of a legislator. In a 
set-up such as we now have, it is 
practically impossible for him to 
have a mind of his own. He has 
to stifle his conscience and his in- 
telligence if he expects to do any- 
thing. He has frequently to yield 
to the pressure exerted by ele- 
ments often too powerful to be 
disregarded : by liis constituents 
who are selfishly interested only 














in what they can get out of the 
government, by interests that have 
th3 power to do him good or harm 
according as he agrees or refuses 
to be their tool, by groups that 
have the means to deaden his con- 
science with generous proofs of 
their gratitude, by his party that 
can withhold pork barrel and pa- 
tronage from him and thus ruin 
his chance at re-election, by his 
colleagues who will tempt him into 
joining with them in the approval 
of bills by logrolling, by the Admi- 



lustration that has so many ways 
of making reprisals on those that 
have fallen out of its favor. 

The poor legislator is thus hem- 
med in on all sides by forces 
which are not conducive to ho- 
nest discussion and intelligent 
voting, on top of the party disci- 
pline which he is boimd to obey, 
are innumerable other disciplines 
to which he is compelled to con- 
form. After being exposed for 
some time to these various influen- 
ces, the average legislator ceases 
to have even the barest sense of in- 
dividuality and independence. He 
becomes an unthinking and cons- 
cienceless cog in a vast political 
machine. He has ceased to be of 
any decent use to a self-respecting 
constituency. 

* * * 

rpHE idea, then, should be to sur- 
^ round the legislator with every 



How to protect the legislator 
against this? The suggestion that 
follows is not mine, but that of an 
American newspaperman who feels 
as I do that the present condition 
of legislators everywhere is piti- 
able. It will sound fantastic at 
first, but once you grasp the im- 
port of the whole proposition, you 
will begin to realize how sound and 
wise and practical it really is at 
bottom. 

The proposition, briefly, is this: 
Pension every legislator for life at 
his full salary. 

That will take out the fear of 
insecurity from his soul. Assured 
of an adequate and steady income 
as long as he lives, he can then 
take his seat among his peers in 
the National Assembly and face 
the world a proud and sincere 
man, genuinely the master of him- 
self and the keeper of his own con- 
science. 

How much would such a pen- 
sion system cost? Let the 
speak, for themse\ves.t>i\nety-e\ghx 

members of the National Assem- 
bly at an annual salary of P5,0Q0 
receive P480,000 a year. The 
average expectation of life of an 
assemblyman is probably 15 years. 
Barring re-elections, 98 new names 
would be added to the pension list 
every three fears, or a maximum 
of .P2, 400, 000 as total outlay for 
such a pension system. 

Re-elections would bring the 
figure of new additions to the pen- 
sion roll every three years to 
about 50, bringing the total 
amount needed for pensions down 



co but a little over a million pesos. 

-K * -K 

/CONSIDER furthermore, that it 
^ is part of the scheme to give 
the government the right to em- 
ploy an ex-assemblyman in some 
capacity for which he is fitted 
without compensation other than 
his pension. There is no question 
but that a former member of the 
National Assembly can be placed 
in some capacity where he can give 



The whole thing will make for * 
lot more decency in the 1 * 






the government the benefit of his 



experience. A considerable portion 
of the pension money would, 
therefore, be spent for positions 
on which the government must, in 
any case, spend money. This 
means more savings, bringing the. 
actual expense for such a system 
strictly for those that cannot thus 
he re-emvloyed down to about 
half a million pesos. 

You will say, that’s still a lot 
of money for a government with 
an annual budget of P80, 000,000. 

Wufc a.%a.Yt*. \\\e. o'Cnet ad- 

vantages and. savings, both nvota\ 
arid material. Shielded by his 
sense of personal security, the le- 
gislator has a chance at least to 
be honest and sincere. He is pro- 
tected from pressure and from 
temptation, especially the tempta- 
tion of wasting the people’s money 
in pork barrel lagislation, and the 
pressure to betray the people for 
the sake of special interests. 

He can give his party, his 
constituency, his colleagues, the. 
Administration, and this vested 
group or that a piece of his mind 
whenever he wishes to do so.

pOUR decades ago, the Amer- 
ican soldier laid aside the 

and the Remington, stopped 
chasing warlike bands of Filipinos 
who still defied the advent of Am- 
erica,, and started gathering pupils 
from among the children of the 
Philippine revolution. The sudden 
transformation of the newcomers, 
from fighters to teachers even 
while the embers of war were still 
alive in many parts of the country, 
did not suddenly transform the Fi- 
lipinos into warm friends of the 
Yankees. Instead, the Filipinos 
offered all kinds of obstructions 
and the soldiers turned teachers 
had a hard time gathering pupils 
to form classes in improvised build- 
ings. Using sign language and the 
utmost tact, offering even coins 
and gifts to the children just so 
they would enroll and learn the 
English language, these soldiers 
before the century had turned, had 
laid down the basis of Philippine 
public school system, which is pat-

dent on his southern trip.” 

We watched Mr. Salvador in- 
tently at work. His eyes were fix- 
ed on the paper before him and he 
read every word of every corres- 
pondence before affixing his signa- 
ture. He asked pointed questions 



as such, it developed in the Fili- 
pinos, who are Oriental in outlook, 
a practical western slant on life. 
It has made the Filipino both a 
dreamer and a deer 

It has trained him in democracy. 
It has improved his health and 
physique; An examination of the 
curriculum of the public schools 
readily reveals this ; and an ocu- 
lar observation of the pupils in 
our public sahoo.s amply supports 
this claim. 

“The Filipino is as he is today be- 
cause of the splendid public school 
system which we have,” he said. 
“I am sure nobody can successfully 
dispute this fact.. 

“I’m positive that the invest- 
ments of our people in the public 
school have not been in vain. The 
emphasis we have placed on it, by 
setting aside the larger part of our 
annual appropriations for the 
schools, are the surest index that 
we are an enlightened and pro- 
gressive race.

Public Education Is Groundwork 
Of American Experiment In P. I 



terned almost wholly after that of 
America. 

One such pupil of the early days 
of the public school system of the 
Philippines under American sol- 
diers, who was drafted to teach his 
countrymen almost immediately 
after he had learned the A. B. C. 
of the English language because of 
his extraordinary aptitude for ac- 
quiring education, is now at the 
head of the educational system of . 
the country. This man, who hails 
from Bicolandia and who, on the 
day his appointment was announc- 
ed by President Quezon, had com- 
pleted exactly 30 years, eight 
months, and eight days m 
the bureau of education, is none 
other than Celedomo Salvador. 
His appointment as head of the 
bureau, coming as it did one year 
and five months after he had been 
Homed assistant, director, had leu 
many to believe that his promotion 
jvas a sudden leap. 



By VICENTE L. DEL FIERRO 



“Many may think it that way,” 
he told us when we saw him last 
week, as he was busy going over 
many valuable school projects be- 
fore departing with President Que- 
zon on)a cruise of the southern is- 
lands. “But they forget, or they 
do not know, that 1 have three de- 



of the clerks as one after another, 
they took turns to have him sign 
letters and documents that have 
something to do with the efficient 
running of the public school ma- 
chinery, especially at the time of 
the opennig of the classes. 

As we watched him thus, the 
magnitude of the task before him 
dawned upon us. He is at the 
head of the government depen- 
dency with an outlay from the na- 
tional, municipal, and provincial 
governments of more than P25,- 
000,000 annually, just for school 
maintenance - and teachers’ sala- 
ries, exclusive of other several 
millions earmarked for buildings 
and grounds. Before us rose the 
vision of the 32,718 tireless and 
uncomplaining teachers imparting 
the benefits of education to 1,493,- 
338 pupils (as of December 31, 
1937) , in all parts of the country. 

In our mind’s eyes, we saw 
schoolhouses right at the foot of 
mountain clearings, as well as pu- 
pils going to school in buses in our 
cities; we saw teachers fording 
bridgeless rivulets going to class- 



and day advancing the frontier 
of knowledge and cementing the 
ties of unity that bind the Filipino, 
nation. * * * 

W7E were still thinking thus, 

W when Mr. Salvador again 
looked up at us and said: “Shoot!” 

“What,” we asked him, “do you 
consider the outstanding achieve- 
ments of the public school system 
implanted here by the Ameri- 
cans?” 

“Ah,” he said, “you have a large 
order. But I’ll answer you. 

“In the first place, let me state 
categorically that the public school 
system is the greatest monument 
of American adventure in the Phil- 
ippines. All the social, political, 
and economic progress that the Fi- 
lipino people have been able to 
achieve in the last forty years is 
largely and primarily the result of 
this splendid school system. 

“This school system has not only 
enabled the Filipinos to call them- 
selves one of the most highly edu- 
cated peoples of the world but has 
eradicated their provincialism, so- 
lidified their national unity, pro- 
moted their physical development, 



“It is indeed very laudable that 
under the Commonwealth contra- 
ry to the fears expressed in cer- 
tain quarters, there has been no 
diminution in. the outlay for the 
public schools. On the contrary, 
the appropriations have been in- 
creased steadily, commensurate 
with the growing- school popula- 
tion of the country.” 

* * * 

nnfHE FIRST Filipino director of 
A the bureau of education, which 
is the largest bureau of the nation- 
al government, believes that char- 
acter-building is the highest aim 
of education. He proudly pointed 
out that by and large, the 
Philippine public schools may be 
said to have inculcated character 
in the Filipino. To him, character 
makes for individual distinction 
and national greatness. 

He replied when asked as to Ms 
future plans: 

“There is plenty to do here. My 
predecessors have done an excel-.' 
lent job and I should do no less. 
It is my wish and hope that in time 
we shall be able to put all the 
children of school age in the class- 
rooms.” 

From the beginning of the sys- 



es; we saw them coming home, 
tired and hungry hut happy; we enriched their political life, and ad- tern up to the .present time, the 
saw them hv a flickering saslamn vanc.ed their economic, and social Filinino ueohiehaveaheadv scent.

The moon was already half-wa,y 
out of the outspreading roots of 
the giant balete tree. Magic sil- 
ver sparks of light seemed to melt 
from its huge, spreading branch- 
es. Teroy doubled his pace, then 
broke into a run. “Wait!.... 
wait! . . .” he was addressing the 
moon softly so that his mother 
would not hear, “I’m coming!” 

K * -x 

F OR many days he had watched 
the moon come out from the 
roots of the old balete. A few 
days ago it was very thin ; some- 
times it would not come out at all. 
He had asked his father why; he 
had received only a half -angry: 
“Don’t ask me foolish questions,

“Where’s the moon now?” 

The moon was hidden by the 
thick groves of paiasaiis. Teroy 
frantically searched for an opening 

and immediately found one a 

wild path, -perhaps made by forest- 
beasts in their nightly journeys to 
the brook. But he did not know 
that; he was too young to be 
afraid. 

“Suppose it is not there any 
more? Suppose it has flown up 
to the sky already? Yes. . . yes. . . 

I must hurry!” 

He was oblivious of the pain as 
the thorns of the thick palasans 
pierced his skin ; he could not hear 
the eerie murmurings of strange 
forest voices; he had only one 
idea — to see it, to touch it, to sa- 
tisfy an all-consuming curiosity! 

“J must hurry ,* 9 he panted,

Hurt, innocent eyes gazed de-

rpHE yellow gold of drooping 
A stalks of ripening palay- 
caihgin sparkled with the last re- 
flection of the setting sun. Slow- 
ly, darkness was beginning to fall, 
but Teroy did not stir. He sat 
there, alone, a little boy of six, 
fearless of the oncoming night 
with that instinctive adaptation to 
the wildernes common to those 
born and reared in the secluded 
forest which was his home. He 
adjusted his wide-brimmed hat, 
which was too big for him, so as 
not to obstruct his vision and fol- 
lowed the giant ball of red fire 
with his little eyes as it slowly 
sank below the horizon. “Very 
pretty,” he told himself, “but it 
must be very hot.” 

Teroy shifted his position on 
the big stump and turned about to 
the opposite direction. He smiled. 
“It will soon come out now,” he 
mumbled inaudibly. He was look- 
ing past the yellow stalks of pa- 
lay, past the deep gorge which se- 
parated the cultivated clearing 
from the thick forest nearby, fur- 
ther on toward a giant balete tree, 
from behind whose outspreading 
roots the moon was just beginning 
to peep. It was not .so far, per- 
haps not more than half a kilo- 
meter, but the difficulty of the 
descent from the clearing and the 
still harder task of penetrating 
into the thick foliage, mostly of 
thorny palasanas made the old 
balete seem inaccessible. But 
Teroy was not thinking of that. 

He was too young to know the 
meaning of danger, yet he was 
old enough to be curious. 

He rose and walked toward the 
moonrise. He heard his mother 
calling him, “Teroooy. . . Teroooy 
. . . but he pretended not to hear. 

» Tie looked back somewhat. guiitiVy 
toward the nipa house and. saw his 
mother coming down the stairs. 
“Terooooy. . . Where are you?” 

He crawled under the tall stalks 
of palay. “Inay must not see me 
now,” he was murmuring a prayer, 
“Plea.se, God, Inay must not see 
me now.” He reached the edge 
of the clearing and stood up. He 
was safe! Thick cogon grasses 
shielded him from his mother. 



haps it is like a firefly— a big fire- 
fly that does not twinkle. 

Thus, Teroy escaped from - 
borne because his father had gone 
to town... His mother will not tell, 
no, his mother will not tell. His 
mother loved him. 

“But what if Itay learns about 
this?” He thought of his father’s 
leather belt, thick and hard. 
ugh'. . . . Tie looked again at the 
peeping moon. “Never mind!” 

He began the perilous descent 
into the gorge. He felt his left 
arm itching a little and saw that 
the sharp stalks had scratched 
his tender skin. A little trickle of 
blood flowed from the superficial 
wound but he did not mind. Des- 
cending through the overhanging 
branches that lined the bank of the 
ravine, he gained the bottom, per-

Another July Is Coming 



By Jose A. Lansan g 



A N OTHER July is coming. In 
the cold countries, the month 
of July sees the last of the Spring 
days, stale postcripts to the lovely 
and rare days of June, the tender 
„;weethearting time of the Temper- 
ate Zone. Time there was in the 
not so long ago when most any- 
where in the world the advent of 
July was merely the advent of 
July. In America, for instance, 
and to a certain extent in the Phil- 
ippines and wherever Americans 
live, the coming of July meant 
nothing more ominous than inten- 
sified preparations for a fitting ce- 
lebration of the Glorious Fourth, 
the day when those that could af- 
ford it tear the heavens with high 
wassail and those that couldn’t 
screech patriotic speeches while 
the children explode firecrackers, 
not infrequently, also one or two 
fingers. 

, Come July, 1938, however, a 
narassed mankind will be ponder- 
ing two anniversaries which would 
be heart-hreakingly lugubrious did 
they not also carry with them in- 
timations of a new day, a renewed

power, the time came, as inevita- 
bly it had to come, for these ele- 
ments to fight back or lose every- 
thing. They had to fight less for 
self-preservation than the re-con- 
quest of age-old privileges they 
had enjoyed as wealthy property 
owners, beneficiaries of royal fa- 
vors, or as members of a social 
aristocracy dating back to medie- 
val times. 

A Different CivjlWar 

Thus the Spanish rebellion 
against the Popular Front govern- 
ment the outcome of which is still 
in doubt. Under another age, 
such a revolution would have been 
merely another civil war, totally 
unrelated to the fate of the world 
at large, and at the conclusion of 
which there was a transfer of po- 
wer from one element of the popu- 
lation to another. 

Why did, then, the Spanish ci- 
vil war become an event of such 
transcendent international signifi- 
cance, so much so that even now

clash 



The reason, even to the ca- 
sual newspaper reader, is obvious : 
The struggle in Spain — of the 
government to preserve the Po- 
pular Front ; of the Rebels un- 
der Franco to re-conquer power 
and privilege — represents the clash 
of new forces which, of varying 
potency, already exist . in most 
parts of the world, are in certain 
countries already moving toward 
the same critical point where, as

civil war and Sino- Japanese con- 
flict may be studied for the sig- 
nificant trends that events have 
.been taking since the settlement ot 
fthe Treaty of Versailles was open- 
ly violated by Hitler in 1934. 

In both these wars also are 
dramatically apparent clashing so- 
cial forces and philosophies which 
show every indication of altering 
the shape of things before many 
years will pass.

Armaggedon* s “Dress 

Rehearsal” 

It is for this reason that some 
writers have alluded to the Spanish 
civil war as the “dress rehearsal” 
of the coming world conflict bet- 
ween the forces of the Left and 
Right. 

In other words, many nations 
are interested in how the Spanish 
civil war will turn out precisely 
because within their own. respec- 
tive social and economic set-up are 
present those forces which in Spain 
have already clashed and are now 
grappling for mastery. 

Now, what are those forces ? 
They are variously called loosely 
as the Left and Right, Progress 
and Reaction, Socialism and Fas- 
cism. Expressed in terms of 
men’s lives, these words convey 
easily understandable meaning. 
Progress comprehensively embra- 
ces all those* ef forts to remedy the 
evils of the present economic and 
social order under which the 
immense majority of the masses 
of all countries are condemned to 
Jive in destitution, if not stark 
poverty, often, as in the case of 
the United States, amidst abundant 

natural resources vouchsafed by 

*3. XavYskv ^ atxce c . 

Reaction, on. the other hand, 
comprehensively em or aces all the 
efforts of those who now hold eco- 
nomic and social privileges to pre- 
serve the status quo, that is, to 
defend their hold on those privil- 
e^fes against the offensive of the 
militant masses to wrest it from 
them. 

Reaction Can Be Challenged 

The historical conditions which 
gave rise to these antagonistic 
forces, such as the inadequacy of 
Capitalism to solve economic pro- 
blems at the present stage of 
mankind’s technological develop- 
ment, will not be discussed here 
just now. Suffice it to say, that 
in Spain, as in Mexico previously, 
and later in France, as well as in 
the Scandinavian countries, the 
events of the last ten years have 
amply demonstrated that progres- 
sive elements, such as trade 
unions, political liberals, and the 
substratum of the middle class, 
can successfully challenge the 
reactionary elements. In other 
words, the economic and social 
order, the status quo, can be chan- 
ged. 

From that point of view it be- 
comes intelligible even at this dis- 



This cant go on j or ever 

tance why Germany, Italy Britain, 
and other countries where the 
reactionary elements are in power 
have been sympathetic to, or are 
generously aiding materially, the 
Insurgents in Spain. On the other 
hand, it is equally evident why 
the underprivileged masses all 
over the world, and the countries 
where the progressive elements 
are in power, such as Mexico, 
Czechoslovakia, the Scandinavian 
countries, and to a certain extent 
the United States and France, 
have been sympathetic to, or are 
aiding* materially, the Loyalists 
of Spain . 

No Immediate Liquidation 

With forces so widely-flung in- 
volved in the struggle in Spain, it 
is, therefore, short-sighted to ex- 



The argument of bombs. 

pect a liquidation of the civil war, 
in Spain in the immediate future. 

For the probalities arc reduced 
to these: if the insurgents win no 
peace within the country can ob- 
tain, unless the masses ot Lie 
country are completely wiped out, 

an inposibility ; if the Loyalists 

can crush the rebellion within 
Spain, the reactionary elements in 
other countries will not rest but 
will continue with their attempts 
to undermine the Popular Front 
government, as they have already, 
undermined that of France. 

In other words, the issue bet- 
ween Progress and Reaction lias no 
solution until one or the other de- 
cisively wins. Because, over the 
world today they are more or less 
evenly matched in power and 
strength, mankind is lacing in

VV/ lij can design and build in the 
VV Philippines, using local ta- 
lent, labor and materials, airplanes 
s/nu'/ar to t/ze ones recently bough 6 
by the Philippine army tram hma- 
rican manufacturers. The estim- 
ated. cost of the iob for one air- 
plane, "which takes about 100 
■working days to do, is around 
Plb, 000.00, according to figures 
furnished by Dr. F. Fabiano Im- 
perial, aeronautical expert from 
t he "University of California, and 



agement and the proper orienta- 
tion and leadership. 

“I have consulted the leading 
wood technologists of the bureau 
of forestry,” writes Dr. Imperial, 
“and was shown a specimen of 
wood that is good for aircraft pur- 
poses. The supply of this wood is 
practically inexhaustive. As to 
the cloth used to cover the wings 
and fuselages of airplanes, of 
course we are not In a position 
now to produce it here. But with 
the cooperation of the textile di- 
vision of the bureau of plant in- 
dustry, under the able direction 
of its chief, we can produce fab- 
rics that would not only be satis- 
factory for aircraft use but com- 
parable also to the best available. 
This undertaking would not be a 
financial burden on the bureau of

crafts, such as those used for mi- 
aircraft motor, Dr. Imperial says 
that we too can manufacture it 
here, although its construction is 
more difficult than the building 
of the airplane proper. If the 
Wright brothers succeeded in 
building their airplane engine at 
litary purposes. Regarding the 
'a time when the construction of 
even a low-power motor was much 
more difficult than the present 
problem of designing and building 
better and more powerful engines, 
there is no reason, according to 
him, why we can not repeat the 
same story here, it is true, he 
continues, that our foundries can 
not produce the high-quality pro- 
ducts needed in the construction 
of motors, but modern facilities 
for producing these products are 



however, an excellent army of 
mechanical engineers whose know- 
ledge of machines and sheet me- 
tal work can be easily extended 
to include aircraft technology. 
Filipino technicians, if given 
enough encouragement, adequate 
facilities and proper application 
of their knowledge, can grow to 
the level of their foreign contem- 
poraries in the more advanced 
countries. 

“Our chief difficulty would be 
metallurgical,” writes Dr. Impe- 
rial. “Consequently, our first task 
is to develop the proper technic 
of casting and forging aircraft 
materials. This is mostly experi- 
mental work designed to train 
foundry personnel and could be 
done economically by first making 
small castings and forgings of dif- 




plant industry; on the contrary, it 
wocAAbe a.wov'rvc.v source ot bcvcouvo 
tot the government and. would 
also promote our textile industry .” 

* * * 

■VFTITH. respect to the metal parts 
of the airplanes, Dr. Imperial 
claims that most of them, except 
duralumin, which is an aluminum 
alloy, can be produced here. How-

National Development Company, 
who is now head of the Imperial 
Aircraft Corporation, which was 
incorporated two weeks ago. 

This, indeed, is interesting, spe- 
cially today when the nation is 
faced with the problem of build- 
ing an air force adequate enough 
to make the Philippine army one 
of the finest and most efficient 
fighting machines in the Far East. 
Modern warfare has ceased to be 
an infantry or a navy affair; it 
’ has extended its fangs to include 
also the air, where ground guns as 
defensive weapons are in many 
ways helpless against these man - 



Can. we really Uoild airplanes 
"here? Do we have the materials? 
Do we have the talent?. We can. 

If Japan can do it, why can’t we? 

If other nations have airplane 
factories, why can’t we have one 
here? It is just a matter of know- . 
ing what we have, and mahmg 
•what we have to serve oui.no., * 
The Philippines is 



ever, due to the rapid development 
of the aircraft industry, the cost 
of duralumin is comparatively 
low. Still, it would be possible to 
find a substitute material, or do 
without it altogether, unless we 
want to manufacture bullet-proof 



available and we can get them 
SAX'? time \V£ VIOAYu. 

“The availability ot i^ateriais/' 
says Dr. Imperial, “is not our prob- 
lem. The fact that at present 
wood is the only aircraft material 
that we can produce is no reason 
why' we can not design and build 
here all-metal airplanes or costly 
liners. Unlike the ready-made air- 
planes which become obsolete 
within a very short time, the air- 
craft materials can, with proper 
care, be stored for years. Storing 
aircraft materials is a practical 
scheme because their cost does not 
exceed, in most cases, 10 per cent 
of the cost of the finished air- 
plane. Furthermore, the metallur- 
gical development of aircraft ma- 
terials will not be as rapid as the 
development of airplane design 
and construction. We can also 
build both wood-fabric and all- 
metal airplanes. Jap an has been 
able to build her powerful navy 
by using metals, mostly scraps, 
bought from the United States. 
We can do better with our air 
fore? by building our own air- 
planes, because we have the ma- 
terials here.” 

* * * 

N OR is it talent that we lack. 

We have men of Dr. Imper- 
ial’s intelligence and training who 
can be hired to do the job. While 
it is true that we have only a 
handful of men who are experts 
In aeronautical science, we have, 



ferent shapes and sizes of mater- 
ials. Engineering. Island has 
cnwigYi lacUlUes tor tVns kind of 
work and when tire quality ot cast- 
ing and forging has been suffi- 
ciently improved, the design and 
construction of the airplane en- 
gine may he undertaken.” 

Not only should the construc- 
tion of airplanes here be encour- 
aged for military purposes, but 
also to meet the requirements of 
commercial aviation. A significant 
portion of our population has be- 
come air-minded. Local business 
now considers air transport as a 
part of its system. Moreover, the 
•Philippines lies at the crossroads 
of proposed airlines in the Pacific. 
This alone should be sufficient 
encouragement for local capital to 
go into the aircraft construction 
business. If we consider, further- 
more, the fact that commercial 
planes can be easily converted, In 
wartime, into fighting machines, 
either as bombers or as transport' 
planes from front to front, we can 
readily see the advisability of de- 
signing and building our own 
airplanes here. Certainly, wo 
know our needs better than for^ 
eign manufacturers, and it is a 
part of defense strategy that mi- 
litary secrets should be locally 
planned and made. We can’t im- 
port these secrets. So why don’t 
we make our bombers here? This 
seems to be a very ambitious 
scheme, but it can be done.

QES it ever occur to modern 
girls that there is a rea 
sou for the moral laws that con- 
cern purity and self-control ? That 
humanity has slowly and painfully 
and imperfectly hammered those 
Jaws into shape, not to comply with 
any outworn creed or obsolete 
code; but for the present, living 
everyday happiness of ail con- 
cerned? 

Girls look with natural abhor- 
rence upon the murderer, the kid- 
naper, the man who commits may- 
hem, perjury, bigamy, the man 
who is charged with cruelty, in- 
temperance, fraud. No man who 
had" in boyhood forged a check 
would ever dare tell his wife. She 
would find it so disgusting, so in- 
comprehensible, that she never 
would trust him again. She would 
feel herself married to a person 
of criminal instincts, and in a way 
she would be justified. If a man 
once deliberately cheats to get out 
of a difficulty, he will cheat again. 
.That’s why ex-cons have such dif- 
ficulties in finding positions of 
trust. It is only after a complete 
spiritual regeneration, a real 
change of heart, that the thief oe- 
comes trustworthy, and that spir- 
itual change is too easily faked. 
4 Tve certainly had my lesson,” the 
freed man says fervently. “No 
% more fooling around with other 
people’s money for me.” And no- 
body believes him. 

their lives that the only road to 
self-respect and happiness, to good 
wifehood and happy motherhood 
^ is the road of self-control and 
mfk purity, continue to feel, in those 
'.s* dangerous years between sixteen 
and twenty-four, that it doesn’t 
really matter what you do; it 
hurts nobody, and nobody’ll ever 
know anyway. 

And so they do to themselves 
what their worst enemy couldn’t 
accomplish. They take a chance. 
And after that they take another. 
And just as surely as the fineness 
and sweetness of their young bo- 
*- ' dies are destroyed, so are the de- 
licate filaments of their souls; 
never to be quite what they seem 
to be again. 

Here is the case oi Jeaa Smith, 
•for example. She is a college girl , 
she came from a plain little house 
in a plain little country town to 
the fascinations of undergraduate 
life in the biggest city in the 
world, and was quickly persuaded 
that good times needn’t stop any- 
where. She had her fill of night 
clubs and dances, roadhouses and 
week-end parties during her first 
term, and went home for mid- 
summer holidays, very demurely 
reporting to a devoted father and 



A few -weeks Later she ivrote her mother the 
letter that shattered for her and for Jean’s father, 
the deepest pride and happiness of their lives . 
There will be a baby in Jane. Jean’s mother had >>l 
long talk with her daughter. 



mother only what she knew they 
wanted to ' hear about her new 
friends and interests and studies. 

Then Came Tragedy 

The second year she met a boy 
with whom she fell really and deep- 
ly in love. He knew her reputa- 
tion, of course, and they had a 
wild affair. It was at Christmas 
time that a dread suspicion began 
to grow in Jean’s heart; a few 
weeks later she wrote her mother 
the letter that shattered for her 
and for Jean’s father the deepest 
pride and happiness of their lives. 
There will be a baby in June. 

Jean’s mother came on at once 
and had a long talk with her 
daughter. One hates to think what 
was said. They wrote to the boy, 
who had inexplicably left school 
and returned to his Florida home. 
He answered; here is his letter. 
Note that it is so worded that it 
could be read in court tomorrow 
or ten years from now without 
incriminating the gallant writer in 
any way. 

‘‘Dear Jean: 

‘‘The camera you wrote mo 
about isn’t mine. Thanks awfully, 
though. I’m working like mad 
here, but of course I miss the old 
gang. But Pop and Mom want 
me home for awhile. Hopping to 
see you one of these good old days, 
y Bill.” 

Jean’s mother, aghast, was for 
going straight down to Florida to 
face him, so Jean had to tell her 
that while she had been faithful 
to Bill from the moment of her 
return to school, there had been 
others before that. 

And the real tragedy of it is 
that she is a loving, gentle, trust- 
ing little creature, this Jean. She 
adores her father and mother, and 
if this child of hers were born 
under the usual happy circum- 
stances she would love it more 
than anything else on earth. 

Destroyed Honest Happiness 
As it is they have persuaded her 
to have her baby secretly, give it 
out for adoption, and presently 
.come home “from Europe” to the 

y»ttvA\\ \vorai5 Voyju, to Te\)Ui\CL lUiT 

life there as best she can. 



home-making, wifehood and 
therhood. 



mo- 



She may marry. But young love 
won’t be what it ought to be in 
her heart or manner or feeling, 
or when another child comes to 
her. She has cheated; she has 
forged; and for every moment of 
s^elf-indulgence that these stolen 
hours have given her, she has 
destroyed a hundred hours of ho- 
nest happiness. 



Men, for thousands of years, 
have made laws for women, and 
that’s the way they work. If Jean 
were a strong, talented creature 
perhaps she could carve out a dif- 
ferent destiny, face down the 
whispers and criticisms. But she’s 
like most nineteen-year-olds; she 
wants to be like the others, in 
dress and hair-do, manners and 
amusements, engagement and en- 
gagement showers, marriage and 



“Isn’t it comfortable to be 
good?” said one of the cleverest 
women I know a few years ago, 
when with her children she was 
enjoying a middle-aged country 
holiday. “Isn’t it comfortable?” 

And that kind of comfort has 
to be bought with wisdom and 
self-control in the younger years; 
the years when many girls say, 
“What’s the difference? If I hurt 
anyone it’s only myself, and I 
guess I’m old enough to know 
what I’m doing. 

December and May Again 

But some of us never seem to 
be old enough to know what we’re 
doing. A woman of sixty-four who 
wrote me a few weeks ago want- 
ed advice as to her marriage with 
a man of twenty-eight. She says 
that he has no money and that 
she has enough, and more than 
enough for two. “He very proba- 
bly wants a comfortable home, 
and to inherit something after I 
die, and why shouldn’t he?” she 
writes. “I like love and compan- 
ionship, and he gives them to me. 
What’s so unnatural about that 
bargain? If you could hear my 
sons you’d think I was marrying 
a chimpanzee out of the zoo. Fred 
is handsome and affectionate, and 
he happens to like older women 
better than young ones. I don’t 
fool myself; I know that if I were 
a dishwasher in the hotel instead 
of happening to own it, he might- 
n’t want me. But if my. outside is 
old my inside is young; he says 

fo^Urns spirit I am young- 

er tin an many a girl ot twenty- 
five, and I want to take the 
change, I’ve been over-burdened 
and serious all my life. Is there a 
chance of happiness for me, a few 
years of it, a little fun?” 

The answer is “No.” 



I hope you’re planning a trip 
for this year. Nothing in the 
world picks up the human heart, 
fills days with excitement and 
light, like the delicious prelimina- 



ries of a trip. Tickets, maps, bud- 
get, discussions as to whether 
the , car or bicycles or good old 
shoe-leather are the best means of 
transportation ; names of strange 
places; possibilities opening up 
everywhere; clothes to be consi- 
dered; luggage to be estimated — 
why, before you even start a wind 
from far delicious mountains and 
seas seems to blow across the hum- 
drum quiet of every day, and blow 
cobv/ebs and fatigue and depres- 
sion away with it! 

Wonders Are Near at Home 

One year we had to take our 
vacation in a series of long week- 
ends; we had sixteen little breaks 
from Friday afternoon on Monday 
morning, and the places we went 
and the things we did and saw 
remain in my memory still as 
among the real holidays of my 
life. One woman who wrote me 
had ten weeks in Europe last year 
without one cent of expense. She 
made the proposal herself to the 
doctor mother of two girls of 
twelve and fourteen; took them 
and the car to England, did all the 
driving herself ; managed cur- 
rency and meals and passports 
with the greatest possible courage 
and competency, — although she 
had been abroad only once before, 
and that many years ago, and 
came home with two adoring and 
chattering little charges who had 
gotten exactly what their mother 
had wanted them to get out of 
Europe, at a minimum of expense. 

Another family walked into the 
high Sierras; two hundred miles 
to get there, and they managed 
another hundred after they got in. 

' What their wonderful three week3 
cost them was merely their food. 
The two tall sons, father and 
mother carried packs and blan- 
kets; the little daughter carried 
herself ;. their holiday cost them 
less than one hundred dollars, and 
they came back with memoriea 
worth half a million. 

For every summer week-end 
plan something. And I don’t mean 

just having the Judsons out and 
playing bridge. Explore and ex- 
periment; court high adventure 
and she will come to you, and 
you’ll find that within a hundred 
miles from home there are placea 
and people as interesting as the 
Pyramids — which, by the way, 
are disappointing enough in real- 
ity and look like a rather moth- 
eaten movie set — and the Tuiller- 
ies and the Roman fora, and the 
long level reaches of the. suthmer 
Thames near Oxford town.

Promoting Our Abaca Industry

rj-'.HE scheme of price fixing and 
1 price stabilization is not new; it 
lias been and is being practiced by 
many countries which have either a 
quasi or complete monopoly of the 
raw materials. It is characterized 
by the collective action on the part 
of the producers with the support 
of or government participation in, 
the control. The raw materials 
that were subjected to this scheme 
Of control are: (y) camphor by, 

Japan in Formosa, (2) chinchona. 
bark, or quinine by Holland in Java, 

(3) citrate of lime by Italy, (4) 
coffee by Brazil, (5) cotton, long 
staple by Egypt, (6) currants by, 
Greece, (7) kauri-gum by New Zea- 
land, (8) mercury by Spain and 
Italy, (0) nitrate by Chile, (10) 
pear- .'shell by Australia, (11) potash 
by Germany and France, (12) pulp- 
wood by Canada, (13) quebracho by 
Argentina and Paraguay, (14) silk 
by Japan, (15) sisal by Yucatan, 
Mexico, (10) sugar by Cuba, (17) 
sulphur by the United States and 
Italy, and (18) tin by the British 
colonies in the Federated Malay 
States, Australia and Nigeria. 

The main objects of the control 
were first, the desire to obtain pu- 
blic revenue in the form of export 
tax, second, to maintain or increase 
the profits of the producers of the 
raw materials in the form of the 
regulation of production or market- 
ing for the purpose of enabling the 
producers to obtain higher prices 
than they would, otherwise oh tain, 

and it has involved government ac- 
tion designed to furnish the means 
of such regulations; and third, to 
foster and extend domestic manu- 
facturing industry or to favor do- 
mestic industries by enabling them 
to secure raw materials at a Tower 
price than their foreign competitors 
have to pay. 

In the case of abaca, the schemes 
of control should be concentrated on 
these two main objectives — to main- 
tain a fair price for the producers 
and to foster the industrialization 
program of the Commonwealth 
through the National Development 
Company- 

It must be remembered that in the 
Philippine Tariff Act of March 8, 
1902, the United States Congress 
created a discrimination by remit- 
ting the Philippine export duty upon 
abaca when it was shipped directly 
to the United States for use and 
consumption thex’ein. The discrimi- 
nation lasted until 1913, when the 
United States Tariff Act of October 
3, 1913, abolished export duties in 
the Philippine Islands and the dis- 
criminatory feature accordingly lap- 
sed- At present the abaca fiber is 
cn the free list but not its manu-; 
factures — cordage, twine, etc. which 
are subject to limitation and export 
tax. The reasons for this is to 
favor the home industry of the 
United States. 

' At present we have the sad ex- 
perience of having a natural mono- 
poly of abaca without any influence 
' at all in the regulation of its 
price to protect the producers and 
to diversify our home industry. In 
economic parlance monopoly means 
the absolute control of the supply 
and with this absolute control to- 
gether with the analysis of the 
demands and costs, price would be 
fixed at a point that would bring 
the greatest profit to the producers. 
We could not do this to our mono, 
poly of abaca because there is ho 
regulation of the supply due to 
lack of concerted action of the pro- 
ducers, and the marketing side is 
controlled by foreigners who ars 
well organized financially and col- 
lectively- The remedy for this is

tlie part o£ tfie government. The 
place of abaca in our national eco- 
nomy, tlie present poor condition 
of the industry reflected by the 
abnormal low price of the abaca 
fiber and the natural monopoly of 
the plant enjoyed by the Philip- 
pines, justify such scheme of gov- 
ernment control and regulations* 
Every industry has its own pro- 
blem peculiar to itself affected 
specially by its nature of produc- 
tion, consumption, and distribution. 
No set of standard scheme of gov- 
ernment control or regulations can 
be set up which could be applied to 
ail industries. Consider, for exam- 
ple, the application of the National 
Rice and Corn Corporation into the 
abaca industry in the form of the 
National Abaca Corporation- The 
success of this scheme will depend 
more on the technique of the ad- 
ministration of the corporation 
rather than upon the form of or- 
ganization. The type of man who 
will handle the scheme of control 
would decide the success and failure 
of the system- The price of rice 
is easy to control because it is a 
basic commodity with fixed demand 
and is produced only for local con- 
sumption. Whereas in the case of 
aoaca, the problem of price control 
is rathe* complicated. But our 
monopoly of abaca puts us in a 
better position regarding the price 
control. 

The adoption of compulsory co- 
operation among the abaca produ- 
cers can not be over emphasized. Of 
all the export products of the Phil- 



nel of distribution, that is, it hua 
the most middlemen— it reaches aft 
far as seven middlemen when the 
product reaches the final consumer. 
The manager of the fiber inspection 
service says that “if the distribu- 
tion of the market value of abaca 
is investigated and analysed, it 
will be found out that the owner 
of the abaca plantation hardly gets 
three per cent (3 per cent) of the 
price paid for fiber in the market.” 
The problem of distribution is the 
key to the solution of the problems 
and the producers must cooperate 
together. 

An important factor that must 
be considered is the constant fluc- 
tuations of prices of abaca as com- 
pared with the other Philippine 
products. The price of abaca is 
always subject to speculation that 
the market is always the buyers' 
market* This is because the local 
and foreign consumers in England, 
tlie United States and Japan are 
all well organized and could fully 
influence the market at the expense 
of the unorganized producers. 

Compulsory cooperation alone is 
not sufficient, but it must be syn- 
chronized by education and -supervi- 
sion of production. It must be re- 
membered that the price fluctuations 
and depression of abaca is not due 
to overproduction, but to relative 
production* Certain grades of abaca 
are overproduced while other grades 
are underproduced* The producers 
do not follow the requirements of 
the consumers of each particular 
market. This is due to ignorance as 
well as to the too much independ- 



ence of the producers. Small P ^

derived from such e.orpora'&cm. 
is the establishment of reliable 
statistical information that would 
serve as the basis of price forecast- 
ing. The demand for abaca is most- 
ly influenced by the cordage indus- 
try which is in fact influenced by 
the business cycles. Price forecast- 
ing is now possible by the analyses 
of the different indexes of the busi- 
ness barometers. With the present 
analysis of the price fluctuation of 
abaca it is found out that business 
depression does not influence very 
much the trends of abaca price in 
the foreign market of consumption, 
but to a great extent by the techni- 
que of the market and speculation. 

The demand being not so elastic as 
to the progress of business condi- 
tions and with reliable statistics, the 
possibility of the pre-determination 
of demand like that of rice is pos- 
sible and hence price fixing 'could 
be stabilized at a reasonable amount 
for the good of the consumers and - 
of the producers interest- At pre- 
sent, statistical data for price fixing 
and stabilization is sadly lacking. 

Price stabilization should not be 
attempted by limitation of produc- 
tion in the case of hemp. Price 
stabilization by limited production 
unreasonably means higher price to 
consumers with greater profits even 
to the poorest or marginal pro- 
ducers. This method would not only 
discourage improvement in the tech- 
nique of production, but it would also 
enrourage competition or substitu- 
tion. If the consumers will be forced 
to pay unreasonably higher price by 
limiting the supply, they will

HUMANE TOUCH 



*TPHE basic idea in the establish- 
ment of the penal colony, of- 
ficially known as the Common- 
wealth Farm, in Muntinglupa, Ri- 
zal, has something to do with the 
recent scandal in which an in- 
mate, Rafael Fernandez, of the no- 
torious sugar quedans case, is in- 
volved. If it did not directly cause 
the alleged scandal, it at least 
helped open certain valves that 
gave vent for likely commission of 
things like that. It is to be regret- 
ted that in such a well -conceived 
proposition as the penal farm, the 
occurrence of an unpleasant news 
had to mar its operation, but then 
it is because, not in spite of its be- 
ing a model farm, that the case 
came up. 

Conceived in 1936 by Gen. Pau- 
Y.tvo Santos, then director oi the 
bureau of prisons, the Common- 
wealth Farm became the pet pro- 
ject of the administration. It was 
planned on the experiences of pe- 
nal farm management in Iwahig 
and Davao, with a few more im- 
provements thought of by the of- 
ficials added to make it a model 
penal colony. 

The farm is a forty-five-hectare 
country of rolling topography of 
cogon - covered hillocks, mango 

groves, shrubs, and a creek. It is 
separated from the main town of 
Muntinglupa by a natural elongat- 
• ed hill that forms like a massive 
wall running approximately one- 
third the distance around the pe- 
nal farm. Upon this wall a wide 
gateway has been cut by prison 
labor, and from this opening, a 
dusty road unfolds down to the 
town about a kilometer away. La- 
guna de Bay, quiet and serene, 
stands far away to form a pic- 
turesque background of the town 
ana the penal colony. 

Upon entering the Common- 
wealth Farm through this main

gate cut through the tremendous 



bosom of an elongated hill, the vi- 
sitor breathes fresh, pure air from 
the hills and surrounding coun- 
tryside. He senses, not the feeling 
of men in iron chain but of souls 
living in the lease of freedom and 
easy existence. 

* * -k 

T HE atmosphere about the place 
translates in its own language 
the essence of the farm: freedom. 
Here 850 convicts, some serving 
life terms, are made to feel that 
they are not tethered by penalty, 
but are in all ways made to forget 
that they are prisoners and should 
feel like those outside the wall of 
hill and beyond the gate and the 
guard. In the Muntinglupa con- 
victs’ village, the inmates enjoy 
comparatively more privileges 
than their fellow prisoners in Bi- 
libid. They wear the regulation 
blue suit with white stripes, but 
their daily routine and the way. 
they are administered allow them 
certain freedom of action in the 
village and subsequently give them 
the consciousness that they ap- 
proximate the lives of free men. 

This manner of administration 
has been partly outlined on hu- 
man psychology. The treatment 
of prisoners that is divested, 
wherever possible, of the rigour 
and strictness of dealing with con- 
demned men, not only gives in- 
mates a feeling of ease but arous- 
es in them hope. That, in the 
opinion of administrators, is a. 

'TCYO'Cfe tjVVecAAvc ACxcLor TGtonnVng 

the misguided and the erring 
hearts. 

This has been proven true. Re- 
forming convicts by avoiding rigid 
discipline of the rifle and the stick 
has been effective in majority of 
instances in the Commonwealth 
Farm. The prisoners are remark- 
ably docile, tame and good-natur- 



ed. They are rather happy and in 
their sense of security, they take 
their daily task in earnest. 

Next to making them feel more 
like free villagers in one vast ru- • 
ral community than prisoners 
with armed guards watching their 
every step, the convicts in Mun- 
tinglupa are taught how to be self 
sufficient. They live together as 
people in a barrio who should till 
the farms, build roads, catch fish, 
raise vegetables, make their own 
furniture, in order to live. Each 
one has his task in community 
living. 

For this purpose, the 850 in- 
mates of the Muntinglupa Farm 
have been grouped into the var- 
ious departments: public works, 
duckery, agriculture, carpentry, 
mechanical and others. They meet 
their own needs. They eat fruits 
and vegetables raised in their 
farms. They make their own 
household furniture in the carpen- 
try shop. They have a tile depart- 
ment where roofing materials are 
made. Some are assigned to the 
public works to make roads and 
bridges and dam in the village. 
The convicts in Muntinglupa have 
better meals than those in Mani- 
la, for the former have vegetables 
and duck eggs aplenty. The duck- 
ery produces 20,000 eggs each 
month. Excess production is sent 
to outside markets, and thus the 
Commonwealth Farm has been a 
profit-making proposition. Many 

orders for UVe rooting materials, 

chairs, poultry products and ash- 
trays and flower-pots designed ar- 
tistically by prison hands have 
been received from outside, and 
the farm’s cash mounts. 

* * * 

T HE villagers have been grouped 
into two: the living-in and the 
living-out groups. The former are 
housed in the big building, are po- 



liced and live a more regulated 
life. The latter live separately in 
small houses scattered about the 
farm. They enjoy much more 
freedom than the others. They 
keep their own house; they don’t 
follow the rigid routine that con- 
victs in the other group follow. 

An instance of a privilege en- 
joyed by prisoners is that of a 
life-termer, a bent old man from 
Cebu, who spends his spare time 
making ukeleles and guitars 
which he sells to his companions 
or outsiders who place orders 
through the Commonwealth Farm 
officials. Many of the inmates are 
provided with “ukes” and guitars, 
and when they get together in an 
afternoon it’s like the old merry 
gang back in the home-town. 

Every Saturday evening, the 
whole village populace gathers in 
the theater for the regular week- 
ly treat to a movie. The bureau of 
prisons makes arrangements for 
the showing of dialect talkies free 
to all the inmates in the Common- 
wealth Farm. Extra entertain- 
ments in the form of stage pres- 
entations, sometimes by the pris- 
oners themselves, and lectures on 
social subjects by a guest social 
worker are provided, but the 
talkie show gets much of the Sat- 
urday evening time. 

Such privileges and freedom as 
the Commonwealth Farm extends 
to its inmates can be carried to 
abuse. If the alleged swindle of 
P24.000 reportedly committed by 
one of the supposedly well-be- 
haved prisoner, Rafael Fernan- 
dez, is true, may it not be suppos- 
ed that it is clue to (he fact oe- 
cause more than enjoying the ge- 
nerosity oi life in the Farm, he 
utilized his certain privileges and 
took advantage of the freedom al- 
lowed him? 

In the meantime the court of 
justice as well as the bureau of 
prisons officials are jointly inves- 
tigating the case, and whatever 
its outcome, there are bound to 
be reforms with regards to the 
administration of the Common- 
wealth Farm.

these speculations have made wild on i y at t a in this ideal when

predict that the “old, silent man’’ 
will wield the gavel for the next 
three years. 

Political prophets are every- 
where to be found nowadays. This 
is the natural consequence of pre- 
electoral days. Speaker Montilla, 
occupying' as he does the third 
most important elective post un- 
der the Commonwealth, can not 
escape being a focal point of na- 
tional interest. 

Speaker Gil Montilla will, X 
think, have quite a harder time 
in being re-elected in his district 
in Occidental Negros than in re- 
taining his present office. Even, 
so, Montilla is still conceded the 
favorite candidate in his district. 
Once reelected, the speakership 
will come to him in the natural 
oi’der of things. 

In the first place, judging from 
the present preparations now 
being made by the Nationalist 
party, no new men will come to 
the next Assembly with the idea 
of disputing the gavel of the 
chamber. To be precise, Resident 
Commissioner Quintin Paredes, 
although sure of his election in 
Abra, would not aspire for the 
speakership with that office 
shorn of its former powers. And 
even if he wants to, he will still 
have a hard time getting all his 
former followers into line. It is a 
herculean task to do it under the 
present relationship obtaining be- 
tween the executive and the legis- 
lative branches of the Common- 
wealth government. 

It is an admitted fact that in line 
the economic program of the na- 
tional government, a stronger 
Chief Executive with a docile le- 
gislative body is the most desiri 
able arrangement. This is the 
best way to insure the smooth 
running of the government, a ne- 
cessary condition for the success 
of the complete home rule grant- 



monwealth, it would be unwise for 
him to share his leadership 

the two other branches of tn< 

government when he is to be th 
foie individual accountable to th 
United States for the success c 
the new government.^ 

P resident Quezon will nee 

Speaker Montilla more m tt 
next National Assembly than i 
the first. For during the secon 
half of his administration, H 
must necessarily be a stronge 
executive with the National Ai 
sembly worVmg solidly with, bite 
Montilla’ s loyalty, either to tl 
President or to his colleagues 
the chamber, has never bei 
found wanting. His subtle wi 
of pleasing everybody and makii 
a success of it is a virtue whi< 
very few politicians posses. 

Now, we come to other speake 
ship timbers like Secretary of I 
nance Antonio de las Alas, suai 
and subtle in his political dealing 
or Secretary of the Interior E 
pidio Quirino, dominant and deter- 
mined in his political maneuvers. 
They are at this writing all out of 
the race as they have not yet an- 
nounced their intention to rim for 
a seat in the Assembly. Sugar 
Administrator Rafael Alunan, ma- 
jority floor leader once in the 
former house of representatives 
and therefore also a possible 
speaker, has likewise not given us 
any definite assurance regarding 
his return to active politics. 

Tactful Assemblyman Manuel 
Roxas and handsome Floorleader 
Jose E. Romero are not candi- 
dates for the speakership. They, 
too, at least the former, have a 
much higher aspiration. 

Other present leaders of the 
chamber, outside of Speaker Mon- 
' tilla, I believe, have not won the 
good graces of the President, 



whose advice and counsel will be /resident Quezon titular head

The legislative crisis caused by 
La Union Assemblyman Camilo

ident on the Zandueta appoint- 
ment, could have been prevented 
if only the loyal members of the 
chamber raised the question of or- 
der while Osias was revealing the 
proceedings of the commission 
when this proceedure was contra- 
ry to its rules, has shown Monti- 
lla’s tact. He did not put the 
fighting solon out of order with- 
out any member raising the ques- 
tion of order. It would have been, 
quite improper for the speaker to 
do it on his own initiative, even, 
if he had the right to do so.

ter that they began to realize the 
greatest parliamentary discourte-

the man who is protecting and 
promoting their political interests. 

* * -K 

W ITH this situation in the As- 
sembly as it is, it would be 
foolhardy to predict that the next 
speaker will be other than Speak- 
er Montilla. A leader who is not 
thirsty for power does not hurt 
or offend his colleagues, and that 
man is the incumbent speaker. 
Dubbed as the old, silent man who 
does not speak much but gets 
things well done, Speaker Monti- 
lla is the man that gets things 
done in the Assembly. 

So many criticisms have been, 
launched against Montilla, either 
by the outsiders or the legislators 
themselves, yet he has been elect-,

P. I. Officials Who Have 
Won Foreign Decorations

President Quezon, General Valdes, Mariano Jesus 
Cuenco, Felipe Cuaderno And Others Have Been 
Decorated By Alien Governments And The Holy 
See 



ceremoniously enacted, “without Ex- 
ecutive approval,” President Quezon 
purposely and discreetly avoiding 
action on it because he was person- 
ally affected. Due to a well esta- 
blished practice, the bill automatic- 
ally became a law (Commonwealth 
Act No. 252) because the bill to 
that effect was not acted upon with 
a fixed number of days alter its 
passage by the National Assembly. 
A presidential veto on the bill should 
have been improper and unusual on 
the part of the President. It would 
have been an insult upon the Chin- 
ese nation, which v/as always been 
generally friendly to the Philippines, 
if President Quezon vetoed that 
piece of legislation whose announced 
purpose was ic promote “interna- 
tional friendship and understand- 
ing.” 

That was not the first time that 
the greatest living Malayan patriot 
and Chief Executive received high 
foreign decorations and honors .

PRESIDENT QUEZON 

China bestwed on him the Order of the BrUliant Jade 



N O laid granting a title of nobility 
shall be enacted , and no person 
holding any office of trust shall, 
without the consent of the National 
Assembly, accept any present, emo- 
lument, office, or title of any kind 
'whatever from any foreign state- 
Under this Constitutional inhibi- 
tion in our local Bill of Rights (Sec- 
tion 9, Article III), four P. I. Com - 
monwealth officials have so far been 
allowed to accept foreign decorations 
from Belgium, Egypt, China, and 
French Indo-China and to wear the 
corresponding insignias of the re- 
spective orders thus conferred. The 
lucky recipients are His Excellency, 
President Manuel L. Quezon ; Major 
General Basilio J. Valdes,' deputy 
chief of staff, P.A.; Captain Ciriaco 
Carillo of the coast guard service; 
and Felipe Cuaderno, assistant di- 
rector, Bureau of Posts. It became 
the "task” of the First National 
Assembly to act on the bills and re- 
solutions dealing with foreign deco- 
rations- . 

The highest honor in the gut o.t 
the National Government of China 
for foreigners is the Order oj the 
Brilliant Jade. This the Chinese Re- 
public conferred ceremoniously upon 
cur Chief Executive when he stopped 
over in that country last year en- 
route to Washington, D- C. to con- 
fer with U. S. President Roosevelt 
on Vne Independence question. The 
Order of the Brillmit Jade, which is 
bestowed only uoon a. oC 

ernmW, co^ ot a reel cravat 
Vv-xtti a white border. President 
Quezon headed the list of the 193 
3STew Year honors. Others givv_n

Gugglielmo Marconi, celebrated 
Italian inventor of the wireless,

M. V. Munters, Latvian foreign

ciation in America; Martin Wron- 
sky, president of the German Luf- 
thansa Airline; and President Juan 
Trippe and Chairman Cornelias 
Vanderbilt of the Pan American 
Airways. 

The announcement that President 
Quezon was going to be decorated 
the Chinese government was 
on January 4, 



[A. JOB General Basilio 3. Valdes 
has won the distinction of 
having been allowed to receive two 
foreign decorations ever since the 
Constitution of the Commonwealth 
has been in operation. Before the 
institution of the present govern- 
ment, this handsome French-Spini sh- 
English-Tagalog speaking high offi- 
cer and surgeon in the Philippine 
Army had received military decora- 
tions for distinguished service in the 
Philippines and in Europe. Under 
the Commonwealth, he was confer- 
red the Order of Commandeur du 
Dragon de V Annum by the Govern- 
ment General of French Indo-China 
and His Majesty, the Emperor of 
Annam. Likewise he was honored 
with the order of Officer of the 



ffwage of diplomacy (French) again 
and because he was a scientist, he 
was assigned to accompany and help 
King Leopold (then Prince and 
Duke of Brabant) and his Royal 
Consort, on a scientific cruise, part- 
icularly to gather rare Philippine 
butterflies. I will never forget that 
royal visit because I was able to in- 
terview the Belgian monarch despite 
his announcement that lie would not 
give any direct press interview in 
Manila?* I was then a water-front 
reporter of flic Manila Daily Bulletin 
and the Bureau of Science was one 
of my regular “beats-” It so hap- 
pened that I was in the Buieau of 
Science building when the Belgian 
prince was being shown the exhibits 
of that scientific center by Director 
William H. Brown, the late Leon 
Ma. Guerrero, and one local Amer- 
ican scientist, who is an authority 
on Philippine butterflies. The Bel- 
gian royalty, not realizing that I 
was a press representative and he, 
believing that I waa probably scient- 
ist of some sort, talked with me 
about his profound love for hut tor- 
. 1 dies. ItJy*Jntorvie\v with him was a 
lYorit \v:v.gc slovv in Vhc Manila Daily 
Bulletin. 

Of all the officers of the Philip- 
pine Constabulary, Major-General 
V aides was the most qualified to ac- 
company the royal visitor from Bel- 
gium. General Valdes is a handsome 
gentleman, very pleasant to talk 
with, a reputable surgeon, well 
travelled, and cultured. A lover of 
tennis, this recipient of two foreign 
decorations was a captain and first 
assistant to Col. Keller in the Amer- 
ican Red Cross (-1917-1918) and 
chief surgeon in the Military Hospi- 
tal ( Arc En-Barrois Haute) in Mar- 
ne, France (1918-1919). In the 
Philippine Constabulary, he held 
successively the ranks of First 
Lieutenant, Captain, Major, and Sur- 
geon, Lieutenant Colonel, Chief Sur- 



Order of the Belgian Crown con- geon, Brigadier-General and Chief of 



by 



made in Nanking 

1937. 

It was on December 21, 1937 when 
a bill (No. 2759 filed by Dr- Benito 
T Soliven. assemblyman for the first 
district of Ilocos Sur) passed by 



ferred upon him by His Majesty, the 
King of the Belgian in “appreciation 
of services rendered.” 

The Governor of Indo-China was 
here in the Philippines on a good- 
will visit when the Governor General 
of the Philippines was Dwight F. 
Davis, donor of the Davis Cup. The 
Philippine Government assigned him 
to accompany the visiting Governor 
General because of his linguistic 
ability- 

Due to his mastery of the la,n~ 



our unteameral legislature, was un- ^

of the National Research Council, 
prominent member of the Colegio

the P- I. Medical Asspciution, and the 
Manila Medical Association. He was 
formed^ a professor in the medical

at her parents often, but she- did 
not become impatient with him. 
Then when he was about to go, 
he said, “We are coming to your 
place early tonight. We shall 
make plnip.g.” He walked back 
to where his carabao stood wait- 
ing patiently and he took its lead- 
rope and slapped its rumps play- 
tuny snd then shouted “Hi-yan,” 
and the carabao and the sled 
lumbered away. 

Talia returned to her work, but 
for a long time she could not 
leave off thinking of him and she 
thought often how funny he was 
because he was very awkward. 
She had seen him only four of 
five times and he had not yet 
spoken to her more than a dozen 
words, but she already knew from 
his friends that he was in love 
with her. Last night and thrice 
before* that, he and his friends 
haa come to serenade ' her. She 
had asked him to sing last night, 
but he had said he didn’t 'know 
how, and his friends coaxed him 
and she looked at him and at last 
he said he would. He only got half 
way through, then he broke off. 
His friends had tried to make up 
forit, but she had told them it was 
all right.

-5- went back to the house to 



have their dinner, but they stayed 
only for a very short time. Soon 
they were back in the fields. The 
afternoon had grown almost un- 
bearably hot and heat waves 
danced and fanned the dusty 
fields. The people were still at 
work and there was not much 
talk or laughter as in the morn- 
ing- 

Late in the afternoon the 
man passed by on his way 
again.- and he stopped for a mo- 
ment. When she saw him she 
smiled and he smiled back, but he 
did wot come to her side. She 
■went to work again, but every 
now and then she would turn her 
.head to look at him and he was 
Btill there. He grinned every time 
she glanced in his direction, but 
she did not think that he was 
grinning like an idiot. For her mo- 
ther had noticed him and had ask- 
ed her, “What, is the matter with 
Ciano? He is grinning like an 

o f ,” but she said this not un- 
kindly. 

It was already quite dark when 
they came home loaded with 
sheaves of palay. Julian stacked 
them in a corner of the yard while 
Talia went uo the house to cook 
their supper. The couple who own- 
ed the house came home and Ju- 
lian and his wife rested and chat- 
ted with tfrem in the yard. Talia 
could hear their voices and she 
wanted she was out in the yard 
too where the darkness and the 
cooling wind soothed their tired 
bodies. But she wondered when 
Ciano and his friends were 
coming and maybe there would - 
be a little fun afterwards. She 
did not feel very tired any more 
and she wished she could take a 
bath in the river, but she knew 
her mother would forbid after a 
whole day out in the sun. 

They came after supper and 
she met them in the yard. Her 
mother was up in the house mak- 
ing her youngest child sleep and 
her father had gone to the village. 
She did not feel very constrained 



because her father was away and 
in a moment she was chatting and 
laughing with the two girls who 
had also come. The young men 
found seats on a log near the lad- 
der and they talked, while one 
idly strummed a guitar. Then af- 
terwards someone suggested that 
they make pinipig and the others 
said “all right,” and they made 
ready the mortar and pestles 
while Talia went up the house 
again to get the bag of half-ripen- 
ed palay she had gathered. Soon 
three young men were pounding 
the rice. Ciano wielded an old, 
heavy pestle and his bare arms 
rippled as he swung the pestle. 

Talia sat on the lowest rung of 
the ladder and beside her, Aldo 
talked in a low voice. He had ma- 
naged to get her aside from the 
the other girls and now he was 
talking earnestly to her. Some- 
times she would look up at Ciano 
and see his strong, muscular arm 
and his body swaying a little. She 
listened attentively to the young 
man talking to her and sometimes 
she smiled a little, but she did not 
talk much. 

Afterwards, while she winnow- 
ed the unhusked grams, Ciano 
came over to where his friends 
sat and he said, “How?” and Aldo 
looked at him and said that every- 
thing was all right. “She and 
her folks might be leaving soon,” 
Aldo said and at this Ciano be- 
came somewhat anxious. “The 
harvest is nearly done and they’ll 
be leaving soon/’ said Aldo. “Yes,” 
mumbled Ciano and shook his head 
a little and wiped off the perspira- 
tion from his face and arms. “I • 
hope sbe stays longer,” be said 
again. The other replied, “I’ll 
hurry her up a little.” Talia came 
back and saw the two talking 
about her, but she made as if she 
did not notice them. 

M -k * 

(~TANO hardly talked to her the 
^ while they crunched pinipig 
and chatted and laughed. At times 
she would ask him a question 
and he would mumble something 
in reply, but he did not come near 



her and only looked at her from 
where he sat some distance away. 
One of the girls sang and the gui- 
tarist nodded his head in time and 
munched. Ciano thought that it 
would be funny if someone were 
to shovel pinipig into the singer’s 
mouth as she reached a high note 
and he smiled broadly. Talia 
caught him thus smiling and she 
imagined he was getting into the 
spirit of the fun. Aldo sat beside 
her and seemed to be earnestly 
pleading. 

Old man Julian came home and 
he seemed good-humored for he 
had taken some drinks in the vi- 
llage. He stopped for a while in 
the yard and looked around at the 
young people and as his presence 
seemed to have dampened their 
fun somewhat, he said, “Go on, 
folks, don’t mind me.” He stayed 
for some time longer and then he 
went up to the house. Ciano had 
been watching him and then when 
he was gone, he wanted very 
much to go near Talia and speak 
to her and make her laugh be- 
cause he had found out that the 
old man was hot as grouchy as he 
had imagined. But he did not 
leave his seat. Then after a while 
his cheerfulness began to ebb 
away and he became silent and 
watchful again. 

Then when they were leaving, 
Ciano said. “Are you going away 
soon?” and Talia said, “Yes, they 
were.” They lived in another vil- 
lage quite far away and they had 
only come for the harvest. “Next 
week?” he repeated. “Maybe a lit- 
tle later,” she replied. It was al- 
ready near midnight and cocks 
were crowing shrilly from ,the 
neighboring farmhouses. They left 
and took the trail to the village 
and one young man sang on the 
way. They hurried because the 
girls said their parents might 
scold them and when they came 
to the village, they parted com- 
pany. 

In the succeeding nights, Ciano 
and Aldo and several other 
friends went to see Talia and 
sometimes they came back again 



near dawn to serenade her. Often 
during the day Ciano would pass 
by near where she was harvesting 
and he would stop and exchange 
a word or two with her. She was 
always kind to him and he took 
courage and helped her and her 
mother gather in the sheaves. Old 
man Julian was not very friendly, 
but sometines he paused awhile to 
speak with him. 

One day Aldo said to him, “Ta- 
lia is coming with us tonight,” 
and Ciano looked dumbly and af- 
ter a while he asked if he meant 
that night. “Yes,” said Aldo. 
“We’ll go there about midnight. 
She will come away with us." Cia- 
no felt happy all day, but he did 
not go to the field where Talia 
was working. 

But that night Talia did not 
go away with them. The two 
friends hid near the house wait- 
ing for her to come down ready to 
take her away. The moments 
dragged slowly and all around 
them in the bushes the night in- 
sects chirped monotonously. But 
the house remained quiet and 
dark. Then Aldo said again, 
“Maybe she has not heard the 
signal,” and he whistled again, 
but even after they had waited for 
some more minutes to pass, she did 
not come down from the house. 
Aldo was getting nervous, but the 
other remained unmoved and sil- 
ent. “Maybe she has fallen as- 
leep or she has become afraid,” 
said Aldo. The night air was be- 
coming chilly and mosquitoes 
buzzed in their ears' and bit them 
and Aldo cursed under his breath. 

The next morning Ciano saw 
Talia and she told him that she 
could not come away with them 
last night because she had become 
frightened. She had told her 
father a little and the old mail 
had asked her to tell Ciano to come 
to him. The young man stood 
unmoving for a long time and then 
he said, “I’ll come and see your 
father tonight,” and he hoped the 



old man would be in good humor. 



Then he said “Hi-yah” and the 
carabao, eased forward. “Hi-yah,- 
hi-yah,” he said again and Talia 
thought that his voice sounded 
cheerful and she hummed a lit- 
tle.

A NOTHER recipient of a Belgian 
decoration is 



— Captain Ciriaco 

Carillo of the local coast guard ser- 
vice. He was given the order of 
Chevalier of the Order of the Bel- 
gian Crown from the King of the 
Belgians a few years ago. Captain 
Carillo was then in command of the 
P. I. government cutter that was 
used in the scientific cruise by King 
Leopold, who was hunting for rare 
Philippine butterflies. The cutter 
was given through the courtesy of 
Col. Theodore Roosevelt, Jr-, the 
Governor General here at the time. 

Personable, modest, and big-sized 
Old Salt, this fair complexioned ship 
captain is not yet well known to the 
public in general. Even waterfront 
reporters do not know much about 
liis life beyond the fact that he is 
the trusted Skipper of the Arayat 
and that he was the real terror of 
illicit alien immigration in southern 
waters a few years ago. As far as 
the writer knows, Captain Carillo 
w'as never mentioned in any who s

F ELIPE Cuaderno, hard-working 
assistant director of the Bureau 
of Posts, is the holder of a decora- 
tion conferred upon him by His 
Majesty, King Fuad (now deceased) 
of Egypt for attending the Xth 
World’s Postal Congress held in 
Cairo from February to March, 1934. 

Mr. Cuaderno was the lone Filipino 
delegate to this international confab, 
which was attended by the repre- 
sentat ives of S3 nations. We was 
designated by Governor Murphy. 
The meet was very significant in 
that the Philippines was treated 
;ike an independent state, the P- I. 
postal service being independent 
from that of the United States of 
America. From Cairo Mr. Cuaderno 
continued his trip around the world, 
at his own financial expense, and 
made observations in big post offices 
of Europe and America. 

Mr. Cuaderno is a good example 
of an industrious and silent Filipino 
official. You can see him working 
in his office in the 2nd floor of the 
Bureau of Posts even on holidays. 
He has always time and attention 
for anybody who visits him in his 
office. If it were not for the Consti- 
tutional proviso compelling all Fili- 
pino officials to get permission from 
the National Assembly before finally 
accepting foreign decorations, the 
public should have not known of the 
Egyptian decoration offered him. 

The public career of Mr. Cuaderno 
has been linked with the Bu leau of 
posts, which h e has been serving 
during the last 20 years- He was 
one of those assigned to the Bureau 
of Posts when Governor Francis 
Burton Harrison started his lUipini- 
nization of government personnel. 
Entering the government service 26 
years ago as clerk, he has served in 
the former Bureau of Navigation, 
the Executive Bureau, the Philip- 
pine Commission, and the office of 
the American governor general. He 
Ids the LI. B. degree.

IF FLOWERS COULD TALK — 



T HE meadows and gardens cover a much wider space 
than all the streets and buildings on the surface of 
the earth. There is a wider blanket of living green than 
all the skins of mankind put together. This could mean 
one thing: Creation , from the First Effect millions of 
years ago to such age when life can no longer exist in 
any form on this planet of ours , is ever growing and 
beautiful Being beautiful, there seems to be no reason 
why it should be scorched in our homes where its spirit 
has taken refuge, made its cradle, written its music, and 
become the hope and the light in our eyes. 

There are millions of wild and domestic flowers on 
earth. There is, for instance, the morning glory that 
now flirts with the sunshine as bells court your con- 
science, your faith and your love. Do you observe how 
it enjoys playing with the cool morning air? Do you 
see how its pink builds chapels at sunset as if the world 
were kneeling before its five-lobed corolla m the ) darken- 
ing skv? Do you notice how sweetly it takes life . How 
many hearts has it quickened? How many songs has it 
given to the bumble-bees, our hedges and the sky . 

Morning glories have no quarrel with the world. ^ 
T'Yiev "have no \\ates to nurse or to Icude. 

Thev are °-lad. If they could 'talk — if they had tongues 
and'couldlalk to us now— they would want to take our 
seats and show us that peace, freedom, life and love do 
not consist in silks and jewels and looks but m the spiri- 
tual wealth of the heart. . , , ? 

Why do flowers have fragrance? Why their bloom . 

Beauty does not bask in the sunlight like the idle pray- 
ers of souls forlorn. It serves a better purpose, Flow- 
ers know, in the silence of their sylvan loveliness, that 
they are here to make life real and sweet. There is a 
sense of eternal youth on petals, smiling m the breeze, 
in the dew, in the rain, or in the cruel summer heat 

If flowers could talk, I repeat, they would make us 
blush because we have never learned to live as they do, 
in spite of our higher intelligence. Our emotions are 
struggling still with bristles that may not be death.

his clothes stinked with the odor 
of dried sweat and dirt. He was 
ugly to behold. 

His teeth were set firm as if try- 
ing to hold back the tears that 
were welling from his dulled eyes. 
His face was twisted with un- 
speakable pain. 

He had written only one line, 
yet his mind was shrieking with 
long pent-up emotions. He could 
not write them; hi3 fingers were 
trembling. 



Among the other Oriental “Envoys 
enipotenciary” in the Cairo conven- 
m were the Hon. Huan Naishi, 
)stmaster general of China; Dr. 
hang Hsin-Hai, minister plempo- 
mtiary of the Chinese Republic to 
'ortngai) Dr. Victor Hoo Chi-Tsar, 
L voy extraordinary and minister 
enipotentiary of China to Berne, 
Switzerland. 

The Egyptian kingdom recognized 
o important work of Mr* Cuader- 
who was the whole P» I. delega. 
on himself (China had 9 delegates), 
during the Congress, Mr. Cuaderno 
Lad to work almost daily from 8 p. 
n. to 3 a. m, to prepare for the 
session the following day. Of the 
measures favorably acted upon in 
that universal postal congress, 



“Yes, twenty years ago, little 
Teroy; ten years ago, hopeful To- 
roy! Where is your moon now ? 
Where are your dreams now? Yes, 
I have clung to illusions all my life. 
Life is an illusion, unreachable as 
the full moon of little Teroy. There 
was once a moon at the foot of an 



old balete tree; there was once a 
half -moon over our heads; there 
was once a doctor! Reality snatch- 
ed them from me. What is Real- 
ity? Back rent? Fruitless job- 
hunting? I am penniless, dirty, 
hungry, helpless, dying! That’s 
what I am. That is Reality! Real- 
ity. . . God!. . . O God!” 

He looked at his filthy surround- 
ing, at his ragged clothes; he felt 
his head burning. His hands were 
cold. 

“I have been cheated! I have 
been betrayed!” 

“God. . . forgive. . . ” 

The single line he had written 
on the sheet before him grew dim- 
mer and dimmer to his eyes. It

3- It will help the industrialization

5. It will gradually lead to the

English firms from the place of pro- 
duction to foreign markets.

With our monopoly of abaca and

we could not remain on a let-alone 
policy, but a collective action is ne- 
cessary to help this major industry- 






which Mr- Cuaderno worked actively 
with the other delegates for passage 
include (1) the reduction of 20 per 

cexA. ot the transit charges on closed 

mail, (2) the abolition of the transit 
charges of 5 centimes on each piece 
of mail matter sent in open mail, 
and (3) the abolition, of the ware- 
housing charge of 50 centimes pm 
sack of mail, which enabled the P. I 
government to save around P14,UW 
on such charges every year. There 
were 1,600 propositions submitted 
for consideration by the delegates. 

Explaining his case to Floor Lead- 
er Jose Ozamis of the National As- 
sembly, Mr. Cuaderno wrote partly 



as follows: 

The medals awarded during the 
closing session of the Postal Con- 
gress at the Abdin Palace, when the 
Ants were signed, were of different 

orders or rank. As I could not ac- 
cept the award at the time, or with- 
out previous authority, 1 failed to 
get the order of the medal awarded 

The late King Fuad I, father of 
the present Egyptian ruler, gave the 
awards. 

Mr. Cuaderno was fully empower- 
ed by the P- I. government to take 
part in all the deliberations of the 
Universal postal congress, vote, and 



sign conventions, agreements, and 
protocols and they actually signed 
the acts drawn by his fellow envoy S|j j 
plenipotentiary. 

* * * 

P RIVATE citizens of the Philip* 
pines receiving foreign decora- 
tions are many. Even before Amer* 
ica planted its flag in the Philip* 
pines, Filipinos received foreign de, 
corations now and then from man} 
lands, particularly Spain, which, be 
- fore the present war and revolution, 
honored the Filipino Manila-to* 
Madrid fliers, Juan Calvo and Anto- 
nio Arnaiz, with fitting decorations. 
The Commonwealth Government also 
authorized the President of ^ the 
Philippines to bestow decorations, 
upon these two intrepid aviators in 
recognition of their epochal ^ ea V| 
The Honorable Mariano Jesus Cuefl | 
co, secretary of Public Works and 
Communications, is the holdor of tu© 

coveted papal medal, Pro 

Ecclesia et Pontifice . So are Dona 
Sergia Valle of Cebu and a dozen 
other Filipinos. A mayor in Minda- 
nao, Santiago Artiaga, is also the 
holder of a beautiful decoration from 
a foreign government in recognition 
of his services while acting mayor 
of the City of Manila. 

Most of the foreign decorations 
conferred upon Filipinos are in re- 
cognition of military service and 
religious work.

IT'S LOVE I'M AFTER 

Dedicated to Carmen Raymundo of 
Balagtas by F. Cruz; to Mercing of Al- 
hambra by M. Antonio; to Amparing by 
Augusto; to FehJ by Nena; to Auring 
by Siony; to Zita and Glory by Geling; 
to Angel by Belflor; to Miss Choleng 
Agtistin of R.B.C., by Pedring Reyes, 

Most books inspire a great 
ambition 

To gain position and fame, 

I’ll reach the goal I seek without 
books, 

All other outlooks are tame, 

It’s love I’m after. 

I don’t want to be a millionaire. 
The only thing on the earth for 
which I care is love, 

For love and laughter, 

I’d give ev’ry thing that I possess. 
The perfect synonym for 
happiness is love, 

Rich men, poor men, beggar 
men, * 

Thieves, feel the way I do. 
Because each one of them believes 
He’ll find somebody like you, 

It’s love I’m after 
It mav make me rise or make me 
fall, 

But it’s love I’m after. 



WITH ALL MY HEART 

Heartily dedicated to Miss Cristi del 
Rosario by Pepito ; to Miss Couching 
Eliescas by M.D.L. 

With all my heart I say 
I love you dearly, 

For I am yours sincerely 
With all my heart, 

With all my heart, without a why 
or wherefore, 

You’re all I’ll ever care for, 

With all my heart. 

And if I were lyrical, I would 
write a song, 

Telling of the miracle, the day 
you came along, 

And every night I’ll tell 
the stars above me, 

To say again I love you, 

With all my heart. 



TEARS IN MY HEART 

< Requested by Margarita del Mundo 
Especially for Amparing C. Salazar.) 

Tears in my heart, 

O how my soul cries for you! 

I’m just a poor broken-hearted. 
Tears in my heart, 

What lonely nights I live through ! 
My empty arms call for you. 
Once there were moonbeams 
That used to dance around my . . 
..heart; 

Now I here storms clash 
A lightning flash, and a thunder 
crash . . . 

O where can there be 
Another love just for me 
To change all these tears in my 
heart to joy. 



ONCE IN A WHILE 

Dedicated to Ey Ey Si of SPESTA

Once in a while, 

"Will you try to give one tittle 
thonght to me, 

Though someone else may be, 
Nearer your heart, 

Once in a while, 

Will you dream of the moment 
I shared with you, 

Moments before we two, 

Drifted apartP 3 *' 

In loves smouldering ember, 

One spark may remain, 

If love still can remember, 

The spark may remain, 

I know that I’ll 
Be contented of yesterday’s 
memories, 

Knowing you’ll think of me, 
Once in a while. 



MY HEART IS YOURS 

Dedicated to Miss Siemang Lim by 
Pedring Francisco ; to Miss Rcmy Re- 
yes by Fely Francisco. 

Love for you was born In me, 
We are tied in destiny, 

My heart is j r ours, 

Though the deepest seas run dry 
Though the stars desert the sky 
I shall never sigh, 

Although weVe parted , 

Because my heart is yours, * 

They say that love is a flower, 
That bloom's an hour or two; 

But I will be in your power,

The one I love, 

Is coming along some day, 

And I ha,ve none except the one 
I love, 

She may be near, 

Or ever so far away, 

But I have not, except the one 
I love, 

And though our meeting 
It left to chance 
Until our meeting I still 
Will keep our dream-romance 
And thru the night I prayed

Ferrer of Agusan by Phil . Roqueflor ; to 
Cristina Guanzon by Versing; requested

Romance in the dark with you, 
All at once I know darling 
love was near, 

I thrilled to my finger tips, 

I could feel your lips, 
darling on so near. 

The music was so entrancing 
the lights all began to fade,, 

I said to myself “keep dancing” 
only my heart obeyed, 

A flame flew from just a spark 
when 1 found 

Romance in the dark with you.

Tonight, we love, tonight with you,

And gaze with delight at you, 
Tonight we love, 

I’m yours, you’re mine, 

We know the meaning of the

To please be kind 
And find the one I love. 



rpHERE is no question that Dr. 

-I Lin’s book has charm. In fact. 
It fairly oozes with it. One can well 
Imagine American club-women 
rolling their eyes in ecstasy after 
reading it through and sighing: 
“How marvellous!” I am not exag- 
gerating, but I believe that Dr. 
Lin’s book will be the talk of this 
year in the various women’s club 
meetings throughout America, for 
it is exactly the sort of book that 
would appeal to women — in parti- 
cular, American women. 

One might even say that it is 
essentially a feminine book: it Is 
the kind of wisdom derived from 
intuition rather than from intel- 
lect. In short, Dr. Lin does not 
make the pretense of being an 
academic rnd systematic philoso- 
pher, and one is not surprised at 
that either, knowing very well that 
Dr. Lin is an avowed admirer of 
vvv:\t, great mad genius, Nietzsche. 

Personally, I must say that I, 
too, like Dr. Lin's book immensely. 

\\, \s very Yea<Xaifc>\e*, 
and readability everyone knows, 

•». virtue that one would hesitate 
to ascribe to many books. Dr. Lin 
is always so Interesting that al- 
though one may not agree with 
everything he says, one neverthe- 
less is always impressed by the 
way he says it. in fact, reading 
him is not unlike listening to some 
Wonderful conversationalist" fie

choice of diction, so much so that 
one is almost willing to concede 
that whatever he says must make 
sense. 

Dr. Lin says, for example, that 
the trouble with the world at the 
present time is that people do not 
have enough leisure, and that if 
they only knew how to enjoy them- 
selves properly, not only their per- 
sonal problems, but all social pro- 
blems would be solved. Now, If 
such a statement had been made 
by a serious student of the social 
sciences, one would immediately 
cry out: “ Bosh and nonsense;” 

but as it came from Or. lAn’s pen, 
oiae is perhaps not so sure that It 
may not have been right after all. 

M * * 

D R. Lin calls himself an Epicure- 
an, and Epicureanism, in his 
opinion, is far from being a bad 
philosophy of life, if It Is only un- 
derstood correctly. To quote: 

“He who preaches any kind of 
doctrine must be prepared to be 
misunderstood, as the Epicures tu- 



ple fail to see the essential kind- 
ness of spirit of a Stoic, like Mar- 
cus Aurelius, and how often the 
Epicurean doctrine of wisdom and 
restraint has been popularly con- 
strued as the doctrine of the man 
of pleasure! It will at once be 
brought up against this somewhat 
materialistic view of things, that 
it is selfish, that it lacks totally a 
sense of social responsibility, that 
it teaches one to enjoy one’s self 
merely. 

“This type of argument proceeds 
from ignorance; those who use it 
know not what they are talking 
about. They know not the kind- 
ness of temper of such a lover of 
life. Love of one’s fellowmen 
should not be a doctrine, an ar- 
ticle of faith, a matter of Intellec- 
tual conviction, or a thesis sup- 
ported by arguments. The love of 
mankind which requires reasons is 
no true love. This love should be 
perfectly natural, as natural for 
man as for the birds to flap their

I ve tried to seek expression. 

For this desire I fee! 

You’ve made a very deep

Let me confess what I feel for you

Or go to most any extreme. 

This is my true confession, 

I swear by the stars above 
And now you’re in complete

Of my secret love.

You took the words right out c

And it was like a bolt from th

You took the words right out c

When you said “I love you” 

I stood in a daze awhile 

For I felt that way too, 

The moment I saw you smile 

I heard the words and you in 
my heart, 

There wasn’t room enough for 
two 

You took the words right out c 
my heart, 

And left only room for you.

Nature. No man who loves the 
trees truly can be cruel to animals 
or to his fellowmen. 

“In a perfectly healthy spirit, 
gaining a vision of life and of 
one’s fellowmen and a true and 
deep knowledge of Nature, kind- 
ness is the natural thing. That 
soul does not require any philo- 
sophy or man-made religion to 
tell him to be kind. It is because 
his spirit has been properly nour- 
ished through his senses, some- 
what detached from the artificial 
learning of human society, that he 
is able to retain a true mental and 
moral health. We cannot, there- 
fore, be accused of teaching unself- 
ishness (?) when we are scratch- 
ing off the earth and enlarging 
the opening from which this spring 
° kindness will naturally flow.”
