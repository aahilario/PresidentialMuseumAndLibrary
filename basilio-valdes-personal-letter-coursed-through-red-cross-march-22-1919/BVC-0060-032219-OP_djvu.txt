Dear Mr .Valdes: 

I want to notify you that I hare been called up on 
the telephone last Sunday, March 16th, from Coblenz, but I do not' v 
by whom because the connection was very poor. Last Sunday Evening 
I received a telegram of the following contents: 

"Can you give date when you can take Alice to Carson Hotel 
at Hannover - we will meet you there and get her send answer 
to American Red Cross Coblenz = Mr .G.J. Pratt "

On March l?th I sent an urgent wire to the American Red 
Cross Cbblenz, worded as follows: 

"request power of attorney signed personally by Mr .Mercer be- 
fore I will take final steps for departure of my niec«e Alice 
Mercer. Have explained my reasons in letter of March 14th to 
American Red Cross Berl in" 

To-day a messenger from the local post office called on 
me who was paying me back the money for this wire and handing me 
over a rotofication that the French authorities in Mainz did not 
let this telegram pass through to Coblenz. To-day I have received 
word from the Royal Spanish Embassy in Berlin that they request 
a picture and personal description for passport for ray nie^e 'Alice 
Mercer. I will have these things made ready and sent off oiji Mon- 
day. — I "ow want to ask you, dear Mr.Vald4s, to kindly lijjt'me
