or favoring labor against anybody regardless of whether 
lie is right oi not. Social justice does not mean dis- 
possessing the rich' of his lawful property and 'dis-

justice, in other wcrds, does not mean communism. So- 
justice moans exactly that; — social justice. 11 .

every constituent element in the community. When a question 
is before us, we oust -not consider whether that question 
involves this class of society or that class, or whether it 
involves this individual or that individual; -for every question

"In the Philippines, the stage is set and the time 
opportune for organizing our society upon the basis of 
social justice . . • . 

"It is unfortunately true that there are some capi- 
talists and landowners who would deny labor its due. tfut 
I believe they constitute a very small minority and they 
can be whipped into line, if they cannot be convinced

}\ THE NEED FOR AvSQClAL JUSTICE 

"To insure the accomplishment of this task of national 
spiritual reconstruction, we shall formulate and adept social 
code — a code of ethics and personal conddot-— a . written Bushido 
that can he explained in .the schools, preached from the pul- 
pit s, and tai*shivin the streets and plazas, and in the remotest 
corners of our' land, We shall indoptrinate eyery man, woman, 
and child in its precepts* - By every means and. power at my 
command, I shall strive to enforce its principles and to re- 
quire that they be so universally said constantly, observed, 
that our children may breathe it in the air and feel it in 
their flesh. Every Filipino is a part and en objective of 
tliis great national movement, the success of which depends 
upon his own success in building u P his character and develop- 
ing his faculties'." .
