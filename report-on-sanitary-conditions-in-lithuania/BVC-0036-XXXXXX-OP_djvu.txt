REPOPT ON SANITARY CONDITIONS IN LITHUANIA.. 
Climate of Lithucxnla. 



The climate ia vary cold in winter, arid vary warm in summers 
In spring and autumn the temperature changes considerably, ag it is 
warm out in the sun and quite cool at night . These abrupt changes 
in the temperature, cause a good deal of pneumonias Summer cornea 
very quickly, ia very warm, and lasts a short time. 



Sanitation ar.i hygiene. 




* 

The largest town we visited was Kowno, which is actually the 
seat of the government of the Lithuanian Republic© This city , of 
a population of abt» 50,000 is quite dirty© The 3 is no system of 
sewers, and the water and dirt is removed by shallow and insufficient 
canal a a The streets are dusty and no steps are taken to remedy it« 

' n * is hard, and is obtained from wolls, no system of 

pipes existingo The same water ia used both for washing and drinking 
purposes*. No chemical or bacteriological analysis have been made 
since the -war© 



Excreta a Garbage and wastes. 



The garbage and wastes are taken away from the city to the 
country ana usod for filling purposes or burrisd underground? The 
water closets are bad as no sewers exist 0 They ail empty into under- 
ground deposits, which are cleaned about once a year* Sorse of these 
deposits are made of cement $ but others are not, and naturally a 



great deal of the excreta filters through & and probably mixes with 
th water® The excreta when removed from these deposits is taken 
to the farm* and used as fertilizer 0 

Soil o 

The soil is blacky heavy and very rich for agriculture „ In 
certain parts, ho waver, it i3 sandy a 

Hatalitv. 

The birth rate up- to the war was from 27 to 33 per thousand o 

r 

This rate however, has diminished during the war* 

Mortality . 

Before the war the mortality was between 16 and 23 per thousand,, 
a rate which the war increased by its consecutive privations in 
food* and difficulty of medical attentions. A large percentage of 
the population dived in 1917 during an epidemic of dysentary« In the 
last epidemic of typhus which occurred recently the death rata ,aa 
high, but this has decreased and although there are yet some cases,, 
the death rate from typhus ia actually from 5 to 10 percent® 

Morbidity., 



« 




The diseases which prevail md cause a large number of victims 
are typhus and dysentery,, both of than appearing separately in the 
form of lari..e epidemics® The typhus usually appears in spring and 
auimi.er and the dysentery in winter® There exists a lar ;e number 
of cases of tubercular adtnitis of the neck,, due to un&rraitrition 
and unsanitary conditions of living® Tho people live in email 
wooden houses t with very poor ventilation* There is prevalent a 
small number of akin diseases,, caused by the lack of aoap^ and dirty 
clothing® 



Hospital facilities 

In Kowno there are live hospitals., as follow* s Sivil hospital, 
Jewish hospital. Red Cross Hospital Ho«l, Red Cross Hospital No* 2, 
and the Military Hospital# 

Civil Hospital o It is the largest in the tscm, and contained 210 patients,

50 cases of typhus, carefully isolated in a part of the hospital, 
to which only doctors and certain personal! had access o The staff 
co dieted of 4 doctors, eight nurses and an assisting personnel 
of 4S3o 

The hospital building was good and the wards were clean 
and ventilated, with good room space between the beds* The bedding

was good and with sufficient light* It was cleanly kept* 

Jewish Hospital* This is a small hospital with a capacity of 120 beds* 

They only had 45 patients, as they could not provide the other beds 
with liiA^n® The building is located in tho Jewish part of the 
town and the interior was very dirty and filthy* The wards were 
overcrowded and with absolutely no ventilation, the windows 
being kept constantly closed. The only .art of this institution 
which was partially satisfactory was the b: thing and delouaing 
rooms There were 30 cases of typhus all isolated in poorly 
ventilated and dirty wards© The principal personnel consists 
of two doctors and three nurses* 

Red Sfross Hospital Ko 0 lo This piace has a capacity of 150 beds, 

and is by far the cleanest and be3t hospital in Kowno. It is uoad 
exclusively for a ck and wounded Lithuanian soldiers© inere were

these 30 were surgical cases and 70 medical*, including 20 cases 
oi typhus which were properly isolated* The operating room was 
small and with poor light* They needed an autoclave and a boiler

There is no scarcity of food but this can only be obtained 
by money, and: naturally the poor people do not get. the amount they should 
There is no system of rationing* Heat, milk, eggs and butter can 
easily be obtained but are very expansive* a fact which makes it lm= 
possible for the poor class to provide themselves with these supplies*
