  <description>Foreword reads:&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"The present study collects and compiles the Commonwealth statutes affecting the Philippine Army. Some of the important executive orders, and other legal sources are also contained in it. Amendments to the National Defense Act are found in such widely scattered sources that the compilation of the law in its present form, incorporating all amendments, will serve as a reference to the legal basis of the Army. A list of executive messages and important speeches of the President of the Commonwealth relating to national defense and the Army is also included. A short account of the establishment of the Army, its development and organization has been written."&lt;/div&gt;</description>
