Marines Invade After 
3-Day Bombardment; 
No Naval Resistance 



GUAM, Feb. 20 — American Ma- 
rines have won a solid 4,500-yard 
beachhead on Iwo Jima island in 
the Volcanos, 750 miles from Tokyo. 
The troops stormed ashore Monday 
after the island had been subjected 
to four days of terrific bombard- 
ment by thousands of carrier places 
and the guns of the largest war 
fleet in history. 

Pacific Fleet headquarters an- 
nounced that the veteran Fifth 
Corps Marines drove inland to the 
edge of one of the island's airfields 
under increasing Japanese artillery 
and mortar fire. Admiral Chester 
Nimitz said the American casual- 
ties have been "moderate." 

An hour before announcing the 
invasion of the 8-square mile island, 
the Navy released details of the U. 
S. carrier plane attack on Tokyo 
last Friday and Saturday. Admi- 
ral Nimitz described the operation 
as a "great and decisive" victory. 
Our carrier planes scored "com- 
plete tactical surprise" and des- 
troyed 332 Jap planes in combat, 
177 on the ground, and at least 
150 others probably destroyed or 
damaged, on the first day alone. 
At least 32 enemy vessels were 
sunk, and hangars and aircraft 
factories were damaged. Our 
losses were 59 planes, but none of 
the U. S. ships was damaged by 
enemy action. 

The invasion is one of the tough- 
est jobs undertaken by the Marine 
-Corps, and eye-witnessi accounts 
said the enemy was putting up stiff 
resistance. The troops s^arned 
ashore from hundreds ..of. landing 
craft, after 8,000 rockets had 
lashed the beaches. 

Thus far the Japanese navy has 
shown no sign it will attempt to 
relieve the embattled garrison of 
the island. Correspondents return- 
ing ffom flights with U. S. war- 
planes reported not a Jap plane 
was sighted over Iwo. 

Domei, the Japanese propaganda 
agency, reported that American 
warships ringing Iwo Jima poured 
. shells into the island from virtually 
every point on. the -compass Sunday, 
in concert with heavy aerial bomb- 
ing. Domei claimed heavy damage 
to the attacking force, but went on 
to state it is regrettable "we can- 
not say we have affected the fight- 
nig strength of the enemy as a 
whole." 



B-29's Hit Tokyo 



WASHINGTON — With the 
American carrier force apparently 
withdrawn from the Tokyo area 
to supplement the force covering 
the Marine invasion of Iwo Jima, 
B-29 Superfortress bombers on 
Sunday attacked the enemy capital 
again. The War Department made 
the announcement, and Tokyo said 
about 100 planes participated in 
the assault. 



Argentina Warns Nazis 

BUENOS AIRES— The Foreign 
Office warned the German govern- 
ment over the weekend to release 
seven Argentine diplomats, or face 
a declaration of war. Germany had 
refused safe conduct to the diplo- 
mats, now in Sweden, because of 
a British refusal to grant safe con- 
duct to German state officials from 
Lisbon. 

"If the German government in- 
sists on putting into practice this 
threat," declared Acting Foreign 
Minister CesdV Ameghino, "the 
Argentine government will consi- 
der that action ... a hostile act." 



1,600 U.S. Bombers Hit 
At Germany; Russ Stalled 

In one of the most widespread 
attacks since last summer 1,600 
American bombers operating in 
"wolf packs" of 100 smashed at 
least a dozen widespread transpor- 
tation and industrial targets Mon- 
day throughout Western Germany, 
dropping over 3,300 tons of ex- 
plosives and fire bombs. 

On the Western Front, Canadian 
and British Armies expanded their 
break in the SJegf.ied Line at the 
northern ■ end around Goch, and 
pushed toward the rolling Ruhr 
Valley. ^ * . 

In Eastern Germany, Russian 
forces still were stalled on the Oder 
River line between Frankfurt and 
Kustrin, but powerful columns to 
the southeast increased pressure m 
the mounting offensive along the 
Czechoslovak border in Silesia and 
Brandenburg provinces. 

Senate Peace Plan 

NEW YORK— The U. S. Senate 
will support an international orga- 
nization to maintain peace, as 
aSed upon at the Crimean confe- 
ffnS by Marshal Stalin, President 
rence uy » prime Minister 

g£££ sSlor Robert F Wag- 
S of New York declared here. 



American troops, operating un- 
der a canopy of heavy artillery 
fire, have reduced the Japanese 
toehold on South Manila to an area 
"approximately 1200 by 800 yards" 
as the "bitterest fighting conti- 
nues," General MacArthur an- 
nounced Wednesday. 

He also announced that enemy 
casualties in the six weeks cam- 
paign on Luzon now have mounted 
to over 92,000. Our own casualties 
stand at 2,676 killed, 245 missing, 
and 10,008 wounded, a total of 
12,929 men. 

On Corregidor, American shock 
troops continued the destruction of 
remaining enemy strong points 
around the fringes of the island, 
using flamethrowers and explosives 
to clean out hundreds of small 
caves and tunnels. 

The Japanese were resisting sa- 
vagely from behind the towering 
walls of Intramuros in the south 
section of Manila near the Pasig. 
There was no visible sign of life 
within the walls. Most of the 
buildings hav^ been destroyed or 
badly damaged. What is left of the 
Jap garrison is in a desperate 
plight. 

Troops of the 37th Division 
gained another three blocks in the 
Ermita district, and cleared the 
area from the Philippine General 
Hospital to the bayfront. The 37th 
also captured Santa Teresa college 

Gen. MacArthur Recalls 
the Heroes of Bataan 

General Douglas MacArthur, 
commenting on the recovery of Ba- 
taan and Corregidor by American 
troops, said Monday: 

"Bataan, with Corregidor the ci- 
tadel of its integral defense, made 
T)0; sible all that has happened 
since. History, ! am sure, will re- 
cord it as one of the decisive battles 
of the world. Its long protracted 
struggle enabled the United Na- 
tions to gather strengh to resist in 
the Pacific. Had it not held out, 
Australia would have fallen with 
incalculably disastrous results. 

"Our triumphs of today belong* 
equally , to that dead army. Its 
heroism and sacrifice have been 
fully acclaimed, but the great stra- 
tegic results, of that mighty de- 
fense are only now becoming fully 
apparent. The Bataan eamson 
was destroyed due to its dreadful 
handicaps but no army in history 
more thoroughly accomplished its 
mission. Let no man henceforth 
speak of it other than as of mag- 
nificent victory. 



and the German club, after heavy 
fighting. 

Just outside the walled city, 37th 
Division infantry were advancing 
across the rubble and wreckage to 
close a trap on isolated enemy units 
entrenched in the Manila Ice Plant 
and the Postoffice, near the foot 
of the Jones Bridge. Both strong- 
points were under strong artillery 
and mortar fire. 

General MacArthur, in his Wed- 
nesday communique, issued another 
indictment of Japanese brutality 
exhibited in the Manila fighting. 
He said: "He is acting with the 
igreatest savagery in his treatment 
of non-combatant and private prop- 
erty. A survey of Manila shows 
that practically all private posses- 
sions of any value were thoroughly* 
looted during the period of enemy 
occupation and apparently shipped 
to Japan." 

South of Manila, units of the 
First Cavalry and the 11th Air- 
borne divisions entered Fort Mo- 
Kinley, but fighting continues in 
the area. Elsewhere, the 11th Air- 
borne southeast of Laguna de Bay, 
in conjunction with Philippine 
guerrillas, surrounded an enemy 
force at Mabato Point, after seiz- 
i ing Tagig. To the east, MacAr- 
thur's forces were probing enemy 
postions on the Marikina River 
line. 

Light naval forces continued pa- 
trolling Manila Bay, and arc 
sweeping mines from the entrances. 
Clark Lee, International News 
Service correspondent, sailed close 
to Fort Hughes, Fort Drum, and 
Fort Frank, and reported he saw 
no sign of life on the small islands, 
although it is believe there is a con- 
siderable Jap force on Fort 
Hughes. 

Elsewhere in the Philippines, 
attacks were continued on Negros 
and Mindanao. Light naval units 
shelled towns on the southeast coast 
\egros, and air patrols hit sup- 
ply dumps near Bacolod. On Min- 
danao, our fighter dropped 38 tons 
of bombs on Licanan airdrome near 
Davao. 

Far to the west, strong attacks 
were made on airdromes and indus- 
trial centers on Formosa, setting 
off numerous explosions in factory 
buildings and storage tanks. In 
addition, 15 locomotives and 50 cars 
were destroyed. One small freigh- 
ter was sunk and another damaged 
off French Indp-China. 

The daily round of assaults con- 
tinued on bypassed enemy posi- 
tions on Borneo,* Celebes, the Mo- 
luccas, the Lesser Sundas, New 
Guinea, and the Blsmark-Solomons 
area.

Our Morning 

Japanese savagery rea-ched 
its climax in Manila when the 
remnants of Yamashita*s de 
featcd army went berserk, de 
strayed the city and murdered 
helpless civilians. Nothing 
has seared hatred against the 
Japanese in the Filipino heart 
more deeply than seeing oui 
capital city converted into a 
funeral pyre by Japanese fa 
natics, whose unspeakable 
monstrosity is without paral- 
lel in the history of warfare. 

But just as the Japanese 
terrorism and brutality of 
nearly three years failed to 
cow the Filipinos into submis- 
sion, so this latest dastardly 
act of the Japanese soldiery 
will not weaken the people's 
determination to continue 
fighting until the enemy is 
completely vanquished, and 
every Japanese soldier ex- 
pelled from Philippine soil — 
or put under it. 

For, while physically Manila 
has been destroyed, spiritual- 
ly the city is emerging from 
darkness into the light of a 
new world of freedom, demo- 
cracy and security. The vic- 
tory of American arms in Ma- 
nila has ended the long night 
of Filipino captivity, and the 
whole country is alight with 
the glory of liberation.

Marines Take Iwo Jima 
Airfield Drive Ahead 
Against Jap Defenses 

GUAM — With strong air and 
fleet gunfire support, American 
Marines seized the southern air- 
field on Iwo Jima Tuesday, Pacific 
Hieet headuarters announced. 

Admiral Nimitz said the Marines 
smashed through Japanese defenses

and, which is in the center of the 
Volcano group, 750 miles from 
rokyo. 

The U. S. invasion fleet con

Civilians Warned to Stay 
Out of Ft. McKinley A rea 



Filipinos were warned yesterday 
to stay away from the Fort Mc- 
Kinley area in south Manila. Hun- 
dreds of leaflets dropped in the 
district by the Psychological War- 
fare unit of the First Cavalry Div- 
ision told civilians to stop the prac- 
tice of picking up equipment left 
in the area. The warning was 
prompted by a disruption in com- 
munications at Fort McKinley 
caused when Filipinos cut and 
carried away sections of wire being 
used by signal units. 

The leaflets, printed i n English 



and Tagalog, said: "Fort McKin 
ley is now under the control of 
the United States Army. 

"The Army is busy cleaning up 
the remaining Jap stragglers in 
and about the fort. 

"All Filipinos are forbidden tc 
enter the fort area or grounds. 

"The* practice of walking through 
the grounds and picking up what- 
ever you see must stop immediate- 
ly. 

"Heed this warning and protect 
yourself by staying out of the 
grounds of Fort McKinley until 
further notice. ,,

Americans Favor World 
Security Organization 

NEW YORK — A majority of 
Americans as long ago as two 
years approved the basic isues re- 
affirmed at the recent Crimea con- 
ference by Roosevelt, Churchill and 
Stalin, according to Dr. George 
Gallup, director of the American 
Institute of Public Opinion. 

Dr. Gallup on Tuesday discussed 
the "widespread favorable reac- 
tion" in the United States to the 
decisions announced after the meet- 
ing of the three chief Allied lea- 
ders. He said that popular support 
had long been particularly strong 
for the unconditional surrender po- 
licy, and immediate formation of 
a world security organization. 

Even in 1943, the survey director 
reported, three out of four Amer- 
icans favored starting the forma- 
tion immediately of a world peace 
organization, and supported the 
Ball resolution which would have 
put the Senate on record in favor 
of a world police force.

Tuesday the heroic stand of Amer- 
icans and Filipinos on Bataan and 
Corregidor in 1942 "contributed a 
breathing spell vital to Australia." 

"Gen. MacArthur's tribute to the 
men who died in those campaigns is 
one which we share, Curtin dec- 
lared. This brings us to remember 
those men whose lives have been 
sacrificed in delaying and holding 
back the enemy's thrust and for- 
ward movements directed against 
us in a global war, at a time when 
w were weak and not ready. Time

Progress Slow Due 
To Desire To Limit 
Civilian Casualties 

American units, taking everv 
precaution to limit civilian casual- 
ies, are proceeding slowlv in thpir 
methodical reduction of eSiySS 
nants m South Manila, but on Ba- 
taan and Corregidor, General Mac- 
Arthur & assault forces have writ- 
en a swift finish to the opera- 
ions. 1 

ri" h ,H, C0 A mn J unic * ue Thursday, 
general MacArthur announced that 
the Japanese in south Manila have 
been contracted into the old walled 
Clt y ~ an area approximately 700 
yards by 500 yards. 

The First Cavalry division drove 
north of the Army-Navy Club, 
captured the Burnham Green area 
west of Wallace Field, and fought 
from the first to the second floor 
of the Manila hotel, against stiff 
opposition. 

Units of the 37th Division, 
fighting from house to house, are 
closing on Intramuros from the 
east They seized the Ermita Nor- 
mal school southwest of the Fili- 
pino YMCA building taken yester- 
day. 

To the north, 37th Division in- 
fantry cleared an entire block, ad- 
vancing to the Quezon bridge south 
of the Pasig. 

General MacArthur emphasized 
that "progress has been slow due 
to the desire to limit civilian ca- 
sualties as far as possible." 

"It is in no sense a measure of 
the special skill or tenacity of the 
enemy whose savage barbarism has 
seldom been displayed in a more 
repulsive form. The enemy units 
mainly involved are Japanese Ma- 
rines and Japanese naval defense 
forces." 

On Corregidor, Thursday's com- 
munique announced the virtual end 
of the lightning six-day campaign, 
with the enemy garrison "practi- 
cally destroyed." Our amphibious 
forces already have bujied over 
1700 Japanese dead, with the count 
only partially completed. Only 
isolated remnants, noled up in 
caves, now remain to be mopped 
up. 

On Bataan, the story was the 
same- So far as can be found, Gen- 
eral MacArthur announced, "no 
living Japanese soldier is now on 
the peninsula." Bagac on the west- 
ern coast of Bataan was occupied, 
and American forces have finished 
combing the area for enemy strag- 
glers. All other sectors through- 
out Luzon were described as 
"quiet" 

In other areas of the Philippines,

tacked airdromes on Negros, enemy

High Prices 

Many Manila residents are ad 
mitedly having trouble obtaining 
sufficient food now, due to infla- 
tionary conditions during the Jap 
occupation, the subsequent enemy 
destruction of food stocks, and cur- 
rent military demands on trans- 
port. The situation will be relieved 
as quickly as possible, through the 
efforts of the Army and PCAU. 

But meanwhile, black marketers 
are taking advantage of conditions 
to get rich quickly by selling scarce 
food at high prices. The authori- 
ties are determined to end this 
abuse, and it is to the public's inte- 
rest to aid them. 

The best aid the average resident 
can render is to refuse to buy at 
prices above the official ceilings. 
Names of the price violators should 
also be reported to the nearest 
PCAU officer, who will see tliat 
disciplinary steps are taken. 

Army Construction Jobs 
Relieving Unemployment 

The stevedoring, construction, 
and transportation projects of the 
U. S. Army in Luzon's liberated 
provinces are relieving unemploy- 
ment conditions among the civilian 
population. 

Recruiting offices of the Army 
Service Command Labor Offices in 
Dagupan and the Lingayen Gulf 
area have employed at least 10,000 
workers, mostly devoted to port 
and construction projects. 

The officers of the Philippine 
Civilian Affairs Unit, better known 
as PCAU, located in strategic 
towns of the liberated provinces, 
have employed many thousands 
more Filipinos to help carry out 
the relief and welfare program of 
the Philippine welfare section. 
Employment in Manila itself is in- 
creasing daily. 

Japs Resorting To Fuel 
Made from Potatoes 



Food Prices Sky-rocket Hera 
As Speculators Ignore Rates 



Tokyo propagandists who used to 
speak in glowing terms of the pe- 
troleum riches at Japan's command 
in the southern regions have re- 
cently been discussing the possibil- 
ity of securing aviation fuel from 
potatoes, indirectly admitting that 
Japan can no longer depend on her 
sea lines to transport oil from the 
Indies to the Japanese homeland. 

A recent commentary on Radio 
Tokyo discussed substitute fuel 
from two billion cans of potatoes 
scheduled to be raised in Japan 
during the current year. 

Similarly, during Japan's three 
years in the Philippines, the is- 
lands experienced an acute short- 
age of sugar, despite the country's 
abundant sugar production, because 
the Jananese nonvertpd Riiivnr -fr^m 



Despite the pegging of food 
prices at control rates and the esta- 
blishment of PCAU centers in the 
liberated areas of Manila, the 
prices of food being sold to the 
public in many Manila stores are 
high above the official maximum 
price list. 

Rice, the people's main food, 
which has been officially set at .32 
per ganta is being sold in the open 
at P3.30 per ganta, an increase of 
almost 1,000 per cent. It means, 
a laborer working in the various 
Army projects in the liberated 
areas at P1.20 per day cannot af- 
ford to buy the principal compo- 
nent of his daily diet. 

Meat, officially pegged at .40 per 
kilo, sells at P8.00, in recently re- 
opened markets. This represents | 
an increase of two thousand per | 
cent. It also means that a laborer j 
whose wage has been officially f 



(fixed at F1.20 must work a wee. 
to be able to buy one kilo of meal 

An egg according to the o^ial 
ly announced price list costs .03 o 
.36 per dozen. Nowhere in the en 
tire city are eggs being sold at tna 
price. Actually they are being sole 
at .70 each. 

In the fires that have scorchec 
more than half of Manila, private 
food stocks were lost, making the 
food situation more acute. T /} ou " 
sands of people rendered destitute 
by the fires of Ermita, Paco and 
Malate are at present living 
through the help of friends. With 
the little money they have been 
able to save, present food prices 
are beyond their reach. 

Observers believe that prices can 
be brought down to officially set 
levels by adopting strong measures 
against profiteers. 



Chinese Youth Corps 
Active Guerrilla Unit 



The Philippine branch of the San 
Min Chu.I Youth Corps, the offi- 
cial Chinese youth organization 
under the direct leadership of Gen- 
ralissimo Chiang Kai-Shek, with 
headquarter in Chungking and 
branches all over China and in 
important cities overseas, upon the 
Japanese occupation of the Philip- 
pines was immediately transformed 
into an effective guerilla unit. 

Commissioner Lin Tsao Mei, se- 
cretary-general of the corps as- 
sumed command under the assumed 
name of Commander Pei San. He 
was assisted by Mr. Cheng Ho-Fei, 
former Manila editor-in-chief of 
the Kuomintang newspaper, Kung 
Li Pao. The unit is known as the 
"Philippine Chinese Youth War- 
time Special Service Corps". With 
the victorious entry of the Amer- 
ican forces in Manila, the unit 
brought its activities into the open. 

For the last three years, the 
organization has taken the lead 
in organizing Chinese youths in the 
Philippines to combat the enemy, 
working underground. It has fur- 
nished valuable information and 
other aid to the USAFFE and 
other guerrilla units, and engaged 
in a number of open combats with 
the enemy. Some of its members 
lost their lives. 



Rice Shipments Increase 
When Trucks Available 

There are large quantities of 
rice available for shipment to Ma- 
nila to relieve the food shortage in 
the city, according to Col. George 
Mann of PCAU. Their transporta- 
tion, however, being held up by 
trucking difficulties. 

As soon as the military situation 
carry rice into the city in ever-in- 
permits, trucks will be released to 
creasing quantities, until there is 
enough for everyone, he said. 

The opening of Manila Bay by 
the capture of Bataan and Corre- 
gidor will go far to dispense with 
trucking in the transportation of 
supplies to the city. Supplies will 
come right into the harbor by 
ship. 

Pan American Meeting 

MEXICO CITY — Statesmen 
from every corner of the Americas 
are here to attend the opening 
February 21, of an inter- American 
meeting which diplomats believe 
will be the most important ever 
held. The meeting is to consider 
regular yearly meetings of all for- 
eign ministers of the 21 republics, 
a great increase in the power of 
the Pan American Union, and ins- 
titution of an American social and 
economic council. 



Former Guerrilla Men Joining 
American Merchant Ship Crews 



Not content with fighting the 
Japanese for over two years as 
guerrillas in the Free Hills, many 
Filipino patriots have dropped their 
bolos but are serving on American 
ships carrying troops and supplies 
through Far Eastern waters. The 
War Shipping Administration 
points out that many of these vo- 
lunteers are experienced sailors, 
having sailed on American vessels 
before the war.

Third of Iwo 
Island Now In 
Marines' Hands 

™£fJ^f ~* T lth approximately 
one-third of Iwo Jima now in 
American hands, three U. S. Ma- 
rine division are slowly forging* 
ahead against bitter opposition to- 
ward the northern end of the island 
only 750 miles southeast of Tokjro. 

Marine forces reached the sum- 
mit of Mount Suribachi in the 
south, Admiral Nimitz revealed 
Saturday. This virtually ended all 
Japanese resistance in the lower 
third of Iwo, including one of three 
airfields. By Thursday, American 
casualties rose^ to more than 4,500 
killed and wounded, including 385 
dead. Heaviest fighting centered 
around airfield No. 2 in the middle 
of the island. 

A vivid picture of the ferocity 
which marks the battle for Iwo 
was given by Sergeant David 
Dempsey, a Marine combat corres- 
pondent who wrote: 

"The invasion beach of this is- 
land is the scene of indescribable 
wreckage — all of it ours. For two 
miles extending northward from 
the southern tip is a thick layer 
of debris. The wreckage of scores 
of boats testify to the price we paid 
to get our troops ashore, 1 he 
miracle is that we were ^le to 
supply our troops at all during the 
first two days/'

Posen m Western Poland and en-

day night* 

Capture of Posen carried reper- 
cussions which will be felt along 
the entire Eastern Front. Posen 
dominates the main east-west rail 
and highway routes between War- 
saw and Berlin, and had blocked 
the most direct pathway to the 
German capital. Over 25,000 Ger- 
man were captured in the battle 
for Posen, and another 25,000, in- 
luding the garrison commander, 
were killed. 

In the West two American ar- 
mies launched a new offensive in 
he center of the Siegfried Line, 
spearheaded by the U* S. Third 
\vhich advanced along a 5 5 -mile 
ector in the coal and steel pro- 
ducing Saar valley. For the 11th 
consecutive day, a fleet of 2,000 
American bombers spread devasta- 
tion Friday throughout the Reich, 
concentrating on factories and 
freight yards .

said Sunday, 

Nineteen enemy patrol boats of 
the "Q" class have been captured 
in operational condition. 

Troops of the First Cavalry 
and Sixth Infantry Divisions in 
new gains north of Marikina have 
driven within two miles of Mon- 
talban, 

MacArthur's troops have killed 
2,309 Japanese marine and naval 
forces defending Corregidor, and 
have closed 132 tunnels on the is-

WASHINGTON — Congress 
may soon transfer handling of

from the War Damage Corpora- 
tion to an agency winch will be 
empowered with clear *WP™fb£ 
Hy for provid.ng compensation for 
such damages regardless of the 
date on which any particular da- 
mage occurred. \ 

"War damage in tbe Philippine

in the inlands throughout the pe- 
riod of enemy attack, enemy occu- 
pation, and our inoccupation. 

"Since such compensation Will 
have a close connection with gen- 
eral relief and rehabilitation in the 
Philippines/' Klosaner continued 
"it may be that Congress will 
want the whole Philippine problem 
hand!ed by the Filipino rehabilita- 
tion Commission, the members to 
be appointed by the President and 
approved by the Senate. Again . 
war damage claims could be 
Hardfcd by an independent com- 
mission, or Congress might want 
it placed in the Interior Depart- 
ment." 

Klossner explained that the Taft 
bill, now before a Senate commit- 
tee, fails to include coverage of 
-lothing, household effects or grow- 
ing crops, and would make claims 
subject to review in Philippine 
courts. 



Guerrillas Aid 
Paratroopers In 
Bold Attack 



MacArthur's forces liberated 
another two thousand civilian in- 
ternees from Los Banos prison 
camp Friday in a daring rescue 
raid twenty-five miles inside enemy 
territory. The miss. on, one of th« 
most perfectly timed and coordi- 
nated of the Philippines campaign, 
was accomplished by a combined 
force of guerrJlas, paratroopers 
and amphibious troops. 

The entire Japanese garrison of 
243 officers and men, including the 
commander and his staff, was sur- 
prised at morning calesthenics and 
killed. 

The group of released internees, 
ncluding men, women and chil- 
dren of eight nationalities, num- 
bered 2,136 — the majority Amer- 
icans. Included were 300 British 
and smaller groups of Australians, 
Canadians, Dutch, Poles, Norwe- 
gians and Italians. 

Speaking of the Los Banos res- 
cue, General MacArthur said: 

"Nothing could be more satisfy- 
ing to a soldier's heart than this 
rescue, I am deeply grateful. God 
was certainly with us today." 

A special communique, released 
Saturday at MacArthur's head- 
quarters, described the liberation: 

"A carefully coordinated raid by 
the 11th Airborne Division of the 
XIV Corps and the Luzon guerril- 
las, under the overall command of 
Colonel Robert H. Soule, accom- 
plished the rescue. A selected de- 
tachment of the 511th Parachute 
Regiment, taking off from Nichols 
Field in Manila, made a parachute 
jump directly on the prison camp, 
fn the meanwhile, for several 
nights the guerrillas had been in- 
filtrating through the enemy's 
lines toward Los Banos and ele- 
ments of the Hth Division, the 
night before the attack, crossed 
Laguna de Bay in amphibious 
craft. 

"The Japanese guards were com- 
pletely surprised at morning ca* 
T erthenics and the commander, his 
tfaff and th^ entire garrison of 
133 were killed and their barracks 
burned, A defense cordon was im- 
mediately thrown around the cap- 
lives who were in units for morn- 
ing roll call. They were formed 
in columns, I't*cr cases on the am- 
tracks, and taken to the bay and 
transported to safety by amphi* 
bious craft. The covering force 
then withdrew to our lines. Our 
losses were two killed, two wounded 
and two internees slightly in- 
jured,"

Japanese are reported trying u* get 
into the PCAU, and be appointed

These men had trafficked freely

now they are trying to chisel into

their Japanese friends had done 
their best to level and destroy. 

There should be the most careful 
investigation of the records of the

for the retail posts. If former 
Japanese agents get into the "re-

Many U.S. Prisoners 
Die in Enemy Ships 

WASHINGTON— Eight hundred 
American prisoners suffocated in 
the packed holds of a Japanese 
prison ship which left Manila last 
December, according to a Navy 
officer who escaped- 

About 1,600 prisoners were her- 
ded into the tiny holds of the 
ship on the night of December 13, 
and were held there at the points 
of rifles for 36 hours- The vessel 
was sunk by an American bombing 
attack on December 15- 

This was the third known sink- 
ing of Japanese ships- carrying 
American prisoners. The first 
occured on September 7, when 83 
out of 760 American prisoners 
aboard the ship survived- On 
October 24 another prison ship was 
sunk and only five men were 
known to have survived out of 
1,800 prisoners aboard.

The Los Banos Coup 

For careful planning, daring 
execution and brilliant resuits i thib 
war offers few parallels to tfu 
rescue of 2,2UU American, British 
and other Allied intetrnees ;Von- 
tke Jj08 Baiios concentration camp 
last week* This achievement marks 
a new high in MacArtiiur's cam- 
paign to liberate the Philippines. 

As American paratroops drop- 
ped from tiie skies to annihilah 
the Jap garrison in the camp, hugt 
amphibious tractors came roaring 
put of Lagttna de Bay and smashes 
their way into the camp grounds. 
The internees and paratroops wen 
loaded into the amtraclcs which 
rolled back through enemy mackira 
gun fire to the edge of Laguna d< 
Bay, plunged into the water am. 
carried their cargo safely behind 
the American lines. Most astomid 
ing of all, the operation was car 
ried out with total military casual- 
ties of two dead and two wounded, 
while two internees were elightli 
wounded* 

"Nothing could be more satisfy- 
ing to a soldier's heart than thii 
rescue" General Mac Arthur said 
**! am deeply grateful. God wa* 
certainly with us today** 

The American and Filipino peo 
pie also are deeply grateful, grate 
ful for the organizing genius dnr 
efficient execution ivhich have sf 
mtccess fully defeated the Japanest

I/. S. War Mobilization 
At Completed Stage 

WASHINGTON — Despite an in 
crease of 1,500,000 in America'? 
armed forces in 1944 p the remain- 
ing civilian labor forces produced 
three percent more goods and serv- 
ices than in the preceding year. 

The Commerce Department an- 
nounced that during 1944, the 
United States reached a new high 
in utilization of manpower, with 
64 f O00,OOO persons 14 years of age 
or older employed. This includes 
nearly 12,000,000 in the armed 
forces. 

America's labor force today if 
abnormal in size, incident to the 
war. It includes 2,000,000 addi- 
tional young men 14 to 24 years 
old who have left school for mili- 
tary service or war work; 1,000,000 
additional young girls between 14 
and 19; 750,000 extra men 55 
years of age and older who have 
postponed retirement because of 
war's demands; and 2,500,000 wo- 
men aged 20 and over, mostly mar- 
ried and without young children, 
who have talcen war jobs. It is 
believed a large number of these 
will withdraw from the labor mar- 
ket after the war. 

Nevertheless, with the popula- 
tion now approximating 140,000,- 
000 f federal government agencies 
are studying post-war plans based 
on President Eosevelt's recom- 
mendation that 60,000,000 civilian 
jobs will be needed to maintain 
economic prosperity*

President Accepts Authority 
In Ceremony at^Malacanan 



President Sergio Osmena today 
took over the reins of civil gov- 
ernment from the military adminis- 
tration of General Mac Arthur in 
a brief, emotion-filled ceremony al 
svtalacanan Palace. 

Mr. Osmena in his acceptance 
speech called for unity among his 
people and immediate reestablish- 
:nent of the Commonwealth- Con- 
gress. He expressed hope that in 
impendence could be granted the 
Philippines on August L3, 1945, 
:he 47lh anniversary of Occupation 
Day. 

The ceremony, attended by Mrs. 
Osmena, Commonwealth officials 
and friends of the President ami 
ranking members of MacArthur's 
staff was held in the crystal-tiunfc 
reception hail of the presidential 
palace. The audience was visible 
moved by the drama of the affaii 
and there were tears in the eyes oi 
many — Filipinos and . Americans 
alike. Many of the men who left 
Corregidor and Bataan with Mac 
Arthur were also present. 

The ceremony began with thi 
ruffle of drums in the palace court 
yard following which Mrs. Osmena 
dressed in a beautiful green mestiz;. 
dress entered the reception hall on 
the arm of Major General Basilic 
Valdes, Philippine Army chief o; 
staff. Following Mrs. Osmena, tht 
President and MacArthur entered 
to a second burst of applause. 

General MacArthur made his ad 
dress in a restrained voice, packet, 
.with the emotion of his return t( 



the devastated city he loved. Dur- 
ing the last few words of his 
speech, the General's voice broke as 
he mentioned Manila. There were 
tears in his eyes as he said: 

"Your capital city, cruelly pun- 
nished though it be, has legamed 
its rightful plaice — Citadel ui De- 
mocracy in the East." 

President Usmena, clad in sol- 
dier's knaki without insignia, 
opened his address* saying* 

"Let us bow our heads in rever- 
ent memory of o ir sacred uead and 
die dead of our allies, whose lives 
are Uie forfeit that these, our lib- 
rties, might be restored. Let us 
pledge ourselves and all that is 
within us to the firm resolve to 
continue the tight with evory ounce 
of our Strength until the enemy 
shall have been completely van- 
quished." 

Genera) MacArthur, following 
the president's addiess, strode to 
drs. Osmena and gave her a re- 
bounding kiss, # saying: "l m so 
^lad you're home." He shook hands 
vitn Mr. Osmena and stepped 
quietly from the reception hall. 

The President and Mrs. Osmena 
in an informal reception accepted 
the congratulations of generals and 
soldiers, cabinet officials and civil- 
an well-wishers. The President was 
photographed shaking hands with 
dozens of old friends, among them 
Justice Luis P. Torres of the Court 
)f Appeals, his head bandaged 
Trom a Japanese bayonet wound.

nWfe, the Dutch, the English, a 
Ch.nose Pirate, our. ^vo uuonary 
fq Jiurs Kivu u vied with edCn 
J?hS and Shed blood for its yg- 
scs ion; because its , conquest has 
always meant the ttttiniate control 
of the entire arcnipeiajio. But to 
day's event is different from any 
of the previous conquests and vic- 
Ur.es. ihe present Victory of 
American arms is not a victoij 
for power, control or domination, 
out a victory fnf freedom, demo- 
craay and independence. 

In sharing with you today the 
exultation over the triumph ol 
American arms, let us bow out 
heads in reverent memory of oui

More than ever before, now that 
the rapid advance of our forces is 
widening its field of action, the 
government needs a united popu- 
ar support to enable it to under* 
ake successfully its tremendous 
tasks. Not by d.ssention and bick- 
erings, not by resort to violence 
^nd lawlessness can we serve the 
national interest. It would be tra* 
ris indeed if at this Vast stage of 
-iur crucial struggle for nation- 
hood, we should fall apart and be 
livided against ourselves. We 
have had enou h misfortunes and 
sufferings in this war; we cannot 
Jear any more. To plunge our- 
selves into the abyss of disunion

27 Filipino Flyers To 
U*S*d* For Re-Training 

SAN FRANCISCO — A group 
of £7 Filipino flyers who fought 
on the ground with guerrillas dur- 
ing three years of Japanese occu- 
pation of the Philippines have just 
returned to the United States for 
training on modern aircraft They 
last stepped into planes of pre- 
Pearl Harbor vintage. 

With no planes to fly, they 
acted as intelligence officers, 
transmitting v.tal information, and 
joining with guerrillas in attacks 
on Japanese communications, 
Their commander. Captain Napo- 
leon de Leon, 30-year-old veteran 
of the Bataan death march, acted 
as spokesman for the group. 

"I was imprisoned for three 
months, then released," he said. 
De Leon joined the guerrillas in 
the hills* They entered Japanese 
areas disguised as civilians, ga- 
thered information, and broadcast 
it to General MacArthur's head- 
quarters on a transmitter smuggled 
in by submarine. 

He produced a piece of Japanese 
currency bearing the signature of 
six Navy pilots who crashed near 
his camp. "For one month," he 
related, "they .ived with us. With 
their help we killed 12 Japanese 
and lank tfto enemy Uuachu/' 



Carrier Planes, 
B-29's Hit City 
Double Blow 



GUAM— Tokyo was subjected to 
its heaviest raid of the war Sunday 
A 'hen large forces of American 
Navy carrier bombers and giant 
3-29 Super Fortresses teamed up 
n a double-barreled offensive. 

Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher f s 
ask force planes made their third 
ippearance within eight days over 
-ne Japanese capital, smashing at 
irseuals, industrial plants, and mi- 
litary and naval installations in the 
Tokyo area. Possibly 1,200 carrier 
£ danes participated in tile strike. 

Hardly had the last Navy plane 
nade its final bombing run over 
Tokyo when the largest fleet of 
J-2j's ever assemoied fiilud the 
ikies and heightened the destruc- 
tion already milicted. 

A brief communique from Wash- 
ington revealed that over 2UU £1-29*8 
.aslied the Japanese cuptial. With 
an aveiage load of 10 tons carried 
y each li-iiy, this meant that at 
least i£,0uU tons ox' demolition and 
i ne bom os ieli qn the heart of Ja- 
( >an Sunday, without counting the 
loads dropped by ]\avy juaues. Not 
a single ^uper JKuuress was lost. 
Japanese ugnters leiuscd to detend 
their cap i Lai, and only light anti* 
aucraiL lire was encountered. 

Sunday's carrier attack on Tokyo 
followed the devastating two-day 
amash delivered February 1G-17 by 
Admiral Mitscher'a planes, in 
^'hich 32 Jap vessels were sunk and 
nearly 700 enemy planes were des- 
troyed or crippled. 

Oestroyer Rescues Two 
Fliers 25 ML off Tokyo 

*The details of a daring exploit 
by an American destroyer which 
sieamed within 25 miles of Tokyo 
Bay to rescue two navy pilots were 
revealed in a delayed dispatch 
from Admiral Mitscher'a task force 
flagship. 

The action occurred during the 
record carrier attack on Tokyo 
February If! and 17. A Navy dive- 
bomber was crippled by anti-air- 
craft fire over the Japanese capi- 
tal and settled in the water 25 
miles out. The destroyer raced in 
virtually under the nose of the Ja- 
panese fleet, and picked up the two 
men. Neither flyer got his feet 
wet.

The Task Ahead 



For sheer drawut, it would be 
hard to beat th historic Bc&ie at 
Mahtcanan Palace on Tuesday, 
when General MacArthur com- 
pleted the long road back by re- 
esta b linking f h e Commonwealth 
government in Manila, It was at 
Guicral M acA rVhur's svgges tion 
that ike Commonwealth govern- 
ment left Manila, three years ago. 
It itfis highly fitting that he per- 
sonally should have reestablished 
it in tim "Citadel of Democracy in 
the Far East." 

The wanton and useless destruc- 
tion of Manila will forever stand 
as a blot against the already 
stained shield of Japanese arms, 
The Japanese will pay the price 
for their brutality* But ike prob- 
lem now is one of rebuilding a des- 
troyed city, of reuniting a people 
in the mighty task of nation build- 
ing. 

That was the clarion cull sounded 
by President OsmeTia, when he said; 
"Not by dissemon and, bickeHngj 
not by resort to violence and law 
U'ssncss can we serve the national 
interest. It would be tragic indeed 
if . . . we should fall apart and be 
divided against ourselves . * ■ * To 
plunge ourselves HUa the abyss of 
disunion would be suicidal" 

The task of every Filipino, as 
1 'resident Osmeua point* out, i$ to 
put his shoulder to the wheel in 
the gigantic task of reconstruction. 
There is work, important work, for 
all

Gen. Romulo Broadcasts "Voice of 
Freedom" from Malacanan Palace 



[The following broadcast wm de- ™ 
livered be Brigadier General Car- f ^^ F ^ Q f the Orient 

bs P. Romulo, Resident Commit- a 
sfoner of the Philippines to UW 
United States, on the occasion of 
the reeetablishment of the Philip- 
pine Commonwealth in Mamla t 
Malacanan Palace, February 27, 
1945.) 

Today is for us a day of fulfil- 
ment. 



Today the Philippine Common- 
wealth/ founded in trust and lo- 
yalty, is reestablished on its un- 
shakable foundations, in this, the/ 
capital city of the Filipino people. 

This morning, President Sergio 
Osmena, standing in historic Ma- 
lacanan Palace, seat of Filipino 
sovereignty, received in the name 
of the Filipino people, from the 
hand which grasped the sword of 
liberation; the -hand of General 
Douglas MacArthur, the civil gov- 
ernment of the Philippines. 

After three long years of untold 
suffering, the Filipino people again 
know the heart-lifting feeling of 
freedom, After three long years 
of subjection, of stifling humilia- 
tion, they breathe again the air 
of liberty. The gratitude of a peo^ 
pie, unlike that of an individual, 
can never be adequately expressed. 
It is such a gratitude, beyond des- 
cription, that they feel' towards 
their deliverers, the American 
forces of liberation, 

We enter our capital, the city 
of Manila, and we find a pyre of 
ruins and ashes — evidence of Ja- 
panese savagery at a new low. 
Cornered and at bay, the smashed 
remnants of Yimashlta's defeated 



mound of wreckage for a 
tomb of helpless civilians. 

But not even this dastardly crime 
of a Japanese soldiery ^one ber- 
serk can daunt the people of the 
Philippines. After the fell of Ba- 
taan, this people, without food, its 
commerce ruined, its normal 
course of living disrupted, its 
deepest spiritual sanctions viola- 
ted — this people resisted the blan- 
dishments of Japanese duplicity, 
remained undaunted, As the 
weary months and years of sub- 
jecition dragged on, this people, 
without arms, without ammuni- 
tion, sometimes even without hope, 
still found the inner strength to 
resist Japanese brutality and ter- 
rorism, still remained undaunted, 

Today, the wanton destruction 
of Manila before their eyes shar- 
pens the determination which was 
inevitably born during those black 
years of subjection ;■ the determi- 
nation to carry the fight forward 
— across the northern seas— to the 
shores of the Japanese islands — to 
the heart of Tokyo itself. 

With this in view T know I echo 
the ardent desires of my people 
when I ask, in their name, for the 
privilege— nay ? for the light — of 
the Filipino soldier to share in the 
invasion of Japan. 

The American people have given 
their dearest possession — the be- 
loved youth of their land— as a 
sacrifice to liberate us from Jap- 
i'lH^c tyranny and oppression. We 
feel that gratitude for our libera- 
tion imposes on us, as men, the

Fillh rt Vai ^ £ uesda y M General 
Eisenhower's offensive to crush all 
t-erman resistance west of the 
Khine gathered momentum. 

General advances up to eight 
miles were made, in penetrations 
which carried American armies 33 
miles deep mto Germany and about 
300 miles from Berlin. At one 
point, U, S, forces entered Konig- 
shoven, 15 miles southwest of Dus- 
seldorf and drove into the outly- 
ing: defenses of Cologne, while 
heavy guns shelled the great ar- 
senal city. To the north, the U. 
S* Ninth Army advanced within 
five miles of the Ruhr Basin — 
jammed with factories vital to the 
German war m a chine - 

The Ninth Army break-through 
precipitated the "greatest rout of 
the German army since its retreat 
across France," wrote front-line 
observer Wes Gallagher of the As- 
sociated Press. For the first time 
on the Western Front, he said, 
thousands of German civilians were 
crowding the highways as Amer- 
ican tanks rumbled toward the 
Ruhr- 

"American troops racing for- 
ward in trucks to the right of 
Muenchen-Gladbaeh encountered 
virtually no opposition m moie 
than 10 miles. They overran the 
r-r-an 15th Army's replay 
pool, and captured both ottw 
and men in a state of great confu- 
sion. Hitler's highly 
home guard tried to 
dty bSt their performance was 

poor." _

ij^ 1 ^' Australia Morning 
Herald said: "The capital of an- 
other conquered country is libe- 
rated— the first in the Pacific to 
be set free. It is the culmination 
ot operations planned long ago by 
a master hand and executed in 
the face of the most formidable 
obstacles. The tide of Japanese 
conquest is ebbing fast." 

The Sydney Daily Telegraph 
added: "The achievement is one 
of the most remarkable exploits 
in military history. If Mac Arthur 
had had all the resources his rich 
nation, undistracted by a two- 
front war, could have provided for 
the campaign, the speed of his 
drive would still have been amaz- 
ing. As it is, history will be as- 
tonished that so much was accom- 



plished so quickly with so little," 

In Moscow, the official Soviet 
Navy publication Red Fleet called 
the entry of American forces Into 
Manila., a "great victory for the 
Allies." It added: "The Amer- 
ican fleet will gain a good system 
of bases, which will allow the 
Allies to increase their activity in 
the South China Sea, Powerful 
airdromes are situated in the re- 
gion of Manila, Naturally, all 
these advantages will sap Japan's 
military strength." 

"Even Tokyo's self -deluded lea- 
ders," the India Times declared, 
"Will find it difficult to concwU 
from themselves and from theii 
people the implications of this 
latest American victory." 

In the United States, the Chris- 
tian Science Monitor observed 
that the "capture of Manila will 
have more than a symbolic signi- 
ficance. It should give heart to 
all resistance groups in the Far 
East, for it demonstrates that tin 
Allies can and do carry out what 
they promise." 

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch 
said: "Now the dawn breaks. And, 
after a space of hard labor, Ma- 
nila and the Philippines will rise 
to new glory. Filipinos know the 
Commonwealth of the Philippines 
is born."

Shattered Fire 
Dept. Still on Duty 



Manila's firemen worked hard 
when the Japs fired the city. But 
the water stopped and the fire 
spread, and was soon everywhere 
out of hand. 

That was hardly the firemen's 
fault j they did their best. As 
they tried' to put down the flames, 
the Japanese shot at them. Tin 
holes in the hoses and the bodies 
of such fire engines as survived 
the Japanese attacks testify tft 
what the men of the fire depart- 
ment went through. 

At present such members of the 
fire department as are still around 
have their central station at the 
San Lazaro Station. There are 
152 men in the station. Other 
stations are located at Tond*j ? 
Tanduay, Sta. Mesa, Pasay, and 
San Juan, Caloocan. The station* 
south of the Pasig have either 
been destroyed or are in still pro- 
hibited areas* 

There are five engines ijj good 
condition, including one of the 
latest models?, gleaming and un- 
damaged and now lording it over 
the battered rest in the San La- 
zaro Station. There are four more

Destruction of the CorrcgiUor

ation in which a total of 
American troops overcame a Jap- 
anese strength of approximately 
BOOO troops, the communique 
seated* The island fortress, de- 
fended to the point of annihilation 
by a well-equipped, fanatical 
enemy, was reduced in twelve days 
by a combination of surprise stra- 
tegy, fighting technique and skill 
combined with perfectly coordi- 
nated support from naval and air 
forces* 

the communique reported 4215 
enemy bodies have already been 
counted, while many hundreds 
have been se .lu! in tunnela and 
caves where they were buried alive 
or blown to bits. Several hundred 
more were killed attempting to 
swim away from the island or 
escape by barge* Eighteen enemy 
prisoners were taken. 

Our losses were 131 killed, 531 
wounded and eight missing — a 
total of 675. 

American t-"oops in the XIV 
Corps sector continued to attack 
along the Kobiynshi Line against 
heavy enemy fire from rockets, 
mortars, machinep^ins and artil- 
lery. In the I Corps sector, heavy 
fighting was In p rogress northwest 
if Lumboy. Troops of the 32nd 
Division were driving steadily 
ihead an the VU1& Verde trail to- 
ward the Bnlete Pass Road at 
Santa Fc. The 33rd Division in 
the Rosario — Ajroo area continued 
>enet ration into the mountains. 

Our attack planes at low level 
tombed ard strafed enemy troops 
south of Vi^-an. Fighters struck 
nemy im-tallations at Baguio and 
*o the north* 

The department is trying to secure 
ipare parts to put the damaged 
:ntfines in working condition again. 
Soon after the entry of the 
American forces in the city, the 
Hre department was told by the 
United States Army to £0 into 
action. The salaries of the men, 
based on 1041 standards, are be- 
ing paid weekly by PGAU, 
^At least nine firemen were 
killed during the great fire. 
Among those killed was City Elec-

The ''Mickey Mouse" 
Currency 

The mgoestion has been made, 
apparently in all seriousness t that 
the (Jniud States or the Philippine 
government redeem the worthless 
money circulated by the Japanese 
in the Philippines, No suggestion 
could he more stupid, or more di~ 
sastrous in the false promise it 
holds out to the war-wracked) im- 
poverished people of the Philip- 
pines, 

Through the force of American 
arms the people of the Philippine^ 
have been liberated. They are 
again free to build for themselves, 
to keep what they produce by their 
ingenuity, resourcefulness and in- 
dustry. Their rightful government 
has been restored to them. Con- 
gress is considering relief and re- 
'labilitation measures, and public 
pronouncements of American lead- 
ers indicate that the United States 
will be generous i% its treatment 
1/ the Philippines,. 

But it is absurd to beliem that 
either the United Stales or the 
Philippine Commonwealth will re- 
deem the billions of pesos in 
"Mickey Mouse" money that the 
Japs foisted upon the Philippines. 
The people of the Philippines 
knew that Japanese money was 
worthless from the start. They 
were advised, by American radio 
broadcastSt to get rid of it as soon 
as they &>uld. Those who were not 
cooperating with the Jamnese 
didn't keep this money. They spent 
it as eoon as they could. So that 
anyone who has Japanese currency 
in any large quantities today is 
per se suspect of collaborating 
with the enemy. 

Tiio cost of defeating Fascism 
throughout the world is an incal- 
culable one. The United States . is 
spending money and using up its 
materia! resources^ to say nothing 
of sending the flower of its youth 
into battle, in the gigantic effort 
to destroy Me forces of tyranny 
and oppression. Not a single 
American has been untouched by 
ioar t every American has helped to 
pay the cost of the war* 

Hundreds of thousands of Fili- 
pinos have been impoverished by 
Japanese rule. Bui not one of 
them objects to the cost of freeing 
his country from the hated enemy* 
For today, after three years of 
darkness , the Filipino is again 
free to live his own life and to 
build for the f uture. 

The real Fil'pino wants no hand- 
out. He wants only to contribute 
all he can to defeating the enemy. 
He wants only a chmice to rebuild 
His national economy on a sound 
foundation. That chance is now 
being given him. To reward the 
collaborationists who have amassed 
great sums of Japanese money 
through the bny-and-sell racket 
would be fantastic^ 

Thiu "Mickey Mouse" money will 
not be redeemed. Anyone who 
thinks it will be, or who leads

Philippines. 

The Rehabilitation Commission, 
under the chairmanship of Senator 
Millard E. Tydings, met here Mon- 
day for the first time since United 
States forces of liberation landed 
in the Philippines. With all but 
tv/Q of eighteen members present, 
the commission moved quickly to 
approve formation of various sub- 
committees to handle questions of 
trade relations, war damages and 
commerce. 

Speaking for Filipino members 
of the commission, Jaime Hernan- 
dez, Philippines secretary of fi- 
nance and chairman of the Filipino 
group on the commission, said: 
"We believe that 20 years ia the 
minimum time that would enable 
us to make the needed rehabilita- 
tion, reconstruction and adustment 
of industries now dependent upon 
the American market. Included in 
this 20-year neriod is the time we 
lost as a result of the Japanese 
occupation and the time necessary 
to rebuild any of our industries, 
destroyed or damaged." 

Hernandez added that the pro- 
posal envisages continuing "the 
basic quotas established by the 
provisions of the independence act 
and as amended August 7, I939 t 
without the imposition and collec- 
tion of export taxes or the provi- 



under treaties with the 

St |^To accelerate the rehabilita- 
tion of the Philippines by giving

3— To adjust existing provisions 
of the law which impose 15 percent 
export taxes and 15 percent de* 
creasing quotas upon Philippine 
exports, t . , 

4— To reassure the Filipino 
people in the midst of their suf- 
fering and hardships that their 
pre-war economy will be stabilized 
and protected even after indepen- 
dence, . m 

Hernandez added; '"Unless some 
arrangement is arrived at for ad- 
justment or continuation in some 
form of the existing trade relation- 
ship between the United States and 



vestments. The Filipino P*^

Manila Folic* Farce 
Cooperates With Army 

When the Americans entered 
Manila, the police force stationed 
oil the north side of the Pasig 
quickly presented itself to the 
Provost Marshal of the United 
States Army, The men were in- 
structed to cooperate in the estab- 
lishment of peace and order while 
the city burned. 

At present there are 290 of- 
ficers and men composing the 
North District, with headquarters 
at Central Hotel, corner of Az- 
carraga and Kizal Avenue, The 
men received remuneration from 
the PCAU based on their pre-war 
salaries. This group is made up 
of policemen already in service 
when the war broke out in 1941. 
Those inducted during the puppet 
regime have been suspended.

rni kV T J*P da y before the massed 
mi^nt of American First and Ninth 
^rmy mobile columns, in what 
iront-lme dispatches described as 
a "virtual rout." 

General Eisenhower damped a 
news-blackout on the swift move- 
ment of the Ninth Army as many 
German units were isolated far to 
the rear in fluid and confused 
fighting. Unofficial estimates 
placed at least 25,000 German 
prisoners in American hands in 
the current six-day offensive. 

The First Army, driving into 



the centeT of the German line, 
forced three bridgeheads across the 
last major water barrer before the 
Rhine, capturing one bridge in- 
tact One crossing was made only 
8hh miles southwest of Cologne, 
while to the north, Canadian First 
Army troops moved within CO miles 
of a junction with Ninth Army 
spearheads. 

The air offensive went into its 
16th straight day Wednesday as 
two great fleets of XL S. and Bri- 
tish heavies joined in strong at- 
tacks on rail and industrial targets 
in northwestern Germany.

of peace and order regulations are 
being handled by the Manila Po-

into Police Court and disposed of 
promptly; the police lack the ne- 
cesaery facilities for handling de- 
tention prisoners.

Osmena ThanksFDR 
On Filipinos' Behalf 

Immediately after establishing 
his office in Malacanan, President 
Sergio Osmeiia sent the following 
cablegram to President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt: 

"Upon the reatablishment today 
of the government of the Common, 
wealth of the Philippines in the 
city of Manila t permit me to ex- 
press to you and to the people of 
ih$ United States the most pro- 
found gratitude of the Filipino 
people for our liberation. 

"To you, Mr. President, who, in 
our grim days in Corregidor and 
Bataan solemnly pledged to us in 
the name of the American people 
the men and resources of the Uni- 
ted States to free us from enslave- 
ment, this day must be a day of 
happiness over a pledge fulfilled. 
So is it also a zay of happiness for 
□s in spite of the sufferings and 
miseries inflicted on us by a bru- 
tal enemy. 

"Incensed by Filipino loyalty to 
the United States and the cause of 
democracy, he razed Manila and 
many of our cities and towns to 
the ground and murdered hundreds 
of thousands of our people. But 
the spiritual strength of the Fili- 
pino people remains unshaken. We 
shall continue the struggle with 
every ounce of our strength until 
final victory is achieved. Over the 
ashes of Manila, we shall build a 
new city and over the ruins of 
war there shall arise a stronger 
Filipino nation ready to contribute 
its all in close cooperation with 
the United States to the freedom 
and security, the peace and happi- 
ness of mankind." 



Seize Puerta 
Princesa and 
Two Airfields 

American troops landed Wed- 
nesday on Palawan, fifth largest 
island in the Philippines, General 
MacArthur's comunlque said Fri- 
day. The American 31st division, 
veterans of Hollandia, Wakde and 
Biak, pushed swiftly inland from 
the beachhead to capture Puerta 
Princesa, capital and principal 
city of the island, and two nearby 
airfields. 

The enemy garrison, caught 
flat-footed, fled to the hills. Our 
losses were very light, 

MacArthur's comunique says' 

"Engrossed in operations else- 
where, the enemy again failed to 
diagnose our plans and properly 
prepare his defense/ 1

No Place For 
Collaborators 

in the present reorganization of 

tko Commonwealth Government 
an d local governmental agencies, 
those who voluntarily worked for 
the Japanese or who engaged ex- 
tensively in the u Buy and SelV 
racket should have no share. 

Those who fought for freedom 
and relisted the enemy during the 
last three and a IMf years ehould 
now be given the opportunity to 
shape the order of things for which 
they sacrificed and rUksd their 
lives* 

Extreme care should consequent- 
ly be exercised in the selection of 
public officials, Collaborators now 
in the l J CAU or police force should 
not be allowed to continue work- 
ing until they have been officially 
cleared, if justice and the senti- 
ments of the people are to be con- 
sidered. 

The blood shed by the loyal 

ehould not be made in vain by 
adopting a soft and indifferent at- 
titilde towards thase who aided the 
cause of the enemy* 

Only those are fit to serve the 
Commonwealth who were not 
afraid to die for the Common- 
wealth* 



3,039 Enrolled In 
7 Reopened Schools 

Seven elementary schools have 
already been opened in Manila and 
a total of 3 t 039 pupils have en- 
roll ed f according to Secretary 
Maximo Kalaw of the department 
of public instruction and informa- 
tion. 

Secretary Kalaw received his 

appointment as secretary of public 
instruction and information from 
President Sergio Osmena on Tues- 
day, when the Commonwealth gov- 
ernment was reestablished in Ma- 
nila, 

Enrollment in the high schools 
in Manila is now under way, and 
more elementary schools in other 
districts of the city will be opened 
as soon as buildings for the pur- 
pose are available, Kalaw said. 

There are 75 .sections in the 
seven elementary schools already 
opened in Manila, according to 
the secretary. The Lakandula 
elementary school tops the last in 
enrollment with 26 sections and 
1,210 pupils. The other schools 
are the Alejandro Albert Elemen- 
tary, P. Guevarra, G* del Pilar, 
Bonifacio, Burgos and Tondo Ele

several former prisoner* at -tort 
Santiago. 

The military police came 10 a 
man's bouse to get him early in 
the morning, while he was certain 
to be sleeping and unprepared for 
the visitation* The Japanese came 
in cars, later in the occupation m 
trucks. They posted a man at 
every exit. Then they burst into 
the house, ordered everybody out 
of bed, and took their mart* 

The Japanese took him to the 
fort. Inside the main gate he was 
taken into the headquarters of the 
military police, where he was care- 
fully searched. Everything he had, 
Handkerchiefs, papers, pocketbook, 
money, keys, etc, was taken away 
for examination and deposit* If 
che man was dismissed, they were 
returned to him, 

There were four cells near the 
desk where the man taken in was 
searched. Into one of them the 
prisoner was thrown. If there 
were several, each went into a ; 
separate cell, so they could not 
compare notes and match stories. 

Later the prisoner was taken 
into another part of the fort where 
there was a row of cells, not too 
narrow, not too wide, and into one 
he went and did not come out 
again except when he was removed 
for questioning and what went 
with it; picked and privileged to 
take the pail out; sentenced, or 
released. Those in the- cell were 
packed close. At night when a man 
lay down to sleep he could not 
move till morning. During the day 
each sat on his haunches the Ja- 
panese way. He must not talk.

Palawan Island 

PUERTO PRINCESA, Pala- 
wan — Infantrymen of the 
American 41st division probing 
the bombw recked Palawan cons- 
tabulary barracks here have 
unearthed additional evidence 
of the massacre of 150 Amer 
ican prisoners of war last De 
cember by the Japanese, 

Human bones and bits of 
charred clothing covered by a 
layer of dirt and rubble were 
found in one of the air-raid 
shelters near the barracks, mute 
testimony of the wholesale 
slaughter already revealed by 
affidavits of at least five pri 
sonera who escaped death. 

One of the escaped prisoners, 
describing the atrocity, said: 

"In December, the Japs got 
word there was a big convoy 
at sea. They thought the con 
voy going to Mindoro was 
headed this way and became 
crazy with fear. They herded 
us into a string of underground 
shelters, threw gasoline in on us 
and ignited it When we tried 
to get out they mowed us down 
with machineguns. ,,

The record of each police officer

occupation is now being investi- 
gated, and those whose activities 
have been questionable will be re- 
placed by newly trained men. 

Announcement of qualifications 
required of police candidates, and 
of locations of recruiting offices, 
will be made later, CoL James

soldiers with machineguns kept the

Driving along the road around 
Malinta Hill, the General revisited 
the devastated area where at one 
time stood his house and those of 
president Quezon and High Com- 
missioner Francis B. Sayre. Stalk-

enemy forces on Bicol peninsula

General MacArthur's communi-

'Their occupation threatens en-

The American Sixth division

The 38th division seized Iba and

Commodity Prices Still Up 



Thm Return to Corregidor 

Few events of this or any other 
war can rival the historical drama 
enacted on Corregidor last week 
when General Mac Arthur and 
members of his staff returned to 
The Rock after a three-year cam- 
paign that carried them to Aus- 
tralia and bach 

The story of Corregidor can be 
told in two chapters. The first 
chapter concerns those "grim, 
gaunt and ghostly men" who hela 
superior enemy forces at bay for 
five interminable months in the 
spring of 1942, 

The second chapter was written 
in February, 1945, when superbly- 
equipped paratroopers dropped out 
of the skrfs over Corregidor, des- 
troyed a gamson more than twice 
their number and &e<zcd the fort 
reus in a six-day blitzkrieg. 

The original defenders of Cor- 
regidor and the eventual liberators 
of the island tiad tittle in common 
but the fierce determination of 
free men to destroy tyranny every- 
where. The one great factor that 
bound them together, that assured 
them a place in the history books, 
was the general ivho led them both 
For General MacArthur the re- 
turn to Corregidor has been a cru- 
sade, one from which he never for 
a second turnnd his thoughts or 
his efforts during the long years 
that he fought his way back. And 
last week when he again stood on 
the storied island and watched the 
Stars and Stripes hoisted to the 
top of the flagpole on Topside, he 
?nust have sensed the inaudible ac- 
claim of the entire world, "Well 
done, soldier*" 

Allied European 
Drive Expands 

PARIS — American Ninth 
Army units, spearheading the ex- 
panding Allied offensive in the 
West, sped forward 15 miles Fri- 
day to the Rhine River, and cap- 
tured Neuss, a Dusseldorf suburb. 

The American surge overran the 
western edge of the Ruhr Valley 
as German Lines buckled ail along- 
the upper end of the Western 
Front. North of Neuss, other 
Ninth Army units entered the 
Ruhr steel center of Krefeld. TJ. 
S. artillery pumped tons of shells 
across the Rhine after Neuss and 
other towns on the west bank sur- 
rendered practically without a 
fifxht* Among the major German 
cities captured during the past 24 
hours were Muenchen-Gladbach, 
and the Dutch strongpoint of 
Venlo. 



Out! month after the liberation 
of Manila, prices of prime commo- 
dities in the city have not shown 
any appreciable drop, except in the 
case of rice which is being sold 
at around FL5Q a ganta. The 
government price is 32 centavos a 
ganta. It is expected that as 
transportation facilities improve, 
the price of rice will come down to 
normal level. 

In the case of fish, the price 
charged in the markets is still be- 
yond the average man's pocket, a 
survey over the weekend revealed. 
Bangus, or milk fish, which the 
government has fixed at 30 centa- 
vos a kilo, sells anywhere from 
1*2.00 to P3.0G at the Divisoria and 
Pritil' markets. The supply of 
meat is very limited* Carabac 
meat is available now and then, 
and sells for P4.00 a kilo. The 
government price for. meat is 60 
centavos* 

Largely due to the lack of meat

the markets is prohibitive* The 
government has fixed the price of i 



chicken lit from 25 centavoa to 
P1.25, but in all the markets in 
the city, including the San Lazaro 
market on Calle Blumentritt, the 
price of a large hen ranges from 
PI 0*00 to f»i2*00. 

Ejrgs and fruits are also in tne 
high price brackets. Eggs sell at 
70 centavos each as against 3 cen- 
tavos fixed by the government

to 25 centavos each, 

Chico costs 20 centavos, while 
papaya, selling during pre-wa*

1*2.50. 

American cigarets cost any- 
where between PI, 50 to P2.0O e 
package, local ciga rets from 5C 
centavos to PI, 00 a package. 

One notable thing is that bus!

are not as brisk as might be ex

don't have much money, and man;, 
simply refuse to pay* the big!

tion, some observers declare, wil 
go a long way toward bringing 
prices down to normal*

Enemy Suffers 
Great Losses 

In Fighting 

Filipino guerrillas, supported by

Guerrillas under command of 
Colonel R. W. Volckman, complete- 
ly cleared the enemy from the 
province of IJoeos Norte in north- 
west Luzon, MacArthur's commu- 
nique said; 

9m "In this irregular type of fight- 
injr which the enemy has been un- 
able to fathom, he sustained extra- 
ordinarily heavy losses running 
into the thousands. Our own were 
minor," 

The American 25th Division 
captured Digdig, ten mffiea touth

Public Health Is 
Everybody's Concern 



Unless a Minimum standard of 
sanitation w maintained in Mamla, 
an epidemic of major scale should 
by ail the rules btf just around the 
corner. It is enough for any com- 
petent health officer to walk in the 
ma.71 and bystreets of the city to 
realize th& imminence of the 
threat. 

Inadequate water supply, which 
is nobody s fault but the Japanese; 
the sale of food on the sidewalk 
amid a constant shower of dust, 
which is a perfect germ carrier; 
flies breeding and multiplying 
such appropriate 9 conditions as the 
decaying corpses in the south side, 
the careless habit of throwing 
waste anywhere and everywhere, 
the improper disposal of garbage, 
all of which are our citizens' 
fault, make the health threat no 
idle one. 

The people must cooperate with 
the authorities in maintaining sa- 
nitation in the city- Congestion, 
created by the destruction of most 
of the city t makes the problem 
more difficult, but unless all make 
an extra effort to keep the city 
clean, all may soon be paying the 
penalty for the neglect, 



Tondo People Solve 
Housing Problem 



Undaunted by the Japanese des- 
truction of their homes, people m 
the Tondo district have started 
building improvised dwellings 
from salvaged lumber and bamboo, 
and galvanized iron roofing. Dur- 
ing the past week scores of such 
homes have sprung up along San- 
de, Juan Luna and Hcrbosa 
streets. More such houses are un- 
der construction. 

Bartolomc Gatmaitan, city coun- 
cilman for the Tondo district, es- 
timated yesterday that about 
2,000 families lost their homes 
when four blocks of the most thick- 
ly populated areas oi Tondo from 
Juan Luna to the Manila North 
Harbor when up in flames. Re- 
fugees numbering 7,000 found tem- 
porary homes in the old Torres 
high school building in Gagalan- 
gin and at the Magat Salamat 
elementary school on Velasquez 
street* 

Assisted by PCAU No. 4 which 
provided them with food, hardy 
Tondenos who were victims in the 
big fire of 1037 and in the greater 
one of May, 1941, refused to be 
cowed by another such disaster. 
Rolling up their sleeves, Tondo 
men from the shores of Bankusay 
nnd Velasquez have joined the 
forces of PCAU laborers and U.S. 
Army workers on military cons- 
truction projects,

"Jap Warlords Know What Is 
In Store For Homeland"- FDR 



WASHINGTON — President 
Roosevelt, in a report to Congress 
and the nation on the results of his 
conferences with Prime Minister 
Churchill and Marshal Stalin, dec- 
lared last week that "the Japanese 
war lords know what is in store for 
the homeland now that General 
MacArthur has completed his mag- 
nificent march back to Manila and 
Admiral Nimitz is establishing his 
air bases ri^ht in the back yard of 
Japan -itself in Iwo Jima." 

■ This reference to the Battle of thy 
Pacific highlighted a long address 
devoted for the most part to the 
European war, the political pro- 
blems of Europe, and the outline 
of a blueprint for world peace. 
Discussing the decisions reached at 
Malta in a separate conference 
with Churchill on plans to increase 
the offensive against Japan, Mr. 
Roosevelt added: 

J- The Japanese war lords know 
that they are not being overlooked. 
They have felt the force of our 
B-29's and our carrier planes; 
they have felt the naval might of 
the United States, and do npt ap- 
pear very anxious to come out and 
try it again. 



"it is still a tough, long road to 
Tokyo. The defeat of Germany 
will not mean the end of the war 
against Japan. But the uncondi- 
tional surrender of Japan is as 
essential as the defeat of Germany 
— if our plans for world peace are 
to succeed. For Japanese mili- 
tarism must be wiped out as tho- 
roughly as German militarism." 

Then, launching into an outline 
of the Crimean conference with 
both Marshal Stalin and Chur- 
chill, the president stated his "firm 
belief that we have made a good 
start on the road to a world of 
peace." Pie outlined the two main 
purposes of the Crimean confer- 
ence. The first was to bring de- 
feat to Germany "with the greatest 
possible speed and with the small- 
est loss" of Allied manpower. 

"Tremendous strides also were 
made toward the second goal — 
"That purposes" he said, "is now 
being carried out in great force." 
"to build the foundation for an in- 
ternational accord which would 
bring order and security after the 
chaos of war, and which would 
give some assurance of lasting 
peace among the nations of the 
world." 



Civilian Defense Unit 
To Aid Police in Manila 



On the initiative of Alfred o Eu- 
genio, former national' air-raid 
warden, a Civilian Defense Divi- 
sion has been created under 
the Public Safety Unit of PCAU 
20* 

The purpose of the unit is pri- 
marily to supervise the activities 
of volunteer guards, and to help 
detect the presence* of saboteurs, 
Japanese shiperi, and looters with- 
in the districts covered by PCAU 
20. The Civilian Defense Division 
nas been furnished with the loca- 



tions of the various military posts 
to which they will submit their 
reports, and from which they may 
ask for armed assistance in ca?c 
of necessity. This newly created 
organization will also undertake 
to act as liaison between the Amer- 
ican military forces and the peo- 
ple, according to Eugenio. 

The Civilian Defense Division 
will work in close cooperation with 
trie Manila police and the Amer- 
ican military police, T n the ab- 
sence of -adequate facilities for 
combating fires, the Civilian De- 
fense Division will also concern \u 
self with the detection of arson 
cases and fires which they will re- 
port to the nearest military posts. 



Small Hospital 
Here Handling 
Great Load 

Public Hospital' PCAU No 4, ,« 
the corner of Tecson aud 1. &dr\h 
shavv streets in Tondo, is now mm- 
tiering to the medical needs of 
the people not only of Ion do, San 
Nicolas and Binondo, for whom the 
makeshift hospital was primarily 
set up, but also to all eases coming 
in from as far away as Malatc 
across the Fasig, and MalaDon 
and Navotas, Rizal. 

The hospital crew from a hum- 
ble first-aid station under Drs. 
Vicente Caniza and Paulino Al~ 
bano and Atty. Jose Racela. Me- 
dicines and primary remedies were 
donated by public-spirited indivi- 
duals shortly before the coming 
of the Americans. For the most 
part, civilians suffering from 
wounds caused by Japanese shrap- 
nel and bullets were taken care of. 

When the liberation forces ar- 
jived, Capt. Conrado Topacio, who 
is in charge of PCAtJ 4, looked 
over the place and decided it could 
serve as an adjunct to the Amer- 
ican Army medical service scar- 
ing civilian needs. As such, the 
hospital is under the immediate 
supervision of the U. & military 
medical authorities, and is being 
provided with necessary supplies 
by the U. S. Army. With practi^ 
cally all of the pre-war hospital 
facilities in Manila crippled be- 
cause of necessary military opera- 
tions, this small hospital is carry- 
ing a great load.

U.S. First Army Troops 
Drive Half Mile into City 



PARIS — The Battle of the Rhine approached a climax Monday 
as American First Army tanks and mobile infantry smashed into the 
great fortress city of Cologne, and drove nearly a mile toward the 
heart of the city. 

The advance into Cologne — Germany's fifth largest city — high- 
lighted the offensive on the Western Front which placed Allied troops 
in control of 100 miles of the Rhine west bank and resulted in the 

death, capture, or wounding of

Jap Army Paper 
Raps Tokyo Gov't 

MOSCOW — A sharply-worded 

criticism of Japan's mismanage- 
ment of the war effort was voiced 
this week by the Japanese Army 
newspaper Tairiku Shimpo pub- 
lished in Shanghai, according to 
an article in the official Russian 
newspaper Pravda. Shimpo blamed 
Tokyo war leaders for failure to 
cope "with a situation which al- 
lowed the U. S. invasion of Iwo 
Jima only four months after Gen- 
eral MacArthur launched his cam- 
paign in the Philippines." 

"All measures heretofore taken," 
the Japanese Army organ declared, 
"have ended in empty statements 
and have not been realized

Santo Tomas Has One oj 
Manila's Longest Queues 

One of the longest queues in 
Manila is at the Santo Tomas 
scales . 

As liberated internees and pri- 
soners of war await transporta- 
tion to the United States, they are 
eager to restore as much weight 
possible now that good food is 
plentiful. 

There is only one scale, and 
every day they wait in line — per- 
sons who lost as much as 100 
pounds under Japanese captivity 
— to see how many ounces they 
have put on daily. All have gained 
appreciably in the last couple of 
weeks. 



Vital War Events In 
China Predicted Soon 



WASHINGTON — Acting Sec- 
retary of State Joseph Grew on 
Saturday predicted military dev- 
elopments of "decisive importance" 
in China this year. He underscored 
the importance of unity between 
the Chinese national government 
and Chinese Communists in their 
joint fight against Japan. 

In this connection, General AI 
bert C. Wedemeyer, U. S. Army 
commander in China, arrived m 
Washington Sunday along witn

Qualifications of x 
A Jap Commander 

Radio Tokyo last week broad- 
cast the following profile of Lt. 
Gen. Tadamichi Kuribayashi, 
commander-in-chief of Japanese 
forces on Iwo Jima: 

He knows Iwo so well "that 
even should he be asked where 
a certain hole made by a rat is 
to be found, he would answer 
quickly without any hesitation." 

"His partly protruding belly 
is packed full of strong fighting 
spirit." 



New Telephone 
System Planned 

While plans for the restoration 
of facilities for the normal opera- 
tion of a telephone communication 
system in Manila are being worked 
out, telephone service is being 
handled by the Signal Corps of the 
United States Army. 

At present the corps is making 
a survey of the extent of the dam- 
age to the equipment of the Phil- 
ippine Long Distance Telephone 
Company, and the available faci- 
lities at its disposal. 

According to Gabriel Daza, an 
official of the company, three of 
the central exchanges were des- 
troyed by the Japanese. These 
were located at Santa Cruz, Ma- 
late and Pasay. Most of the street 
cables were likewise destroyed. 

The company has established 
temporary offices on the second 
floor of the Filipinas hotel at the 
corner of Rizal Avenue and Az- 
carraga, to which its former em- 
ployees are requested to report.

Other Enemy 
Forces Divided, 
Bottled Up 



Sixty percent of Yamashita's ori- 
ginal forces on Luzon have been 
wiped out, General MacArthur 
estimated Tuesday. The equivalent 
of six enemy divisions of the ori- 
ginal ten, plus many supply and 
garrison troops, have been des- 
troyed together with the main 
supply depots holding great quan- 
tities , of ordnance, munitions, 
trucks, food and clothing. 

The remaining enemy forces are 
divided and bottled up. Their po- 
sition is critical, the communique 
said. Their supply situation is 
difficult, control and communica- 
tion presenting impossible obsta- 
cles. 

The Tuesday communique sum- 
marized American positions on Lu- 
zon as follows: 

XI Corps sector: The 38th and 
43rd divisions are clearing the 
Zambales mountains by an encir- 
cling movement north and west. 

XIV Corps sector: American 
troops are gradually enveloping 
the strongly defended Wawa-An- 
tipolo line. 

I Corps sector: The 25th divi- 
sion, driving north, cleared the 
Balete Pass road from Digdig to 
Puncan. The 32nd division is 
pushing east along the Villa Verde 
trail and the Ambayabang river. 

An additional 1,068 Japanese 
have been killed in the Leyte area 
during the past week.

At one point, the Marines were 
less than 300 yards from the

More Jap Brutality 

The nations fighting Japan by 
now need no further proof of Japa. 
nem besiiatitg, nor of the fact that 
that bcxtial.ty in exhibited against 
ait who have the misfortum to fall 
into tneir hands, without regard 
for race, religion or other differ- 
ence** 

The latest example is Palawan. 
General Mae Arthur' 8 forces upon 
landing there Last week found con- 
clusive pruof that enemy troops 
had burned and shot 350 American 
military prisoners. One of the 
few toho escaped described how the 
Jap gurrisyn became panic-strick- 
en what the ]\1 indoro*bound V* S. 
convey was Sighted, The soldiers 
thought the force was headed for 
Palawan, and butchered the pri- 
soners, 

Fdipinos reading that account 
were painfully reminded of what 
happened to thoir own relatives or 
friends recently in Manila or its 
environs,. Chinese hearing of it 
would * remember Nanking or 
Shanghai or any one of a hundred 
others of the destroyed cities oj 
China. It would call up similar 
bitter ntemor.es in the minds of 
Koreans, Manehurians, Burmese 
or Indonesians, 

The Japanese leaders had 
thought to ease their path of con* 
quest through Asia by cultivating 
old prejudices, appealing to in- 
tolerance t exploiting the long- 
standing frictions between East 
and West. By setting race against 
race, they planned to build a world 
empire subject to Tokyo, 

But those same leaders are the 
ones who t time and again f loosed 
their savage soldiery on helpless 
civilians or prisoners of war. It 
uiuLd their race propagarida, and 
more; it united all the nations and 
peoples who • are at ivar with the 
Japamse t in a democracy of com- 
mon intent. Japanese brutality 
has forged a steel ring of out- 
raged humanity .around Nippon, 
which will b nd forever her power 
again to bring such suffering 
upon the world. 




Increasing* pressure from U 
<dr attacks and the staggei 
blow to Japanese prestige resul 
from General MacArthur's lib 
tion of Manila have tripped \ 
vo's government leaders, forca 
walk a tight-rope through the ;

Town of Tmus Missed 
Destruction By Day 

The town of Imus, Cavite, 
escaped massacre and destruction 
by the Japanese by a single day. 

First came the destruction of Ma- 
nila. "Prom Imus," one resident 
said, "Manila at night seemed one 
huge carnival, it was so lighted 
up." On February 4 the people of 
the town were on their way to 
mass when troops from the U. S. 
airborne force that took Tagaytay 
roared into the city in jeeps and 
tanks and with the aid of the guet-

The historic walled city of In- 
fcramuros which Legaspi built in 
1570 is virtually destroyed, In the 
two-mile circular enclosure, there 
is little but ruins and debris and 
shell holes. All these- are mute wit- 
ness to the savagery of a foe who 
cared nothing for historic seats ol 
learning ana culture, much less for 
churches and hospitals and civilian 
.ion -combatants , 

Pt Santiago is a mass of ruins 
and wreckage. The forbidding 
.valla jutting out of the Fasig river 
nave crumbled, while its age-old 
uuildings, with their underground 
eellfc and dungeons, are rubble, 
Shot and shell and flume put an 
end to the horror that was Ft* 
Santiago. 

Most of the churches of Intra- 
muros are crumbing piles of stone 
and granite. The Cathedral, one 
jf the oldest and most beautiful 
churches in the Philippines, is a 
sad sight, having received a severe 
beating from both friend and foe. 
But so are other churches, like 
St. Ignatius on Calle Arzobispo, 
St. Agustin on Calle Real, San 
Francisco on Calle Solana, Reco- 
ietos on Calle MagaUanes and 
Lourdes on Calle Gral. Luna, The 
Jap soldiers used them and des- 
troyed them. 

The modernized Letran college 
from its fourth story once com- 
manded a good view of Manila 
bay and the city's business dis- 
trict. It failed to withstand the 
onslaught, as it did back in De- 
cember, 1941, when the Japs 
bombed Manila and destroyed the 
rich Sto, Domingo church in the 



process. Now Letran stands tall 
and gaunt, and punctured by 
shrapnel, . 

Sta, Catalina college shared the 
fate of Letran, So did Sta. Rosa 
college and Sta. Isabel. The Sto. 
Tomas University building on Calle 
Aduana, another great historic 
landmark in lntramuros ? is now 
a pile of blackened stone. Other 
razed school buildings are the Na- 
tional university, Manila univer- 
sity, Philippine Law school and 
the Araulio high school on Calle 
Victoria, the last a government 
institution. 1 

The AyuntamientOj where the 
first Philippine Assembly con- 
vened in 11W7, is destroyed. So 
also the building housing the de- 
partment of justice, and those oc- 
cupied by the Supreme Court, the 
Court of Appeals and the courts 
of first instance of Manila. 

The San Juan de Dios hospital 
was not spared. When the fight- 
ing began, many of its patients 
were killed by shrapnel* others 
who tried to crawl to safety were 
shot by Japanese snipers. 

American soldiers who started 
evacuating civilians early Friday 
morning, February 23, saved 
about 3,000 civilians from the in- 
ferno which was Intramuros for 
long two weeks. 



Indicating other cleavages wi 
Japan's governmental circles, ' 
yo Radio admitted that the H 
of Peers was "seeking a detj 
and clear report on present 
ditions in view of the serious 
of the war situation/'

Mac Arthur's \ Allies Shatter 100 Miles 
Planes Active \Of Nazis' Rhine Defenses 
Off Formosa 




Six Japanese vessels were sunk 
and three others, including a des- 
troyer escort, were badly damaged 
in a series of air strikes off For- 
mosa and in the South China Sea, 
General MacArthur's Wednesday 
communique said. Combat activi y 
on Luzon was limited. Twenty 
enemy "Q" boats were captured 
south of Ternate by patrols of the 
11th Airborne division. 

"Patrol planes off Formosa sank 
a 6000 ton Japanese freighter- 
transport and left another, plus a 
destroyer escort, in flames, the 
communique said. 

Reconnaisance bombers in day- 
light sank a small freighter and 
damaged another southeast ol 
Shanghai. Two small vessels and 
two schooners were sunk or dam- 
aged east of Hongkong while other 
planes sank harbor craft in Cam- 
ranh Bay, French Indo-Chma. 

Air patrols swept Cagayan 
Valley on Luzon, wrecking five 
enemy planes. Other bombers and 
fighters pounded Japanese instal- 
lations and airfields on Panay, 
Cebu and Mindanao. 

PT boats on patrol off the £am- 
bales coast sank an enemy coastal 
craft tilled with escaping troops. 

Britain's Pacific 
Fleet Now keady 

MELBOURNE — Aumiral Sir 
Bruce Fraser, British Pacific

this week that his warships are 
"ready and waiting for action m 
the Pacific." , . , 

Naval units under his command 
have been converted for long-range 
Pacific operations, he revealed. 
"A large part — fifty percent — 
consist of aircraft carriers, and 
the role they can play against Ja- 
pan should be a big one." 



PARIS — Cologne, Germany's 
fifth largest city, fell Tuesday 
night to U. S. First Army troops 
as German lines crumbled along a 
100-mile stretch of the Rhine Ri- 
ver in the West. 

First Army tanks and infantry 
fought past Cologne's famous ca- 
thedral which they had been or- 
dered to spare, crushing resistance 
of doomed enemy rearguards. One- 
third to one-half the city was in 
American hands before noon, and 
three divisions closed in with in- 
creasing speed from the northwest, 
the west, and the southwest. 
Much of the city was burning, and 
the majority of civilians appeared 



to have fled. 

The capture of Cologne signalled 
the disintegration of German mili- 
tary power west of the Rhine. 
Nearly 100 miles of the west bank 
northward was in Allied hands or 
swept by artillery. Remnants of 
three German field armies were 
steadily being wiped out. 

South of Cologne, U. S. Third 
Army tanks spurted 25 miles in 30 
hours to move within 20 miles of 
the Rhine in the Coblenz area. 
Above Cologne, U. S. Ninth Army 
forces wiped out all but one small 
pocket south of Duesseldorf and 
captured over 1,300 prisoners, in- 
cluding one general. 



Tokyo Worried 

There is mounting concern in 
Tokyo over the fate of Iwo Jima, 
and the possibility of new moves

Will they attack directly on the

Romulo Family 
Rescued by U.S. 
6th Army Trcops 

After eluding the Japanese for 
39 months, Mrs. Carlos Romulo 
and children were rescued recently 
by U. S. 6th Army men under the 
command of Brig. Gen. Courtney 
Whitney, and Capt. George Meeler 
of San Bernardino, California. 

Carlos Romulo, Jr., eldest son 
of the resident commissioner, Gen. 
I Carlos P. Romulo, directed the 
execution of Gen. Whitney's plans. 
As an officer of Marking's guer- 
rillas, he came from the hills 
through the Japanese lines, and 
took his mother and two brothers 
to the summit of an undisclosed 
mountain where a secret airfield 
had been hastily constructed. 

At the appointed hour, four 
cub planes of the 6th army landed 
within sight of the Japanese, and 
took off with Mrs. Carlos Romulo, 
her two sons Dick and Bobby, and 
a brother of Mrs. Romulo — one 
passenger to each plane. 

Young Romulo, after seeing his 
mother off, re-crossed the Japanese 
lines to reach his brother Grego 
rig, who was slightly ill. Toge 
ther they escaped to Manila, on 
foot, horseback, banca and then 
by truck. , _ 

First family reunion of the Ko- 
mulos was held in Manila Mon- 
day night, when each member ot 
the family recounted their various 
experiences during the last three 
and a half years. 

Personnel of each PCAU unit in 
Manila is composed of 10 officers 
and 39 enlisted men. There are 
nine sections in each unit, under 
a commanding officer. They in- 
clude: Administration, Publu:

British Sever Ail 
Rangoon-Mandalay 
Communications 

KANDY, CEYLON — British 
tanks and air-borne infantry, in 
a spectacular 85-mile advance 
across the Irrawaddy river valley, 
slashed all main Japanese land, air 
and water links between Mandalay 
and Rangoon, seriously threaten- 
ing the entire Japanese position 
in Burma, Allied headquarters 
revealed Tuesday. 

The British seized eight airfields 
intact, killed more than 1,600 Jap- 
anese troops and captured 40 guns. 

Among the strongpoints to fall 
was the key communications center 
of Meiktila, 70 miles south of 
Mandalay, on February 27, as the 
result of coordinated tank and air- 
borne operations. 

British tanks first captured 
two nearby air strips, enabling, 
air-borne infantry to land. The 
two forces then joined to seize six 
other airdromes and key positions 
surrounding Meiktila* 



GUAM — Battle lines on Iwo 
Jima were unchanged Tuesday. 
But U. S. Marine units broke up 
repeated Japanese attempts to in- 
filtrate American lines and ca- 
sualties on both side increased. 
Mopping up on Mount Suribachi 
in the south revealed many more 
Japanese casualties including over 
150 enemy dead found in a single 
cave. 



Departmental 
Changes Made 
By President 

Swearing in of newly appointed 
members of the Osmeiia cabinet 
will take place this morning 
at 10 o'clock at MaVaoanan. Names 
of the appointees will be announced 
at that time. 

First step toward the reorgani- 
zation of the Commonwealth gov- 
ernment was taken yesterday by 
President Sergio Osmeiia, with 
the signing of executive order No. 
27. The order restores the exe- 
cutive departments as they existed 
before the Japanese invasion, with 
slight modifications adapted to 
present exigencies. The order was 
dated February 27. 

Nine departments were created 
by executive order No. 27: Inte- 
rior; Finance; Justice; Agricul- 
j ture and Commerce; Public Works 
and Communications; Instruction 
and Information; National De- 
fense, Health and Public Welfare; 
and Labor. 

All these nine departments will 
be under the direct control of the 
respective department secretaries, 
exercising their functions subject 
to the general supervision and 
control of the president. 

The department of information 
and public relations, created under 
Laurel's order No. 8-W, series of 
1943, was abolished by executive 
order No. 27. Officials and em- 
ployees of this department, if- the 
needs of the service require and 
subject to the approval of the 
President, may be transferred 
either to the department of in- 
struction and information in the 
Philippines, or a division of infor- 
mation which may be created in 
the office of the resident commis- 
sioner to the United States. 

New feature of the reorgani- 
zation was the creation of an in- 
formation department as part of 
the department of public instruc- 
tion. The secretary will have two 
under-secretaries, one for informa- 
tion and another for instruction.

The Example of Manila 

Under the leadership of the 
United States Army, Manila has 
already begun to dig itself out of 
its rums and Lay the foundations 
of the great city which will again 
rise on the banks of the Pauig* 
For although the Japanese could, 
and dtd t destroy great portions of 
tlie city, they could not extinguish 
the spirit of Filamerican coopera- 
tion which made Manila a world 
metropolis. 

Even a casual trip to the city 
shows how much progress has been 
made in the past few days. Ths 
l J asig river has been bridged, of- 
fice buildings have been reoccupied, 
rubble has been cleared away, 
streets are be^ng reasphalted r wa- 
ter runs in the city mains, and at 
least two major hotels are partial- 
ly in use. Small stores are open- 
ing up, restaurants are doing 
business, and public markets are 
again beginning to display their 
wares* 

What a contrast there is between 
ths way the Japanese and the 
American armies itave operated in 
Manila! The Japs found the city 
a going concern, and promptly be- 
gan to loot it systematically. The 
Americans found Manila a ruined 
mass of wreckage, and promptly 
began to rebuild it* 

If the world needed any proof 
of Japan's hatred and contempt for 
the Filipinos* or of America's real 
friendship, it need only look to 
Manila.

News of the World by Cable 



LONDON — Growing dissention 
within Germany was indicated 
strongly this week in news reports 
which trickled from the Reich in 
spite of iron- clad censorship- 
Moscow Radio said that Nazi 
sailors in north German coastal 
towns openly resisted Gestapo of- 
ficers. Other reports claim that 
convalescent homes near the Swiss 
frontier were filling up with high 
Nazi party officials and their fa- 
milies. German leaders were try- 
ing to conceal the flight of offi- 
cials who deserted their posts in 
the face of danger.

at his office yesterday at Ma-

Yanks Drive 50 Miles In 
58 Hours To Reach Rhine 



PARIS — German lines cracked 
wide open south of Cologne Thurs- 
day under the explosive impact of 
an armored thunderbolt fashioned 
by General FatLon's U. S. Third 
Army, which raced eastward 50 
miles in 58 hours to reach the 
Rhine near the important river 
port of Coblenz. 

Speeding Third Army columns 
met only "slight resistance" dis^ 
patches said, and American com- 
manders were "puzzled by the 
failure of the Germans to put up 
a fight." Hundreds of Nazis sur- 
rendered along the entire Western 
Front, as the total since the Nor- 
mandy landing* Hat June passed

headquarters announced. 

Routed German forces fleeing 
before the Third Army thrust

and hundreds of vehicles intact, 
with their gasoline tanks dry, in. 
eluding 200 in a single group. 

For 100 miles along the west 
bank of the Rhine, American and 
Canadian troops were drawn up in

The Government-in -Exile 

With the swearing in of Pres- 
ident Osmcna'e WW cabinet* the 
first Philippine gcvernment-in- 
exifo passes out of the picttcre. 
This was the government that 
President Quezon, at the behest of 
President Roosevelt and General 
Mae Arthur, led to the United 
States. It is the government iftat 
continued under President Osviena, 
when President Quezon died f and 
it is the government that returned 
to the shores of Lcyte the day that 
the first American troops landed 
on Philippine soil. 

The Filipino people know little 
of their govemment-in-exile. For 
under Japanese military censor- 
ship they had no chance to learn 
what Quezon, Osmena, Romulo s 
V aides, Hernandez and the other a 
lucre doing in the United States, 
President Osmena's speech yester- 
day set the record clear. 

In clear and unequivocal terms 
he told how the gevernmenUin- 
exile had lifted the Philippines 
into full membership in the United 
Nations, how it had planned the 
economic rehabilitation of the Phil- 
ippines, how it had speeded up the 
date of independence and secured 
pledges that independence would be 
guaranteed and protected. 

The list of accomplishments is 
an imposing one, Handicapped by 
lack of personnel, working in a 
country that was sympathetic but 
extremely busy with its own pro* 
blems, the Quczon-Osmena govern* 
ment'in-exile achieved results that 
will redound to the benefit of the 
Philippines for decades to come* 
It deserves the heartfelt apprecia- 
tion of the entire Filipino people.

American troops liberated two 
more Philippine towns and drove 

^TYw^° r€ than mflet 
on both the northern and southern 
sectors of the Luzon front, Gen- 
eral MacArthur's Friday commit 
mque announced. 

The 33rd division, punching up 
the narrow coastal plain north of 
Rosano, La Union, gained twelve 
miles to capture Aringay and se- 
cure the line from Tubao through 
Pugo to Twin Peaks, in Benguet 
sub-province. The 11th Airborne 
division made an overnight ad* 
vance of thirteen miles east from 
Balayan bay, seizing Lemery, thir- 
teen miles from Batangas, 

The 1st Cavalry and 6th Infan- 
try continued active patrolling 
along the Antipolo-Wawa Line, 
east of Manila. All other sectors 
were quiet- Heavy units and dive 
bombers on successive days 
pounded Jap installations along 
the heavily defended line with more 
than 1,000 tons of bombs. 

Far East Air force planes again 
attacked enemy positions on Cebu 
and Mindanao, dropping 129 tons 
on barracks and supply areas at 
Zamboang^a, 

Fighters and medium bombers 
swept Formosa and the China 
Sea, wrecking twelve grounded 
Jap planes at Samah, Hainan- In 
dogfights with 25 enemy fighters, 
five were shot down and four 
more listed as prbbables. Th £ e ? 
American bombers were shot 
down over the target. Night pa- 
trol planes destroyed a 1UAHJU

net at Malacanan Thursday The 
ceremony was held in the cur- 
ajnedi chandeliered, brown and 
white room of the old Council of 
btate. 

American and Filipino officers 
war correspondents, photographers^ 
and friends and intimates of the 
new officials, thronged the lighted 
room to witness the induction 
which was scheduled for 10 a,m. 
but took place at 11. 

Baron gs and a number of shark- 
skin coats relieved the monotony 
of khaki which the majority wore. 
The glitter and flash of the former 
occupant of the place was miss- 
ing, replaced by the sobriety and 
calm of the new white-haired 
chief of state. The cabinet mem- 
bers filtered into the room, shook 
hands with friends, waited for the 
President who entered last The 
oath of office was read by the 
President, the cabinet members 
repeating after him, with hands 
upraised. 

The news photographers went 
into action, punctuating the of- 
ficial declaration of loyalty and 
allegiance with the flash of their 
bulbs. The oath taking was con- 
cluded but the photographers were 
not satisfied. They wanted more 
pictures. They got the pictures, 
the President and the cabinet mem- 
bers obliging and raising their 
hands in the act of taking oath. 
When the Commonwealth officials 
thought they had posed long

. GUAM — United States Ma-

of pillboxes at the northern tip of 
SSL Jima Thursday, to move 
within a few hundred yards of the 
north coast. 

Japanese defenders, entrenched 

i *k k uses with their backs 
to the sea, showed no sign of col- 
lapse as they met the Marine at- 
tack with intense small arms and 
machmegun fire. Gains were 
made tip to 500 yards in hand-to- 
hand combat, but there was no 
general advance. Every step was 
being contested bitterly by a foe 
who has I Bt two thirds of an ori-

Of Cologne 

. PARIS — American troops hur- 
dled the great Rhine River barrier 
m great force" Thursday to score 
their greatest victory of the light- 
ning Allied offensive on the West- 
ern Front, 

Military disaster confronted 
Germany ns First Army troops 
spanned the Rhine south of Co- 
logne with such swiftness that de- 
fenders were caught unprepared 
and offered only light opposition, 

The initial assault troops met 
little enemy artillery or mortar 
fire, quickly established a firm 
bridgehead, and fanned out as a 
steady Btream of men and supplies 
poured across the Rhine* The 
Rhine was bridged by the same 
First Army force which captured 
and cleared the great Rhineland 
fortress city of Cologne only two 
days before, 

Farther south, other First Army 
columns occupied over half of the 
industrial center of Bonn, and 
moved within 45 miles of a junction 
with the U. S. Third Army which 
reached the Rhine near Coblenz 
after a spectacular dash of 60 milea 
in 58 hours. 

Front line dispatches gave a vi- 
vid picture of German disintegra- 
tion along the crumbling Western 
front Thousands of Germans 
were surrendering without a fight. 
Scenes along the corridor to the 
Rhine were described as ''utterly 
fantastic," German civilians look- 
ing on in amazement as long lines 
of American tanks, mobile guns, 
and trucks rolled by without end 
The total number of German pri- 
soners jumped past 1,000,000 at 
the end of Thursday's fighting.

as of February 1, 1945, Included 
in the new program are large and 
escort carriers, heavy and light

Loyalty Was Tue 
Fii&t Test 



In the formation o\f his new 
cabinet, President Sergio Osmena 
obviously adhered to a strict po- 
licy of not selecting men who ser- 
ved under Laurel's puppet regi- 
me* Loyalty to the Filipino people 
wa& the first test he applied to 
prospective appointees* 

For immediate co-workers, the 
President chose men who remained 
faithful to the peoples resistance 
against the Japanese* 

The new cabinet members are 
men who stood against the invader 
either on ttataan or Vorreyuwr, 
with the guerrillas in Uie nam, 
with the exile government in Was- 
hington, or who simply refused to 
accept any post in ttie Japaue&v- 
erffftted hepubuo, or cuope/uie tn 
any way with the invader. 

Not all members of tlie new ca- 
binet are well-known. Some of the 
best minds of the country nave un- 
fortunately not been jarthjul tv 
democratic ideals. 2 he public 
however may rest assured thai titt 
new department heads are men who 
have kept their hands clean, whose 
first ambition is to serve their 
people well. 

Grave responsibilities rest on the 
newly-appointed cabinet. Unaer 
its direction, the frame-work 0/ the 
Commonwealth, bom of the btoou 
of countless heroes, shall be res- 
tored. Those who have given theh 
lives that the Commonwealth ma% 
be re-established may rest assurea 
that collaborators shall have no 
share in the new government 
Leadership belongs to those who 
were bravc t patriotic and true. 



City Treasurer's OJjict 
Reorganized Ihh h 



The organization of the Manila 
city treasurer's office was begun 
early this week as a preliminary 
to the establishment of the entire 
city government, Tomas Confcsor, 
secretary of interior stated yester- 
day. 

A reorganized city treasurer's 
office is of pa 1 amount importance 
he said. Market vendors desiring 
to open stalls in the public mar- 
kets, cannot secure them without 
licenses* Store owners who want 
to reopen their shops and do 
business cannot do so in a legiti- 
mate way- The same may be said 
of lawyers, doctors, pharmacists, 
and other professions and callings. 

A decision will bo made in the 
next few days as to where licenses 
may procured* A temporary office 
will be set up in a day or so, Mr. 
Confesar stated, He also said that 
there is no definite information 
yet regarding the seat of the city 
government* It is not sure, he said, 
whether the battered City Hall can 
be utilized for office purposes,

Luzor/s Famous 
Girl Guerrilla 
Visits Manila 

Yay Panlillo, the celebrated $ 
photographer who turned mxxt 
visited Manila yesterday. Wear! 
khaki jumpers, with a cattri^ 
Belt over her shoulder, she apojl 
incessantly of the courage and shl 
of the officers and men who mat, 
up Marking's Guerrillas, ajl Cii : 
standing guerrilla band that fo^f. 
the Japanese m central Luzon fa 
nearly three years. 

Concerning herself, Yay had lit 
tie to say. But her fellow guerrj. 
]leroa f who gave her th* commi: 
sion of colonel and made her chief, 
of-staf f to Marcos V, Agustin, fa. 
der of the band, paid the higha: 
tribute to her leadership, 

'^Marking's Guerrillas were at, 
tive when Bataan fell," Yay said 
"From 17 rifles in April, £342, 
they grew to number 2,000 air, 
when the Americans retunmi, 
Counting home-guards, reserve, 
etc., they now number 2Q0 t (Xij. 
They hold several towns bahiw 
the Jap lines and they have foughi 
an unremitting war against Qu 
enemy." 

But Yay's highest praise come: 
for the men who make up Mark 
ing's Guerrillas. Marcos Agustin 
who was a bus driver, Jose Maps 
a marine engineer who is the pre

they are all mighty fine boys," si 
said. 

Asked how many Japs she h

by President Sergio Osmciia in 1

Before pinning the medal on 
Gen. MacArthur's uniform, the 
President said: "Today, the Com- 
monwealth of the Philippines is 
privileged to give due recognition 
to the valor and leadership of Gen- 

A Ta i ° f the Arm y Douglas Mac- 
Arthur, commander-in-chief of the 
forces of liberation. Through this 
decoration, the highest in the pow- 
er of the Filipino people to give, 
the Commonwealth desires to make 
patent for all the world to see our 
gratitude, our esteem, and our ad- 
miration for our true friend and 
courageous liberator." 

After the President delivered 
his speech, Secretary Tom as Cahili 
of National Defense read the cita- 
tion : 

"MacArthur, Douglas, General, 
United States Army. For extra- 
ordinary courage and valor in the 
face of overwhelming odds shown 
in Bataan and Corregidor, and ex- 
ceptional performance of service

monwealth of the Philippines. 
Under his courageous leadership 
out-numbered American and Fili- 
pino troops resisted the enemy 
with such unsurpassed valor and 
heroism as have won the admira-

Americans Seize Zamboan 



No. 23 



Late Reports 
Raise Tokyo 
Damage Score 

fleet of American Super-Fort- 
resses from the Marianas applied 
the torch Monday to the industrial 
center of Nagoya, Japan's third 
largest city and the home of the 
great Mitsubishi aircraft works 
in a swift follow-up to Saturday's 
record fire bombing of Tokyo. 

A brief announcement from 
Gen. Curtis LeMay's 2 1st Bomber 
command revealed that the Nago- 
ya assault was on a scale "com- 
parable to the Tokyo attack" in 
which over 300 Super-Forts were 
employed. This meant nearly 2,000 
tons of incendiaries spread rivers 
of fire through Nagoya's factory 
districts. 

Meanwhile, official announce- 
ments from Guam revealed that 
Saturday's attack on Tokyo was 
even more, destructive than first 
announced. -Over 16 square miles 
in the heart of the city were vir- 
tually wrecked. The fires left 
only rubble and twisted steel. At 
least 18 important factories were 
ruined. Radio Tokyo said the at- 
tack lasted 2% hours, and that 
some fires still' were burning Mon- 
day, 48 hours later. 

An American pilot, one of the 
first to drop his bombs on Tokyo 
early Saturday morning, said: 
"The city was blacked out when 
we first arrived. But the first 
load lit up the whole town, send- 
ing flames rising as high as 10,000 
feet. I could see three or four 
miles of flames when we left* ■- 

Gen- LeMay declared that Sa- 
turday's Tokyo attack "will short- 
en the war in the Pacific*"

Americans Widen Bridgehead 
Across Rhine, Trap Nazi Force 



Marines Break 
Japanese Lines 
In I wo Battle 

K^°± , JIM 4— American Marines 
broke through Japanese lines Sun- 
day to capture most of the eastern 
coast of Iwo Jima, splitting the re- 
maining defenders into three 
groups, Pacific Fleet headquar- 
ters announced. 

O* 1 ^ Marine unit drove forward 
BOO yards, compressing the Jap- 
anese into small pockets, and 
maintained steady pressure under 
the supporting blows of Navy Bur- 
face and carrier plane bombard- 
ments. Over 500 Japs were wiped 
out when Marines repulsed a des- 
perate enemy infiltration attempt 
which preceded the breakthrough. 

Daring Thrust 
Took Rhine Span 
From Germans 

PARIS — Daring armored infan- 
trymen of the Ninth Armored divi- 
sion captured the double-tracked 
Ludendorf bridge at Remagen just 
10 minutes before the Germans 
were scheduled to blow up the 
structure, according to the United 
Press. Then the troops raced 
swiftly along its 1,200 feel length 
into the steep cliffs of Erpel, 276 
miles southwest of Berlin and 30 
southeast of Cologne, 

Some explosions accompanied the 
Ninth division spurt across the 
Rhine and caused slight damage to 
the bridge. Wires attached to ex- 
plosive charges were cut before 
anything more than superficial 
damage occurred. 

First Army headquarters said 
the taking of the important bridge 
undoubtedly changed the entire 
complexion of the war in the west 
both for the Americans and the 
Germans, The Nazis did not ex- 
pect U. S. troops to get across the 
Rhine at Remagen because of the 
hilly terrain opposite the bridge- 
head* _^ 

NEW YORK— The Soviet news 
azency Tass disclosed that Tokyo 
newspapers failed to publish Sun- 
day following the B-29 raid on 

BP SSmm ******* 



PARIS— American First Army 
troops expanded their Remagen 
bridgehead across the Rhine Sun- 
day to an area nine miles long and 
three miles deep, and made junc- 
tion with the U. S. Third Army to 
the south, trapping several Ger- 
man divisions on the western aide 
of the Rhine. 

Fanning out above and below 
the Remagen bridge which fell in- 
tact. First Army columns cap- 
tured eight more German towns 
on the eastern side of the Rhine, 
and moved in artillery to urotcct 
their bridgehead. Frontline dis- 
patches wrote that roadways were 
jammed with thousands of men 
and supplies "all headed for Re- 
magen." 

To the south, First Army unite 
linked lip with Third Army tanks, 
trapping thousands of German 
troops caught in between. The 
Third Army cleared an 18-mile 
stretch of the Moselle River 
stretching south from Coblenz, and 
captured an important town di- 
rectly across the Moselle from 
Coblenz. 

To the north, British and Amer- 
ican troops wiped out the last Ger- 
man defenders in the Wosel poc- 
ket, giving General Eisenhower's 
Armies undisputed control of more 
than 150 miles of the west bank 
of the Rhine. 

Air operations reached a new 
crescendo Sunday when R.A.F. 
heavies unloaded 5,000 tons of 
bombs on the Ruhr arsenal city of 
Essen as over 1,200 U. S- bombers 
— -in a sky train 200 miles long- 
pounded oil refineries and subma- 
rine yards at Hamburg, Kiel, and 
Bremen in northeastern Germany.

advocates the nationalization of 
important public services, and di- 
rect government development Of

Confesor proposes the adoption 
of the 4€-hour week, health pro- 
tection measures in factories, mills 
and wines, the abolition of child 
labor, equal pay for men and wo- 
men, and vocational schools tor

Taxes should raise "adequate

traordinary enterprises of the 
state," They should "prevent the 
concentration of wealth m the 
hands of a few."

Hitlers "Supermen" 
Fled from Cologne 

COLOGNE— The so-called Nari 

"Supermen," like their Bushido 
counterparts in Japan, turn out 
to be less than ordinary people 
when confronted with the pressing 
problem of saving their own skins. 

How "Hitler's Supermen" in 
Cologne deserted their people three 
days before the Americans entered 
the Rhineland fortress was told by 
Louis Lochner, Associated Press 
correspondent. The story is one of 
the tragedies of Cologne. 

"Nazidom's administrators," h« 
wrote, "could not take the satura- 
tion bombing of Friday, March 2. 
Supermen began scurrying for the 
interior of the Reich on that day 
and the last of them left Satur- 
day. 

"In their haste, they provoked a 
major tragedy. Various citizens 
with whom I have talked said 
there was one final mass exodus 
after last Friday's heavy air at- 
tack. Thousands of nerve-wracked 
Cologners used the only bridge 
available — of limited capacity — 
which spanned the Rhine near the 
new market place. 

"Heavy vehicles were forbidden 
specifically, but the Nazi hierar- 
chy ordered trucks over the span. 
Suddenly the bridge snapped and 
sank into the river. Just how 
many fugitive civilians were killed 
probably will never be known." 



Japs on Iwo Jima Will Fight 
To Last Man, Nimitz Predicts 



Navy Gets Cargo Ships 

WASHINGTON — Twenty-nine 
of the 125 merchant ships built in 
American shipyards during Feb- 
ruary were turned over to the 
Army and Navy for military use, 
the Maritime Commission an- 
nounced. 

February's total output was 
1,300,000 deadweight tons. Nine- 
teen ships were built as military 
types and ten were merchantmen 
converted to military ttse. Other 
merchant sLipa &sUre*£d iwi 



WASHINGTON— Fleet Admiral 
Chester W. Nimitz, in a navy de- 
partment press conference here, 
said he expects the Japanese 
on Iwo Jima to continue their 
fight until "the last Japanese 
is killed, wounded or captured." 

Nimitz told the newsmen that 
he was in Washington for a con- 
ference with Fleet Admiral Ernest 
J. King, commander in chief of 
the United States fleet and chief 
of naval operations. 

Nimitz extended another invita- 
tion to the Japanese fleet to come 
out and fight at the earliest pos- 
sible moment. 

He said that remnants of the 
Japanese fleet were in Japanese 
empire waters adjacent to the Ja- 
panese horneland when he first 
issued the invitation. At the same 
time Nimitz warned that, rightly 
used, these remnants could be an 
effective deterrent to any attempts 
at landing on the Japanese home 
islands. 



Pointing out that Iwo Jima is 

only 650 miles from Japan, Mimitz 
predicted that future B-29 opera- 
tions over Japanese industrial 
areas would prove to be more ef- 
fective than in the past, because 
they would be protected by fighter 
planes based on Iwo. 

Discussing the overall strategy 
for the final conquest of Japan, 
Nimitz said, "I believe that we 
should plan the war against Japan 
in such a manner that our chances 
of success are greatest and our 
casualties least." 

At this point he added: "We 
need more than one position — in 
fact, a number of positions," to 
launch the final assault on the Ja- 
panese homeland. He continued: 
"It is my belief that some of these 
positions may be in China." Nimitz 
said that the British fleet is sche- 
duled to take part in closing the 
Pacific campaign against the Ja- 
panese "in a manner that will 
greatly contribute to the success 
of the operations." 



MacArihvr Accepts 
Church Belief Offer 

Gen. Douglas MacArthur ex- 
pressed strong approval of the Ca- 
tholic Welfare Organization and 
its aims, in the course of a half- 
hour conference Friday between 
the general and the Very Rev. 
John F. Hurley, S. J., Secretary- 
General of the organization. 

The Catholic Welfare Organiza- 
tion, Fr. Hurley told the Gen- 
eral, is the entire Catholic Church 
in the Philippines, organized not 
as an independent relief organiza- 
tion but as an entity to afford all 
possible aid, in properties and per- 
sonnel, to the military and civil 
authorities in the present emer- 
gency. 

General MacArthur, in accept- 
ing this offer, made a number of 
suggestions. He particularly era-

Co'ogn^ Cathedral 
Stanch Intact 
Above Ruins of City 

(Here is an eyewitness descrip- 
tion of Cologne by DON WHITE- 
HEAD. Associated Press Corres- 
pondent) : , 5 

COLOGNE— Doughboys walking 
through the streets of Cologne 
looked up today from the aw- 
ful wreckage of a ruined city 
to see the miracle of the cathedral 
with its awesome spires standing 
above the distortion wrought by 
Allied air raids. 

Those fragile beautiful spires, 
mellowed by the weather of seven 
centuries, rose straight into the 
heavens out of the most terrible 
destruction yet witnessed by these 
American troops who have seen 
the rubble of many blasted cities. 

All around the ancient edifice 
the heart of Cologne lay in waste. 
Block upon block there was noth- 
ing but the gutted skeletons of 
buildings and debris piled many 
feet high. Tons of bombs had 
ripped out the heart of Cologne, 
Great chunks of concrete had been 
tossed about like pebbles. Huge 
steel girders Jay twisted like hair- 
pins. 

Yet in this devastation was the 
miracle of the dome. Seven times 
; in two years the famous cathedral 
had been hit by bombs, yet it 
j stood with remarkably little se- 
' rious damage to its Gothic beauty. 
How it survived while everything 
around it was laid waste, no one 
can say. 

There was a report before the 
doughboys entered, that the old 
part of the city was 09 percent in 
ruins. Almost everyone scoffed at 
the claim as an exaggeration. But 
none who walked through the old 
city doubted that figure. 

Most of the streets were piled 
high with debris. In two hours

JAPAN'S "CVLTLRAL" PROGRAM 

During the Japanese occupation, the invaders did not « » »«J* 
seek to replace Western culture in the Philippines nthjte 
as to destroy all culture and reduce the Filipinos to mass 
and unquestioning slavery - as Herbert Zipper, u>elL-kn*wn conductor 
of the Manila Symphony Orchestra, declared in ^^^^^ 

Books, whethsr sympathetic to democracy or the totalitarian state, 
were burned when the Japanese came in. The few books that were 
spared were intended to enable the regime to keep up the pretense or 
education. There was a deliberate and systematic campaign to limit 
Filipino culture to the ability to read a few Japanese character* for 
the receipt and execution of Japanese orders. 

Dr. Zipper pointed out that any cultural project the Japanese spon- 
sored or allowed was intended as propaganda or for Japanese home con- 
mimption. The people in Japan must remain convinced that the Jap- 
anese militarists were bringing civilization to the Filipinos. 

The Japanese sought to replace serious Western music with a few 
Japanese tunes, and when the plan failed, gave most of the musical 
portion of their radio broadcasts to jazz. But "since the Japanese 
came," once observed the Osaka Mainichi, "Filipinos are hearing the 
best of Oriental and Occidental music instead of vulgar jazz" As an 
example of this, a Japanese cultural mission gave two concerts in Ma- 
nila in November 1043 r featuring among other things the Second Rhap- 
sody of Liszt and the Cradle Song of Brahms as rendered by a xylo- 
phonist to orchestral accompaniment* — as startling a performance as 
n. tightrope act in a batteU 

The Japanese propaganda office continually played up the theme 
of how Japanese art and music were being brought to the Filipinos by 
their generous allies and friends. But it was no secret to Filipinos 
that tfis Jap militarists had adopted a policy of utilizing cultural and 
pseudo-cultural media, like all the other facilities they could lay hands 
on, as additional tools of Japanese imperialism.

Navy fighter pilots of Air Group 
20, while attached to an Essex

troops, giving the Germans no

lines in the West, opened a larse

the Rhine River Monday from 
their expanding Remagen brid^

Hundreds of American big mms, 
emplaced on the west bank of the 
Rhine and inside the bridgehead, 
preceded the assault with heavy 
shelling of German positions, 
while infantry struck forward 
above and below Remagen, behind 
tanks. The bridgehead was widen- 
ed to an area 4% miles deep and 
11 miles long, and American 
forces seized approaches to the su- 
per-highway running north to the 
vital Ruhr district.

Returning pilots sard that fires 
were plainly visible throughout 
Nagoya 's industrial district* where

cated. General LeMay, comment- 
ing on the assault, described it as 
"equally successful as Saturday's 
smash at Tokyo/ 1 in which 15

tal were laid waste. He added: 

"All that the Japanese now 
have to look forward to is the de-

WASHINGTON - "A™*^ 

cause, Manila editor and 

P&pine Commonwealth, de- 
clared yesterday. 

Steffan traced the excellent 
work of the guerrillas during the 
S5«i« occupation s the seizing of 
iSd and munitions, the rescue of 
Sners, the execution of Bpies, 
the harassing of Japanese commu- 
tations and the extension of aid 
to U. S, landing forces. 

Stoifan concluded with the 
etatement that in the United 
qtatcs people are cheered by the 
Sews of such vital guerrilla 
achievements as those in the coasts 
S province of Ilocos Norte where, 
through successful guerrilla ac- 
tion, thousands of Japanese sol- 
diers have been killed in moun- 
tains which the Japanese them- 
selves considered as "impregnable 
fortresses."

Irving Berlin Presents New 
Song to People of Philippines 



_ TOLOSA, LEYTE— Irving Ber- 
lin's new song of freedom, 
4 Heaven Watch the Philippines," 
was formally presented to the Fi- 
ipino people last Saturday as a 
featured part of Berlin's show, 
'This is the Army," now touring 
Leyte. 

The famous composer, who was 
inspired to write "Heaven Watch 
the Philippines' 1 after hearing a 
group of Filipino children on Ley- 
te substitute the word "Philip- 
pines" in "God Bless America," 
dedicated his new composition to 
General MacArthur. In response, 
General MacArthur sent Berlin 
the following message from his 
headquarters on Luzon: 

"The commander-in-chief appre- 
ciates greatly the distinction of 
the dedication of a song by so dis- 
tinguished an author and pro- 



ducer as Mr. Berlin * He is deeply 
grateful to him, not only for tbat, 
but for the magnificent aid he 
is rendering the Allied cause." 

Here are the words of Berlin's 
new song: 

Heaven watch the Philippines, 
Keep her tafe from harm; 
Guard her tons — and their 

precious ones 
In the city and on the farm; 
Friendly with America 
Let her always be, 
Heaven watch the Philippine* 
And keep her forever free, 
And keep her forever free, 

(Copyright Irving Berlin, 1946) 

Berlin predicted that in the 
Philippines, the new song would 
outrank even his "God Bless Ame- 
rica" in emotional appeal.

Health Board 
To Emphasize 
Sanitation Need 



With the reestablishment of the 
health department of the City of 
Manila, Colonel Maurice C. Pin- 
coffs, M.C., director, has asked for 
public cooperation with the depart- 
ment's program of sanitation as a 
first step in warding off epidemic 
disease. 

In accordance with the request 
of President Osmeiia, the health 
department is being reconstituted 
under the Civil Affairs Section of 
the United States Army which is 
supplying equipment, medical sup- 
plies and transportation, jfc'ollow- 
ing the period of emergency, the 
department will revert to city au- 
thorities. 

Colonel Pincoffs stated that the 
most pressing problems of the de- 
partment are those of sanitation, 
control of communicable diseases 
and medical care of the wounded 
and sick. 

The health director urged that 
all civilians pay special attention 
to the disposal of garbage and hu- 
man waste. The spreading of these 
over the city streets and open 
ground, he aid, breeds flies which 
spread enteric diseases. He advised 
residents in areas where garbage 
collection had been resumed to 
place all garbage in receptacles at 
the edge of sidewalks; in areas not 
yet served, garbage should be 
buried deeply* 

The health department head 
warned that the city water is not 
yet safe to drink, and water from 
shallow wells is highly polluted. He 
explained that - although the city 
water is safe at its source, it is 
polluted on its way through pipe 
lines which have not yet been com- 
pletely checked. Health officials 
said that all water for drinking 
and for use in the preparation of 
food must be boiled. 

The central office of the health 
department has been temporarily 
established in the administration 
building of the San Lazaro Hospi- 
tal T&e dtjr w£S subdivided into

Seize 2 More Islands 



Romblon and 
Simara Taken 
Near Mindoro 



Generals Krueger, Kenney 
Raised to Four-Star Rank 



American Eighth Army troops 
have seized two more islands in 
the Philippines in the first re- 
ported amphibious landing made 
at night, General MacArthur's 
communique announced this morn- 
ing. Troops of the 24th division 
went ashore on Romblon and Si- 
mara islands, in the Visayas, east 
of Mindoro. 

Today's communique said the 
landings were effected at night 
"thereby attaining complete tacti- 
cal surprise." The enemy garrison 
at Romblon was destroyed. 

Elsewhere in the Philippines, 
XIV Corps units fighting south 
and east of Manila, captured three 
more villages, further securing 
the road network south of Laguna 
de Bay and driving deeper into 
the Marikina watershed area. 

General MacArthur announced 
earlier another air strike at Ja- 
panese shipping off Formosa and 
the China coast. Fighter bomber? 
caused heavy explosions at the 
Takao hydro-electric plant on 
Formosa, started large fires among 
railway installations at Taito, and 
sank or damaged a 3,000-ton ene- 
my freighter, a landing barge and 
three luggers off Hongkong and 
Tourane, French Indo-Cnina. 

Australian ground troops in 
New Guinea, New Britain and 
Bougainville have killed an ad- 
ditional 1,029 Japanese of the 
by-passed enemy garrisons. 

Three Russian Armies 
Threaten Nazi Capital 

MOSCOW— Three powerful Red 
Armies were poised along the east 
bank of the curving Oder River 
Wednesday for a direct assault on 
Berlin, front dispatches said. 

There was no official report of 
any crossing of the Oder, but the 
Associated Press revealed Russian 
heavy guns were firing from the 
ruins of captured Kustrin, 38 miles 
east of the German capital . 

Field reports made it plain that 
the Germans have assembled great 
concentrations of fighting reserves 
west of the Oder to meet the Rus- 
sians.

3d 2000 Ton 
Raid by B2o's 
In Five Days 

=i GUAM — Another fleet of Amer- 
j ican Super Fortresses stabbed 
| through the night skies over Japan 
ll early yesterday to cascade 2,000 
tons of incendiary bombs on Osaka, 
Japan's second largest city, as the 
systematic campaign to raze the 
enemy's tinderbox arsenals assum- 
ed record proportions. 

It was the third mass fire bomb- 
ing of Japan's industrial centers in 
five days. A 20th Air Force bul- 
letin from Washington described 
Wednesday's B-29 task force as 
"very large," indicating there were 
as many planes as the 300 or more 
which fired Tokyo early Saturday, 
and hit Nagoya early Monday. 

Taking off in relays from run- 
ways on Tinian, Saipan, and Guam 
in the Marianas, the Super Forts 
concentrated clusters of 500-pound 
fire bombs for 90 minutes on a 10- 
square-mile section of Osaka, drop- 
ping down to 5,000 feet to pinpoint 
iron, steel, aluminum, airplane and 
machine tool works. The target 
a^ea is crammed with over 52,000 
factories. 

Osaka, with a population of over 
3,000,000, is the most densely pop- 
ulated city in Japan, and one of 
its most important sources of wea- 
pons. Lying 245 miles west of To- 
kyo and 85 miles below Nagoya, 
Osaka is also the hub of main rail- 
way lines and overseas shipping.

WASHINGTON — Lieutenant | 
Generals George C. Kenney and 
Walter Krueger — General Mac- 
Arthur's top air and ground chiefs

dent Roosevelt Tuesday for four- 
star rank in the U. S. Army. 

The names of seven other lieute- 
nant generals were sent to the 
Senate for approval of promotion 
to full general. 

Gen. Krueger, veteran field 
commander of the U. S. Sixth 
Army, which has successfully en- 
gineered more amphibious landings 
than any other fighting groups m 
modern history, set the ground 
pace in the American offensive

New Soviet Push 

MOSCOW— The dorrnant war 
sector at Berlin's back door flared 
into violence Monday as ^ 
shock troops captured the Uder 
River fortress of Kustnn, only 38 
miles east of the, German capital. 
Seizure of Kustnn gave tbe Red 
Army solid control of the east 
bank of the Oder River from 
Kustrin to the shores of Stettin 
Bay, the port of Berlin on the 
Baltic. Elsewhere on the eastern 
front, other Russian columiiB drove

FREE PHILIPPINES 



Manila Police Training School 
Opens With 1,000 Recruits 



Page S 



With its first quota of 1,000 stu- 
dents filled, the Manila Police 
training school began operation 
yesterday as a division of the Ma- 
nila police department. Col. Mau- 
rice Ellis Jones, deputy provost 
marshal genera! and chief of the 
Manila police, appointed Col. T. 
J. Grayson, commandant of the 
school. Colonel Grayson is respon- 
sible for bringing the police 'force 
to its authorized strength of 1,500 
men. 

In the selection of the 1,000 po- 
lice rookies, emphasis was placed 
on their physical condition, moral 
character and background, and 
their educational attainments. 

Colonel Grayson opened his 
school on Rizal Avenue north of 
the railroad track. Present plans 
call for a four-week training 
course under instructors chosen 
from the legal profession as well 
as from the U. S. Army and the 
ranks of the Philippine Scouts. 
The instruction will cover laws 
and legal orders, police rules and 
regulations, training in the use of 
shotguns, revolvers, and pistols, 
and military drill. 

At the end of the four-week 
training period, the young police- 
man will be given the rank of sec- 
ond class patrolman. "However, 
at this time he will not be a full- 
fledged police officer," Colonel 
Grayson said. For a period of six 
months the recruit will be on a 
probationary basis. Only those 
men who pass the final tests with 
flying colors will be retained. 



In the interests of public 
health, the United States Army 
has started a street sprinkling 
service in Manila to minimize the 
dust menace. Some Army trucks 
have been converted into sprin- 
klers. One handicap, however, is 
the shortage of water. 



Noted Lu^on Guerrilla 
Visits Manila Units 



Marcos Villa Agustin, better 
known as the commander of "Mark- 
ing's Guerrillas" boasting a combat 
strength of approximately 200,000 
men, yesterday paid a social call 
on his guerrilla units scattered 
throughout Manila. As the "terror 
of the Japs," Villa Agustin's repu- 
tation has spread throughout Cen- 
tral Luzon. 

Villa Agustin said he had been 
assured- that his guerrillas will be 
formed into a regular regiment of 
the USAFFE. The unit, he added, 
will be called the "Yay Regiment," 
in honor of Yay Panlilio, the 
well-known girl photographer who 
turned guerrilla and stayed in 
the hills for almost three years 
with Villa Agustin and his men. 

A bus driver at the outbreak of 
the war, Villa Agustin, with 17 
companions, organized a resistance 
movement in the hills of Rizal 
province shortly before the fall of 
Bataan. Repeated.y, the Japs urged 
him to collaborate. But he deiied 
them and silenced Jap and Filipino 
emissaries who tried to persuade 
him to support Nippon. 

Once he bluntly told a Jap of- 
ficer: "There can be no compro- 
mise for me. If you get me, you 
win. But if I get you iirst. . ." 

Before leaving the hills of Baras, 
Rizal, which had been his home for 
three years, Villa Agustin and his 
men took the following oath: "We 
heieby pledge ourselves with undy- 
ing faith and loyalty to the cause 
of freedom. We will continue to 
fight side by side with our Amer- 
ican brothers-in-arms until this 
war is won."

Municipal Court Handling 
Many Petty Theft Cases Here 



RECONSTRUCTION IN MANILA — The city isn't pretty to look 
at, but it is coming back to life. Here UJ3. Signal Corps linemen string i 
telephone mr«. J 



Petty theft cases are flooding 
the Manila municipal courts, ac- 
cording to Judge Mariano Nable 
whose sala is located on the sec- 
ond floor of the former BiHbid 
prison. 

Since he was inducted into of- 
fice on March 7, Judge Nable has 
decided 39 petty larceny cases. In 
many instances the accused per- 
sons were Filipino laborers work- 
ing for the army, some were ha- 
bitual criminals who had looted 
offices and abandoned homes in 
the burned areas of the city. 

Jud e Nable said some people 
steal Army property because they 
mistakenly believe the Army is so 
lenient it will not impose a heavy 
penalty on thieves. In a case of 
petty theft he decided recently, an 
Army sergeant — the principal wit- 
ness — apologized to the judge for 
the accused who had pilfered some 
canned food. 

Incidentally, Judge Nable's sala 
is bare, without a platform for his 
table, and benches or chairs for 
the accused and the witnesses. 
Nevertheless, cases, are decided 
just as fast as they are filed. 

Up to the present time, there 
are only two municipal courts for 
Greater Manila. The other sala 
is presided over by Judge Guiller- 
mo Cabrera. Greater Manila in- 
cludes Caloocan, San Pedro Maka- 
ti, Paranaque, Mandaluyong, San 
Juan, Paaay and Quezon City, 



World Ail Treaty 

WASHINGTON — President 
Roosevelt sent to the United 
Stales Senate for ratification 
Tuesday the international civil 
aviation treaty drawn up at a 
conference in Chicago last Decem- 
ber, laying down rules for post- 
war air traffic. Twenty-six other 
nations must ratify the treaty be- 
fore it goes into effect. 

Army Filling Water 
Needs in Some Areas 



In the few sections of Manila 
which have as yet no water serv- 
ice, the United States Army is 
filling the need by maintaining 
huge canvas tanks at strategic 
places where city residents may 
draw water for all purposes. Wa- 
ter from these tanks may be used 
for drinking after it has been 
boiled. Most Manilans, however, 
get their drinking water from ar- 
tesian wells. 

Keeping the canvas water tanks 
full is a tedious, day-long job. 
Big military trucks keep the 
tanks filled or nearly full by car- 
rying water from depots operated 
by the army. The people flock 
around the canvas ,tanks from

3d 2000 Ton 
Raid by B2o's 
In Five Days 

GUAM— Another fleet of Amer- 
ican Super Fortresses stabbed 
through the night skies over Japan 
early yesterday to cascade 2,000 
tons of incendiary bombs on Osaka, 
Japan's second largest city, as the 
systematic campaign to raze th« 
enemy's tindeibox arsenals assum- 
ed record proportions. 

It was the third mass fire bomb- 
ing of Japan's industrial centers in 
five days. A 20th Air Force bul- 
letin from Washington described 
Wednesday's B-2d task force as 
"very large," indicating there were 
as many planes as the 300 or more 
which fired Tokyo early Saturday, 
and hit Nagoya early Monday. 

Taking off in relays from run- 
ways on Tinian, Saipan, and Guam 
in the Marianas, the Super Ports 
concentrated clusters of 500-pound 
fire bombs for 90 minutes on a 10- 
squa re-mile section of Osaka, drop- 
ping down to 6,000 feet to pinpoint 
iron, steel, aluminum, airplane and 
machine tool works. The target 
area is crammed with over 52,000 
factories. 

Osaka, with a population of over 
3,000,000, is the most densely pop- 
ulated city in Japan, and one of 
its most important sources of wea- 
pons. Lying 245 mile* west of To- 
kyo and 85 miles below Nagoya, 
Osaka is also the hub of main rail- 
way lines and overseas shipping.

Complaints at Rent 
Racket Increasing 



While the housing problem in

every day, according to the oilic* 
of the Provost Marshal, Afcty. Lmi- 
lio Torres* who i? in charge of the 
civilian investigation section of 
that office, said that complaints 
against house owners aTe piling 
higher every day. 

According to Torres, many land- 
lords have taken the law into their 
own hands in evicting tenants, He 
cited the case of a landlord on 
Avcnida Rizal who threw two ^ra- 
dios belonging- to his tenant into 
the street because the latter would 
not move out. The outraged tenant 
reported the matter to the Office 
- of the Provoct Marshal at once, 
and was advised to file charge 
against the drastic landlord. There 
have been cases of fist fights be- 
tween house owners and tenants 
resisting eviction. 

As to the jacking up of house 
rental s, a majority of the landlords 
in Manila, Torres said, are taking 
advantage of the present housing 
shortage* Scores of cases are now 
awaiting hearing in the Provost

IILE MINDANAO COAST TAKEN 



24 Sq. Mi. of Jap Arsenals Razed 



GUAM— American Super Forts 
in the past five days dropped 6,600 
tons of fire bombs and destroyed 
more than 24 square miles of fac- 
tories and arsenals in Tokyo, Osa- 
ka, and Nagoya, Japan's three 
largest cities, 20th Bomber Com- 
mand headquarters disclosed 
Thursday. „ 

Employing over 300 Super Fort- 
resses in each of the three attacks, 
total destruction eclipsed anything 
heretofore accomplished in the Pa- 



cific war. Reconnaissance pictures 
revealed a total of 17 square miles 
destroyed in Tokyo on Saturday, 2 
square miles in Nagoya Monday, 
and five square miles in Osaka 
Wednesday at a cost of four B-29's. 

While correspondents pointed out 
the present offensive has reached 
a scale comparable to the mightiest 
air smashes in Europe, Curtis Le- 
May, chief of B-29 operations in 
the Marianas, predicted that the 



Jap homeland hasn't seen anything 
yet. 

"We are still a long way from 
attainment of our full strength/' 
he commented tersely. 

Operations reached a new peak 
Wednesday when B-29's hammered 
Osaka with 2,300 tons of fire bombs 
in a raid that lasted three hours, 
setting fires raging in a five- 
square-mile section visible 125 
miles away. 



U. S. May Send 
Ambassador To 
P. I. Before 1 946 

WASHINGTON— Plans are be- 
ing made to send an American 
ambassador rather than a high 
commissioner to the Philippines, 
the Hous* of Representatives ap- 
propriations committee was told 
Tuesday by Lawrence C. Frank, 
chief of the state department's 
foreign affairs division. 

Frank stated that the appoint- 
ment would be made when the is- 
lands become independent, and 
that it might take pUce before 
1946. . ■ . 

Details of the committee hear- 
ings, released on Wednesday, in- 
dicated that this eventuality may 
come about through legislation 
recently enacted by Congress 

"This legislation," Frank said, 
"authorizes the President to pro- 
claim the Philippines a free and 
independent country before July 
4, 1946, provided the Japanese 
are driven from the islands and 
the normal functions of govern- 
ment restored.' ' 

The spokesman presented the 
following statement prepared by 
the Philippine division of the 
state department: 

"Appropriate American author- 
ities have already evolved plans 
looking to military and civil ad- 
ministration in the islands imme- 
diately on their occupation. At 
what time after reoccupation the 
Philippines will gain their inde- 
pendence is not known, but lead- 
ers in the Commonwealth govern- 
ment, with support from highly 
placed persons in the United 
States, are hoping independence 
for the islands will be forthcom- 
ing soon after reoccupation. In 
that case it would seem advisable 
to make provision now for estab- 
lishment of an American embassy 
in Manila, with an appropriate 
staff, and to include perhaps in a 
combined office the consulate 
rjfcTiPTQl that nl at* '* 



Commonwealth Bars Civil 
Servants Who Aided Japs 



Civil service employees who 
served under the Japanese have 
lost their standing as government 
servants, Secretary Maximo Ka- 
law of the department of instruc- 
tion and information announced 
yesterday. 

"To consider that the status of 
such Filipino government em- 
ployees transcends their oath of 
allegiance, and that their status 
should continue even after the 
government which they pledged by 
oath to defend has been destroyed 
is to my mind absurd," the secre- 
tary said. "I grant that if there 
were only a change of the party 
in power, the civil service should 
continue." 

Secretary Kalaw defined the 
status of civil service employees 
who held jobs under the Japanese 
in a letter to Deputy Commissioner 
of Civil Service Amado del Rosa- 
rio. The latter had written the 
secretary in behalf of personnel 
who served under the puppet gov- 
ernment. 

Wrote Del Rosario in part: «*I 
deem it my duty to speak a word in 
behalf of the anonymous public 
servant, who now apparently faces 
the misfortune of being considered 
a 'marked man' for having con- 
sented to remain at his post dur- 
ing a critical period in the nation's 
history "• - 

"It is a basic principle," Del Ro- 
sario continued, "that, so far as 
the routine of government is con- 



cerned, the so-called classified or 
permanent branch of the civil ser- 
vice is not supposed to be affected 
by changes in the political direc- 
torship or management.*. . . Would 
it not be paradoxical, not to say 
impolitic, to have more removals 
and separations now under the 
restored Commonwealth than un- 
der the former terroristic regime?" 

In his answer, Secretary Kalaw 
said: "I should like to remind the 
civil service employees that they 
are first of all Filipino citizens who 
should, according to their oath, be 
loyal to their government, to de- 
fend it, if need be, even with their 
lives." 

Secretary Kalaw expressed the 
conviction that the invasion of the 
Philippines was not only military 
but also cultural, and that those 
who took part in encouraging and 
promoting that cultural invasion 
also helped the enemy weaken the 
people's spirit of resistance by the 
"psychology of defeatism." 

There is a proposal, according 
to Secretary Kalaw, whereby cer- 
tain employees belonging to the 
lower middle brackets may be re- 
instated or reappointed at the dis- 
cretion of each department head. 

"The greatest need of the coun- 
try now," the secretary concluded, 
"is the development of a loyal and 
patriotic citizenry that will follow 
the life of their government and 
defend it...." 



Russians Pierce Last Nazi 
Defense Lines East of Berlin 



MOSCOW — Red Army shock 
troops punctured Germany's last- 
ditch Oder River Line at captured 
Kustrin, 38 miles east of Berlin, 
Moscow press dispatches reported 
unofficially Thursday. 

The reported crossing of the 
Oder River was made two days 
after Soviet columns battered 
down the strong defenses of Kus- 
trin, in a siege that lasted three 



heads within 38 miles of the Ger- 
man capital. In the final assault 
on Kustrin, the Russians took 3,000 
prisoners including fortress com- 
mander General Kaueger. 

Soviet troops expanded offen-

Paratroopers 
Drive Ahead 
In Batangas 



American troops on Mindanao 
drove ahead in the face of increas- 
ing enemy resistance to seize 28 
miles of coastline in the Zamboan- 
ga area, General MacArthur's 
headquarters reported this morn- 
ing. 

The 41st division captured Pa- 
sananca and reached San Ramon 
and Manicahan on either side, giv- 
ing MacArthur's troops control of 
fifteen additional villages, and of 
the entire southern tip of the pen- 
insula. 

The enemy, for the first time in 
the theatre, is reported using elec- 
trically controlled land mines. 

Eighth Army units expanded 
their hold on the Zamboanga area 
of Mindanao, capturing two vil- 
lages north of the airdromes and 
seizing strongpoints five miles east 
of the city and four miles west of 
San Roque airfield. Eight enemy 
artillery batteries were silenced by 
air and naval units. 

Fourteenth corps troops on Lu- 
zon advanced east and north of 
captured Batangas town, and be- 
gan clearing the Calumpan penin- 
sula, between Batangas and Bala- 
yan bays. 

Advances were scored in the 
Marikina watershed, east of Ma- 
nila, and toward Balete pass in the 
northern Caraballo mountains. 



Americans Extend 
Newest Bridgehead 



PARIS — A major battle was 
developing east of the Rhine 
Thursday as the Germans threw 
armored infantry and aerial re- 
serves into the widening breach 
forged by U. S. First Army co- 
lumns at their Rem \gen bridge- 
head, front line dispatches re- 
ported. 

The bridgehead now extends over 
14 miles long and four and one- 
half miles deep, Allied headquar- 
ters announced. Thousands of 
fresh American troops and sup- 
plies poured across the Rhine near 
Remagen over a new pontoon 
bridge, supplementing traffic on 
the captured railway span. 

To the south, U. S. Third Army 
units continued their attack be- 
low the Moselle river, capturing 
13 towns and advancing within 
10 miles of Saarburg. Seventh 
Army forces penetrated into Ger- 
many in a four-mil* 1 hronkthrnugb

B-19 New Cargo Plane 



LOS ANGELES— Never having 
seen action as a bomber, the Doug- 
las-built B-19— still the largest 
plane in the world — is being con- 
verted into a cargo carrier for the 
U. S. Army air force. 

Since it was first sent into the 
air in 1041, the veteran giant of 
the skyways has served as an air 
force laboratory for the develop- 
ment of bombers. Many lessons 
learned in building and flying the 
have been incorporated in the 
B-29's now plastering Japan. 

Officers of the air technical ser- 
vice command estimate that aa a 
cargo carrier the huge plane can 
carry a 45,000-pound pay load.

Japs Slay Native 
Leader :1 ?n: ; hdiio^ 

MELBOURNE— "The Japanese 
treatment of prisoners of war has 
been the very antithesis of civ- 
ilized," Prime Minister John Cur- 
tin of Australia this week told 
the Australian house of represen- 
tatives. He added that in the occu- 
pied Netherlands East Indies the 
Japanese have carried out "a cam- 
paign to exterminate all likely 

leader*" . XT 

"Japanese atrocities m the N. 
E. L have been revealed by libe- 
rated Dutch and Indonesian war 
prisoners who- reached Australia," 
Curtin stated. "They say that 
many hundreds of leading Indones- 
ian intellectuals and civil admin- 
istrators have been ruthlessly 
murdered. By the middle of 1944 
the Japanese had deported more 
than one million Indonesians for 
slave labor. Conditions in the oc- 
cupied islands are too gruesome to 
be published." 

Among the Jap victims in the 
N. E. I. were 13 native rulers, pro- 
minent Chinese and Arabs, leaders 
of religious associations, and three 
Indonesian physicians. 

In Java, the Japs discovered re- 
sistance organizations among In- 
donesian railway staffs, and mass 
murders followed. Several* hun- 
dred men were liberated by daring 
dashes through Jap-held sectors of 
New Guinea to inland prison 
camps. 

Guerrilla forces in the occupied 
areas "are expected to provide the 
nucleus of resistance in the Jap- 
anese rear when plans are corn- 
Dieted for the liberation of the N. 
E. I. " according to government 
sources, 

^pnn srable 

NEW YORK — "I can foresee no 
way in which the Japanese can pre- 
vent landings on their home is- 
lands," Maj. Gen. Claire L. Chen- 
nault, commander of the 14th 
United States Army air force, de- 
clared this week. He added, "I think 
I can say that we enjoy air super- 
iority over all occupied China. The 
Japanese are now attempting^ to 
dig in for a last stand in China, 
Manchuria and Korea as well as on 
their own islands." 



New Commonwealth Defense Secretary 
Fought Japs for 3 Years as Guerrilla 



"We shall benefit from the les- 
sons of the past in our defense 
plans," Tomas Cabili, newly-ap- 
pointed secretary of national de- 
fense, declared in an interview yes- 
terday . 

Cabili took his oath of office be- 
fore President Sergio Osmena on 
March 9, after he arrived in Ma- 
nila by plane from Mindanao. 
Cabili's appointment is considered 
in government circles a recogni- 
tion of the part played by guerril- 
las in the liberation of the Phil- 
ippines. The new department 
head is also the first Moro to be- 
come a member of the cabinet. 

At the outbreak of the war, Ca- 



bili was in Manila. <r When I 
heard that Pearl Harbor had been 
bombed," he related, "I immediate- 
ly tried to board a boat for my 
home province." 

Cabili was able to secure a tic- 
ket on board the SS. Corregidor, 
which was sunk by a mine in Ma- 
nila Bay. However, he did not 
take the boat. At the last minute 
he decided to go to Mindanao via 
southern Luzon, Masbate, Leyte 
and Surigao. 

"I took the last traiu to Albay," 
said Cabili, "and in Albay I was 
captured by the Japs. After dis- 
arming me, they released me when 



Matrimony Takes 
Holiday in Manila 



Believe it or not, in this city 
where everybody believes it's fun 
to get married, not one marriage 
license has been issued since the 
American forces arrived over a 
month ago. Not one marriage has 
been performed, and not one ap- 
plication for a marriage license 
has been filed in more than a 
month. 

Judge Guillermo Cabrera, of the 
Manila Municipal Court, thinks 
the lack of interest in marriages 
may be due to the fact that nearly 
everybody is busily looking for a 
job and making a fresh start in 
life. He believes that, later, when 
more people have made sure where 
their bread and butter is coming 
from, they may get around to the 
matter of marriage. 

This does not mean, of course, 
that Dan Cupid has been twiddling 
his thumbs all the while. The 
truth seems to be that, in times 
of stress such as these, people are 
apt to overlook, temporarily, the 
moral side of most problems. 
Solely for the benefit of "children 
of sin," a Catholic priest of Ton- 
do has signified his willingness to 
perform the marriage service free 
of charge during the coming Holy 
Week, at his parish church.

Filipino Screen, 
Stage Stars Give 
Shows for Troops 



Anxious to do their bit for the 
Yanks, Filipino stage and . screen 
stars in Manila have formed vau- 
deville* troupes to tour the nearby 
provincial towns, to entertain the 
fighting forces of Uncle Sam. 

One such troupe now touring 
Bulacan province is headed by 
veteran songster Katy de la Cruz, 
and includes such stage luminaries 
as Baby Jane, Nieves and the Fi- 
lipino version of Laurel and Har- 
dy. American doughboys who 
saw the troupe in action in Plari- 
del and Meycawayan, Bulacan, 
said the troupe was as good as, if 
not better than, similar vaudeville 
teams touring cities of the United 
States. 

Other movie personalities are 
busy in the field chasing Japs. 
The Padilla brothers, Carlos and 
Jose, are in the hills of Bulacan 
settling a score with Yamashita's 
fleeing legions. Three years ago 
Carlos saw his sister die at the 
hands of a Japanese machinegun- 
ner. 

Corazon Noble, beautiful screen 
actress, is in the emergency hos- 
pital at the Jefferson elementary 
school near Calle Espana, nursing 
a grave bayonet wound inflicted 
by a Japanese marine. Tita Du- 
ran is also in the same hospital. 
Rosario Moreno, another popular 
movie artist, was killed last Feb 
8, by a Japanese shell.

BERG — Troopt of ths Third 



Health Dept. Finds City 
Entirely Free of Cholera 



Colonel Maurice C. Pincoffs, 
M.C., director of the city health de- 
partment, yesterday scouted ru- 
mors of the existence of cholera 
in Manila. 

"These are unfounded," he said. 
"Severe diarrhea cases have been 
carefully investigated, but none of 
them have proved to be cholera." 

The health director stated that 
diarrhea and other relatively mild 
enteric diseases being still preva- 
lent, it is urgent that the public 
cooperate in the cleaning up of the 
city, and continue boiling all we- 

ff"" 4tJ^Ww«j nmA fu t m m ii w w- 



I said I was a Moro plantation 
owner." 

In Dansalan, Cabili organized a 
"Bolo Battalion." Later he was 
transferred to Malaybalay, where 
he acted as traffic policeman, con- 
voy officer and finally executive 
officer of the 101st division. 

When the order for the surren- 
der of the USAFFE was given by 
General Wainwright, Cabili re- 
fused to give himself up. He fled 
to the mountains of Valencia. 

Once he was almost caught, but 
he was able to escape by hiding 
in some bushes. 

"On September 10, 1942, we or- 
ganized a guerrilla* group," Cabili 
said. "General Pindatan of the 
guerrillas arrived with his men 
and, with the cooperation of As- 
semblyman Fortich, we organized 
a real fighting unit. The chief 
of staff of the outfit was Col. Ed- 
win Andrews, who had also re- 
fused to surrender. I was G-l. 
G-2, G-3 and G-4. 

"On several occasions we at- 
tacked the Japanese in Malayba- 
lay. With only 180 armed men, 
we drove the Japanese out of 
Camp Casisang," the defense sec- 
retary continued. 

"For six months, our guerrilla 
group under Andrews, Pindatan 
and myself held a line around Ma- 
laybalay against any attacking 
Japanese force. We harassed 
their communications and often 
denied to them use of the main 
highways by ambushing their 
trucks. 

"By coincidence, on March 7, 
my birthday, we were scattered 
and disorganized. Andrews and I 
were sent to the camp of Col. Fer- 
tig. 

"In the beginning," the secre- 
tary went on, "we did not recognize 
Fertig because we believed he was 
not recognized by the proper au- 
thorities. But later when we got 
the assurance that he was a 'gen- 
uine guerrilla,' we reported to him 
for orders." 

Under Col. Fertig, Cabili organ- 
ized combat mobile units. "We 
had eight combat mobile units, and 
I was G-2 and G-3 of those unite," 
said Cabili. 

On March 10, 1944, Cabili was 
promoted to lieutenant colonel. 
Then he organized volunteers to 
construct an air-strip in the heart 
of the mountains of Mindanao. 

"One day, I received a message 
from Fertig telling me to report 
to Manila because President Os- 
mena was looking for me," Cabili 
said. "I was flown to Manila. 

"When the President told me 
he wanted to make me his secre- 
tary of national defense," Cabili 
said, "I told him I did not think 
I could fill the social demands of 
the position. But the President 
said he wanted to give recognition 
to the fight of the guerrilleros, 
and to have a man from Mindanao 
in his cabinet." 

Cabili was recently promoted to 
the rank of colonel. Asked to 
outline the policies of his depart- 
ment, Cabili said, '"We are now 
making the preliminary plana. 
But the main policies regarding

JAP LINES BROKEN EAST OF MANILA 



5 U.S. Armies Drive on Rhine 



Offensive Ss 
Stepped Up on 
200 Mile Front 



PARIS — Five American armies 
launched a general offensive 
Thursday along the entire south- 
ern half of the western front, 
aimed at erasing German oppo- 
sition west of the Rhine, front 
line dispatches indicated today. 

The offensive extended along a 
200-mile sector from Duisberg in 
the north to Karlsruhe at the 
corner of Alsace. At the lower 
end of the front, the Third and 
Seventh Armies joined forces to 
smash into the northern and 
southern corners of the Saar 
Basin. The Seventh sw^ng along 
a 50-mile front, marking up gains 
of three miles against light op- 
position, and capturing one of 
the largest steel mills in the Saar. 
Third Army tanks and infantry 
dashed into the rear of the Sieg- 
fried Line and crossed the Moselle 
River southwest of Coblenz. 

East of the Rhine, First Army 
elements seized four more towns 
at the edge of their expanding 
Remagen bridgehead and advan- 
ced within a half-mile of the six- 
lane speedway leading to Frank- 
fort on Main. 

American and British bombers 
tarried out some of the heaviest 
Attacks of the war Thursday, top- 
ped by a 2,000-plane raid on Nazi 
supreme headquarters just south 
of Berlin. RAF heavies dropped 
new 11-ton "volcano" bombs on 
rail bridges at the eastern end of 
the Ruhr. 

U. S. Flying Fortresses from 
Italy flew 1,400 miles roundtrip 
to batter the gigantic Ruhland oil 
refinery 65 miles southeast of 
Berlin, described as "the most 
l&ipost-tint targe*; in Eurcpo." 



Poison Liquor 
Kills Seven U.S. 
Soldiers Here 

Poison liquor killed seven 
American soldiers and sent several 
more to hospitals in the 24-hour 
period up to noon Friday, Colonel 
M. E. Jones, Manila police chief, 
revealed last night. 

Five Chinese and one Filipino 
were arrested, over 700 gallons 
of liquor confiscated and four 
thousand counterfeit labels and 
seals seized. 

One still, seized within three 
blocks of Bilibid prison, was oper- 
ating under the most unsanitary 
conditions imaginable, Colonel 
Jones said. The liquor was being 
manufactured from sugar and 
wood alcohol in a stable shared 
by horses, carabao and oxen. 

The Manila police department 
is cracking down on every kind 
of law violation. "We're not go- 
ing to have lawlessness," Colonel 
Jones said. "We're going to clean 
the city up if it's the last thing 
we do. Manila is going to be a 
decent place in which decent per- 
sons can live." 



Big Osaka Arsenal 
Blown Up By B-29's 

GUAM — Osaka's 150-acre arse- 
nal — the largest in Japan — went 
up in explosion after explosion in 
Wednesday's attack by 300 Super 
Fortresses, Gen. Curtis LeMay re- 
ported Thursday. 

The commander of B-29 opera-

Marines' Iwo 
Campaign Is 
Virtually Over 



IWO JIMA— The costly 24-day 
campaign for Iwo Jima ended of- 
ficially Thursday as victorious 
American Marine forces raised the 
Stars and Stripes over the 8- 
square-mile knob of land 750 miles 
southeast of Tokyo. 

A proclamation naming Admiral 
Chester W. Nimitz military gover- 
nor of Iwo was read, while Japa- 
nese resistance continued from two 
isolated pockets still remaining at 
the northern and northeastern cor- 
ners. 

Careful but incomplete estimates 
placed the number of Japanese 
dead sacrificed in the futile de- 
fense of Iwo at 20,000, yesterday's 
Pacific fleet communique said. 
American dead in the same period 
numbered about 4,000 — less than 
one-fifth the Japanese total. 

Lt. Gen. Holland M. Smith, Ma- 
rine commander in the Pacific, de- 
clared the "major fighting is fin- 
ished" although the job of elimi- 
nating the remaining two pockets 
of Japanese may require several 
weeks. 

"It has been difficult," he said, 
"and we suffered considerable loss- 
es on the ground, in the air, and 
on the sea, as must always be the 
case where the only practical me- 
thod is frontal assault." 

Possession of Iwo with its three 
airfields, unlocks Japan's inner-de- 
fense line from the south, and per- 
mits American planes to base with- 
in fighter range of Tokyo.

Main Enemy 
Road South 
on Luzon Cut 



American troops have broken 
the enemy line east of Manila, des- 
troying the entire southern flank 
of the elaborate Antipolo-Wawa 
line, General MacArthur's com- 
munique announced this morning. 
Simultaneously, other XI Corp 
units cut the main Japanese com- 
munication line to south Luzon at 
Maybancal. 

Great losses were inflicted on 
the Jap defenders of the Mariki- 
na watershed area in the three 
weeks' campaign that cracked the 
heavily fortified area. American 
losses were light. 

The 43rd Division reached a 
point four miles east of Antipolo, 
while other troops attacking north- 
west from Morong peninsula seized 
high around Teresa. 

The 11th Airborne division, push- 
ing east on Luzon into Batangaa 
province from the Lake Taal re- 
gion, reached Santo Tomas and 
Tanauan. The 158th regiment, 
clearing the shores of Batangas 
bay, destroyed a concentration of 
enemy barges and dispersed Japa- 
nese elements trying to land at 
Bolo, 

The 6th and 43rd divisions were 
approaching Teresa in the Mariki- 
na watershed, east of Manila. 

Heavy bombers again hit Minda- 
nao, the Sulu archipelago and For- 
mosa, dropping more than 376 tons 
of bombs on supply and camp 
areas, a hydro-electric plant and a 
fuel storage depot. 

Air patrols on the South China 
sea blockade sank a Jap destroyer, 
a 6,000-ton tanker and four small 
freighters. 

Australian ground forcee, in an 
amphibious operation, landed on 
the northwest coast of Bougainville 
opposite Saposa island, pushing in- 
land without reported opposition.

Major Clarence Woodhouse, relief 
and supply officer, who ordered 
several enlisted men to confiscate 
all the PCAU goods involved-

PCAU No. 20 Serving One 
Of City's Largest Areas 



The floating supply force car- 
ries as many supplies as was used 
by the entire U. S. Navy in nine 
months before the war. 

"The supplies necessary for 
this naval and amphibious force 
are astronomical,' ' Johnson con- 
cluded. "For example: It con- 
sumes enough fuel to make a 
train of tank cars, each with 
10,000-gallon capacity, 238 miles 
long, with enough left over to 
heat 10,000 homes for a full year. 
It burns up enough gasoline to 
operate 30,700 automobiles for a 
year, or enough to run one car 
300,000,000 miles." 



laps Reported Slaying 
Their Makapili Allies 



SOMEWHERE IN THE WEST- 
ERN PACIFIC— "When you learn 
that the navy floating supply base 
for a task force carries enough 
candy, cigarettes and toilet art- 
icles to supply 6,000 drugstores, 
when you realize such supplies 
form an almost legitimate part of 
such a task force, you get a fairly 
good impression of what it takes 
to service the greatest concentra- 
tion of fighting ships in naval his- 
tory," Malcolm Johnson of the 
Chicago Sun stated recently in 
describing a United States naval 
supply base. He added: 

"I am speaking of the Fifth 
Fleet which conducted a daring 
dramatic strike againrt the Japa- 
nese homeland and covering ope- 
rations for the landing of U. S. 
Marines at Iwo Jim&. This is the 
story of the world's greatest float- 
ing base, the story of Squadron 
10, Service Force, Pacific Area, 
which provides not only a supply 
but repair base. 

"These ships carry 38,000 tons 
of spare clothing, enough to clothe 
1,500,000 persons completely. 
They carry 3,000 tons of tooth 
powder, candy, ice cream and 
razor blades. 

"The overall figures are tre- 
mendous. Every item of supply 
which ordinarily goes into a city 
like New York must be put aboard 
a task force before it can sail. 
Squadron 10 has to maintain 
16,000 different supply items, 
Two typical items are 270,000 
pounds of soap, and 5,000,000 
packs of cigarettes. Squadron 10 
also handles thousands of tons of 
mail and movies. 

"The thousands of tons of sup 
plies, ammunition and fuel which 
went into this one operation 
against the Japs had to be brought 
from home ports both east and 
west. The floating supply base is 
as far from San Francisco as San 
Francisco is from London, as far 
from Pearl Harbor as San Fran- 
cisco is from New York. 

"The exact number of ships I DETROIT — The 8,000th four-en-

PCAU No. 20, which serves the 
North Central Manila area, count- 
ed over 200,000 people on its re- 
lief rolls last week. However, this 
figure is declining as more re- 
tail stations are established. 

Some 70 retail stores are in ope- 
ration in the 16 different sections 
within PCAU No. 20's zone. Sev- 
enteen refugee homes in the area, 
housing approximately 9,000 peo- 
ple, have been maintaining their 
own kitchens. Welfare workers 
and nurses in the zone manage an 
orphanage. 

Kindergarten classes are al- 
ready open and primary and ele- 
mentary classes are expected to 
start soon. 

PCAU 20 is running six hospi- 
tals and 15 dispensaries. They 
have treated a total of 37,000 
walking patients. 



Red Cross Supplies 

For U. S. War Prisoners 



The Japanese in southern Luzon 
have started butchering their Ma- 
kapili and Kapariz allies, accord- 
ing to reports reaching Manila, 
through guerrilla channels. Appa- 
rently these Filipinos have out- 
lived their usefulness to their Jap- 
anese masters. 

The Makapili — Makabayang Ka- 
tipunan ng Pilipino — was created 
and led by Gen. Artemio Ricarte, 
the organization's chief adviser; 
Benigno Ramos, president; and 
Pio Duran, vice-president. Most 
of the Makapilis are to be found 
in Laguna, Rizal and portions of 
Cavite. 

The Kapariz — Kabata-ang Pa- 
ngarap ni Rizal — was the brain 
child of the Jap-sponsored Kali- 
bani. Like the Makapili, the Ka 
pariz thrived in the Sakdal-in- 
fested provinces of Rizal, Laguna 
and parts of Cavite and Bulacan. 

When the Japanese were solid- 
ifying their defenses on Luzon, 
they used the Makapilis and the 
Kapariz in procuring foodstuffs 
for the Nipponese armed services. 
They were also used to transport 
foodstuffs to the Japs' mountain 
strongholds. 




CHUNGKING — Chinese forces

ground forces captured several 
suburbs of Ichang and cleared re-

MELBOURNE ~ Japan hat* 
"agreed in principle" to clear ■ 
through Vladivostok a second ship-

Thursday. 

The broadcast also said that Ja- 
pan agreed to permit International 
Red Cross delegates or agents to 
visit prison camps at Singapore. 
Heretofore, Red Cross agents have 
been allowed to visit only camps 
in Japan proper and Korea. 

The Australian radio said the 
Red Cross is sending a larger vol- 
ume of relief supplies to Vladi- 
vostok than was sent last year in 
the hope of persuading the Jap- 
anese to send a larger ship than 
the Hakusan Maru which went to 
the port of Nakhodka. 

Tokyo said a cargo of supplies

Manila Harbor Salvage Job One 
Of Biggest of World War II 



FILIPINOS WELCOME AMERICAN LIBERATORS — Joyous 
Filipinos rush alona a newlv-won beach to welcome TJ. S. forces. La- 
test American landings were madd on Romblon and Siriwrm east of 



The clearing 0 of Manila harbor 
presents one of the biggest indivi- 
dual salvage jobs of the war, Com- 
modore William A. Sullivan, Navy 
salvage officer in charge of opera- 
tions, told newsmen in Manila Wed- 
nesday. The job is three times 
bigger than any salvage work un- 
dertaken in European harbors, 
both in the tonnage to be handled 
and the number of sunken vessels 
to be removed, with the possible 
exception of Marseilles harbor. 

The 60-year-old human dynamo 
who began salvage operations on 
the Normandie comes to Manila 
from the biggest European opera- 
tions, including the clearing of 
Naples, Cherbourg and the channel 
ports. 

Commodore Sullivan estimated 
there are at least 300 sunken ves- 
sels to be raised from Manila Bay, 
some of them piled three high as 
they were sunk one on top of ano- 
ther. Most of the sunken ships 
are Japanese. Twenty-five to 
thirty were scuttled by the Jap- 
anese, the others went to the bot- 
tom as a result of American bomb- 
ing and aerial torpedo attacks. 
One hundred and two have actual- 
ly been spotted by surface survey, 
approximately 100 more by air, 
and at least 100 more are known 
to be on the bottom of the harbor, 
down too deep to be seen from the 
surface. 

Experience gained in salvage 
work on the Normandie has given 
the Navy invaluable information, 
Commodore Sullivan said. The 
lessons learned in that operation 
have been used to create a salvage 
school for naval personnel. 

WVn'lp fho snrvev i q 71 vet com- 
plete, rapid progress is being made 
-yp clearing % channel int/> Manila 



Bay. The Pasig river has been 
cleared for tug and barge traffic 
as far as Jones bridge, Pier 7 is 
being reconstructed by Army engi- 
neers, and as soon as the harbor 
breakwater has been cleared some 
parts of the bay will be open to 
shipping. Above Jones bridge, 
three small J&p cargo vessels 
block the channel. When one of 
them is floated out, the river will 
be reopened for a considerable dis- 
tance. 

Fifty Jap vessels of varying 
sizes are known to be at the bottom 
of the Pasig. A 3,000 to 4,000-ton 
Jap freighter is sunk on the north 
side of Pier 7, with three "sugar 
charlies" stacked on top of it. 
Commodore Sullivan explained 
that "sugar charlies" are small 
Jap luggers of 250 to 300 tons used 
in harbor transport. 

Along the south side of Pier 7 
lies a Jap cargo vessel of at least 
10,000 tons, sunk by American 
aerial torpedos. The vessel, badly 
broken up, presents a major sal- 
vage job. 

Five or six Japanese vessels 
were scuttled between breakwaters 
at the harbor entrance. Commo- 
dore Sullivan believes that raising 
one vessel will clear the entrance 
sufficiently to allow the passage 
of American cargo vessels. This 
work, he says, should be accom- 
plished in a few days. 

Twenty-one Jan vessels, chained 
together, which were scuttled at 
the southern end of the break- 
water by the Yacht Club basin, 
must also be removed.

nila harbor since the Americans

Rebuilding of 
City Commercial 
Area Pioceeding 



The commercial district of Ma- 
nila has been buzzing with activity 
in the last few days as private in- 
dividuals plunge into the job of 
reconstructing and repairing 
buildings not completely damaged 
by the bombing and shelling* 

In several places the debris has 
been cleared and the blows of ham- 
mers have been putting into some 
semblance of order what once 
used to be beautiful stores and 
restaurants. 

Reconstruction activity has been 
induced by the growing demand 
for eating and drinking spots by 
soldiers who visit the city gn short 
leaver. 

In the commercial section of Hi- 
zal Avenue, from Azcarraga to 
Plaza Goiti, four restaurants have 
opened for business. Many more 
floor spaces are being transform- 
ed into bars and restaurants. 

On the Eacolta, the proprietor of 
a jewelry store has begun clearing 
a place where he expects to put 
up his old business. Since there 
is little left of his goods, he 
vrill" specialize in jewelry repair. 

On Dasmarinas Street, two 
floor spaces are under repair, one 
to be used by the Cosmos Club as 
a restaurant and the other to 
house a local batik when permits 
to reopen are granted, 

WASHINGTON — A quota of

The United States Veterans 
Administration has reopened its 
Philippine office in the Trade and 
Commerce building, according to 
Col. J. C. Palmer. 

The office is now prepared to 
render assistance to former pen- 
sioners and to would-be pension- 
ers, Col Palmer said yesterday. 

It is a statutory requirement that 
all former pensioners file applica- 
tions for the restoration of pen- 
sions, in the same manner as new 
claims are made. The forms for 
this purpose may be obtained at 
the now office. 

The pension benefits ate based 
on military and naval service of 
veterans of the Spanish- American 
War, Philippine Insurrection, and 
World War L The majority of 
the 7,000 former pensioners here 
were members of the Philippine 
Scouts who served during the war 
of 1901 and 1902, and their depen- 
dents. It is anticipated that most 
of the future claims will be based 
on service during World War II, 

Rates of pension for former vet- 
erans vary according to degree 
of disability, whether service was 
rendered during war or peace- 
time, and in some cases according 
to age. Generally pensions for vet- 
erans of the Spanish- American 
War and Philippine Insurrection 
range from $20 to $75 per month, 
based on disabilities not connected 
with the service, while pensions 
for diseases or injuries in service 
during Worra War I or World 
War II range from $11.50 to $115 
per

As part of an Eleventh Airborne 
division assault force which in- 
vaded Saipang island recently, 
Sgt. Melvin Miller accomplished 
a feat unique in the history of 
amphibious warfare. 

He hit the beachhead at such 
high speed that he skidded across 
the island and into the water on 
the far side, 

Saipang is at the mouth of the 
Maragondon river, which spills 
into Manila bay in southern Ca- 
vite province. It is a half-mile 
long and, in places, only ten yards 
wide. The shore is flanked by 
tangled underbrush. 

The landing was unopposed. 
"We didn't fire a shot," Miller re- 
ported, "because there wasn't any- 
thing to fire at We came, we 
saw, we conquered. We left. It 
was the most peaceful landing in 
the Pacific"

A number of Filipino guerrilla: 
who came down from the hill

Costly Battle 
For Ivi't- jsiaod 



Kobe Fourth Jap, City To 
Get B-29 Fire Treatment 



GUAM— The U.S. Navy an- 
nounced Saturday that the battle 
for Iwo Jima, 8-square-mile Japa- 
nese fortress in, the Volcano islands 
750 miles from Tokyo, "has been 
won." 

Admiral Chester Niniitz, Pacific 
fleet commander, said that the 27- 
day battle was the costliest inva- 
sion in the Pacific war, and de- 
clared that the Marines had gone 
ashore on Iwo February 19 "with 
certain knowledge of the cost of an 
objective which had to be taken." 

In wiping out the Japanese gar- 
rison of between 20,000 and 25,000 
men, the three Marine divisions suf- 
fered 19,938 casualties: 4,189 dead, 
15,308 wounded and 441 missing. 
A "very considerable number" of 
the wounded already have returned 
to duty. 

Organized resistance on Iwo 
eeased at 6 p.m. Saturday when the 
Americana broke through enemy 
lines at the northern tip of the is- 
land. 

Dividends already were accruing 
to the U.S. forces. So far, 80 
B-29's haye landed op Iwo's air- 
strips. The planes, out of fuel or 
damaged, would have been forced | 
to make crash landings at sea, and 
perhaps lost their crews, had Iwo 
been unavailable to them. 

Tokyo radio did not admit the 
loss of one of Japan's most vital 
defense posts, but stated Saturday 
that "it is clear, following the Iwo 
campaign, the enemy will advance 
into a new area of operations." 

Carrying of Arms 
Banned In City 

No on© nay carry arms in the 
city of Manila after Tuesday, 
March 20th, Colonel M. E. Jones, 
Manila police chief, revealed to- 
day. The rule applies to civilians 
and soldiers alike, with the ex- 
ception of police department 
members and a few specially auth- 
orized persons working through 
the provost marshall's office. 

The ban on carrying weapons 
inside the city comes as a part 
of the widespread cleanup cam- 
paign being conducted by the 
police department to clear the 
city of lawless elements. 

Colonel Jones cited a number 
of recent instances in which in- 
discriminate firing of weapons 
had endangered the lives of Ma- 
nila residents. An MP lieuten- 
ant was shot between the eyes 
in the Pa3ay district Thursday, 
and numerous other districts of 
the city have reported wild shoot- 
ing by Ar^vikm arsA disorderly 



GUAM— Kobe became the fourth 
great Japanese city to receive a 
fire baptism at the hands of Amer- 
ican B-29 bombardiers when more 
than 300 of the superbombers 
struck the huge transportation 
center at four o'clock Saturday 
morning. Pilots returning from 
the raid reported seeing huge fires 
which were visible 100 miles out 
to sea. 

Direct hits were scored on the 
big Mitsubishi aircraft plant and 
the Kawasake locomotive works, 
as well as the dock areas. More 
than 2,500 tons of incendiaries 
were dropped in a five-square-mile 
area by the Marianas-based bom- 
bers. The planes came in at low 
altitude, meeting light antiaircraft 
fire and no fighter opposition. 

Kobe's was the fourth all-out fire 
attack on Japan in a week, and the 
tonnage of bombs dropped ex- 
ceeded the loads poured into Tok- 



yo, Nagoya and Osaka — which 
destroyed 24 square miles of those 
cities. The first great fire attack, 
made on March 10, was the most 
successful, destroying 17 square 
miles of the industrial heart of 
Tokyo. The same treatment was 
applied on Monday to Nagoya, 
where two square miles were 
burned out. Wednesday it was 
Osaka, and approximately five 
square miles were left in ruins. 
About 16,000,000 persons dwell in 
the four cities which havs been 
first to feel the full power of the 
Superfortresses. 

Kobe is Japan's fifth largest 
city, situated on Osaka bay 20 
miles east of the city of Osaka. 
Kobe has thousands of factories, 
and is Japan's principal seaport. 
It had previously been attacked by 
a smaller force of B-29's on Feb- 
ruary 24. i 



Americans Enter Coblenz, 
Extend Rhine Bridgehead 



PARIS — Troops of Gen. Patton's 
American Third army drove into 
Coblenz Saturday by an amphi- 
bious assault across the Moselle 
river, from the south. By night- 
fall they had cleared two thirds of 
the city. 

Coblenz is one of the greatest 
prizes taken on the western front 
because its position at the con- 
fluence of the Rhine and Moselle 
rivers gives its command of vital 
river, rail and highway routes. Its 
pre-war population was 58,000. 
Coblenz was strongly fortified, 
and much of the city is now in 
ruins because of air and artillery 
attacks 

The U. S. First army on Satur- 
day extended its Remagen bridge- 
head across the Rhine to 13 miles 
long and seven miles deep, and 
captured a two-mile stretch of the 
super-highway which runs north- 
ward into Germany's vital Ruhr 
industrial basin. 

American Seventh army forces 
were reported attacking on a 50- 
mile front in the southern Saar 
valley, and had taken the last 
Nazi-held fortress in the old 
French Maginot line at Bitche. 
The Seventh and Third are on the 
offensive near Saarbucken, driving 
to liquidate the last two German 
field armies west of the Rhine. 

It was revealed that U. S. Ninth 
army troops have made a number 
of patrol penetrations across the 
I Rhine north of the First army s 



Russians Closing 
On Berlin's Seaport 



MOSCOW — Marshal Zhukov's 
armies are narrowing the Nazi 
bridgehead east of the Oder river 
mouth southeast of the prize Baltic 
port of Stettin, capital of Ger- 
many's province of Pomerania, 
which serves Berlin both as its sea- 
port and anchor of the German ca- 
pital's last eastern defense line. 

Saturday's Russian communique 
said that Zhukov's troops have cap- 
tured Frauenhof, 4% miles south 
of Stettin. Two thousand German 
prisoners were taken. 

In East Prussia, the Russians 
captured the key Nazi stronghold 
of Brandenburg, nine miles south- 
west of Koenigsberg, the provincial 
capital . 

Moscow Radio reported that the 
Red Army had killed more than 
20,000 Germans and destroyed over 
GOO tanks in repulsing German 
counter-attacks in a 13-day battle 
near Lake Balaton, southwest of 
the conquered Hungarian capital of 
Budapest.

MacArthur's 
Forces Land 
On Basilan I. 



Japanese casualties on Luzon 
are estimated at more than eight 
to one, General MacArthur'i 
headquarters announced Sunday. 
Enemy casualties in the first nine 
weeks of the Luzon campaign were 
placed at more than 145,000. 

MacArthur's communique also 
announced new American landings 
on Basilan island, off the south- 
western tip of Mindanao. Control 
of the strategic island in the Sulu 
archipelago will provide strong pro- 
tection for the southern water ap- 
proaches to Zamboanga, where 
Eighth Army troops are steadily 
enlarging their beachhead. 

Fourteenth Corps units, fighting 
south of Manila, captured Mabini 
and Mt. Muntingtubig on the Ca- 
lumpan peninsula between Batan- 
gas and Balayan bays. The 43rd 
division occupied Teresa in the 
Marikina watershed, and pushed 
patrols to the northeast. 

American casualties on Luzon 
total 18,579, according to the es- 
timates of MacArthur's staff. 
The losses were broken down as 
follows: 8,813 killed, 196 missing, 
and 14,570 wounded. To the es- 
timated 145,000 of Yamashita's 
men killed on Luzon, the commu- 
nique adds 137,000 enemy casual- 
ties in the Visayas, bringing the 
total Japanese loss in five months 
of futile effort to hold tht Phil- 
ippines to 282,000. 



Suspend Payment of 
Debts Incurred During 
Japanese Occupation 



Temporary suspension of the 
payment of debts and other mone- 
tary obligations is provided for in 
executive order No. 32, by Presi- 
dent Sergio Osmena, according tc 
the department of information. 

The order reads: "Enforcement 
of payment of all debts and other 
monetary obligations payable with- 
in the Philippines, except debts 
and other monetary obligations en- 
tered into in any area after dec- 
laration by Presidential proclama- 
tion that such area has been freed 
from enemy occupation and con- 
trol, is temporarily suspended

14 Daily, Weekly Newspapers 
Being Published in Manila 



The disscininatioti of newa is be- 
ing carried out in Manila by pri- 
vate enterprise despite great diffi- 
culties r 

With the majority of pre-war 
newspapers still out of circulation, 
many new periodicals have sprung 
up to meet the big demand for news 
that does not smack of Jap pro- 
paganda. According to a survey 
made yesterday, there are at pres- 
ent 14 newspapers publishing in 
the city, and of this number twelve 
are new in the field. 

Newspaper publishers and edit- 
ors said they are doing their best 
to carry on in the interest of pub- 
lic service although "there is no 
money in the business." They claim 
that the cost of producing the small 
two-page newspaper is very high 
at present because of the shortage 
of newsprint and printing mater- 
la Is. 

Practically all the newspapers 
now in circulation are being turned 
out by small hand-powered presses 
using hand-set type, the duplex 
presses and linotypes of pre-war 
days having disappeared. In view 
of this , it was pointed out, the out- 
put is somewhat limited. 

The survey shows that there, are 
as many Chinese as Filipino news- 
papers. Of the Chinese publica- 
tions, two published before the war. 
These are the Foo-kien Times and 
Kung Li Po News, the latter being 
a Kuomintang party organ. The 
new Chinese papers are the Chi- 
nese Guide, Manila New Day, 
Chinese Commercial Bulletin, the 
Vanguard and the Fuse. 

One of the Filipino publications, 
the Liberator, is a guerrilla paper 
brought into the open after Amer- 
ican forces arrived. The others be- 
gan publishing after February 3, 

In addition to the Liberator, the 
Manila Post and Victory News are 
printed in English.* Bagong Buhay 
and Tagumjv&y are in Tagaio^;; 
Vox de Manila and La Victoria in 
Spanish ♦ 

Among the popular pre-war 
newspapers which have not yet re- 
sumed publication are the Manila 
Daily Bulletin, the Philippines Free 
Press, the DMHM Publications and 
the Chinese Commercial News. The 
Manila Daily Bulletin was recently 
awarded a quota of newsprint by 
the War Production Board in 
Washington. 

Roy C, Bennett, editor of the 
Manila Bulletin, sak that the pa- 
per will resume puMvation as soon 
as the facilities to* printing per- 
mit. 

The Chinese Commercial News, 
one of the driest Chinese newspa- 
pers in the country, expects to re- 
sume in about two weeks, The 
former publisher, Yu Ti Tong, has 
b'ien lisping since he wag taken by

Gains Jn Islands 

MELBOURNE— Australian for- 
ces on the New Guinea coast have 
advanced 4,000 yards from Simba 
creek to capture Kauk mis&ion, 
the Australian radio reported 
Thursday, 

On Bougainville island in the 
Solomons, an Australian unit 
moved by barge to an advance 
position on the weet coast, and 
drove inland toward Sarakan 
plantation where the Japanese 
are entrenched. On New Britain 
Australian forces opened a mor- 
tar and artillery barrage on plan* 
tation positions hdld by the Ja- 
panese, **in preparation for a final

Romulo Arrives 
In United States 



SAN FRANCISCO— Brig. Gen. 
Carlos P. Komulo, Philippine resid- 
ent commissioner to the United 
States, left Thursday for Washing- 
ton to take up his duties on behalf 
of the Commonwealth government. 
He arrived from the Philippines on 
Wednesday, 

Romulo said he had hurried back 
to the United States to tell the 
story of the destruction of Manila, 
so that the American people would 
know the nature of Japanese mili- 
tarism* 

''Nanking was the primeval in- 
stinct of the Japanese asserting it- 
self/' he stated, "but Manila was 
studied and systematic. This Was 
all on orders from Tokyo, We have 
captured documents to prove it. I 
am going to read them on the floor 
of Congress as soon as possible."

How the Mactan made the trip 
to Australia wai beyond the com- 
prehension of most seamen who

Allies Take 140,000 
Nazis la 3 Weeks 



WASHINGTON — About 140,000 
prisoners have been taken by the 
Allied armies, since February 23, 
when the current western front 
offensive began, Secretary of 
War Stimson announced Thuri- 
day. 

He said that the war on the 
western front has reached "a 
very critical stage." 

A* an example of the progress 
of fighting along the Rhine river, 
the secretary said he had received 
& report on the capture by a single 
American army corps of the fol- 
lowing material: 68 tanks, 166 
88-millimeter guns, 23 self-propel- 
led guns, 41 anti-tank guns, 51 
mortars and a large number of 
smaller weapons^ 

"The desperate situation of the 
Germans is indicated by German 
army orders to shoot all strag- 
glers," Stimson said. "Last De-

. The new secretary of the inte- 
rior , Tomas Confesor, thrives on 
trouble. He was born in Cabatuan, 
Iloilo, March 2, 1891, and his fa- 
ther a few years afterward was 
hanged by the Americans for rev- 
olutionary activities during the 
Filipino-American conflict. Some 
40 years later, Confesor led the 
resistance movement in Panay in 
the joint Filipino-American strug- 
gle against the Japanese. 

When his mother died soon after 
his father's death, Confesor knew 
poverty. He lived on bananas and 
camotes while he went through 
school. On graduating from high 
school with honors, he worked as 
a clerk in the office of the public 
veterinarian for f20 a month, then 
worked hii way to the United 
States where he scrubbed floors, 
washed dishes and dusted window 
panes. ; In 1915 he returned to the 
Philippines a university graduate. 
He taught in Iloilo, married Rosa- 
lina Grecia and had a child, To- 
mas, Jr. 

Offered the assistant professor- 
ship in economics at the University 
of the Philippines, Confesor taught 
there until 1922, then ran for re- 
presentative of the 3rd district 
and was reelected for three suc- 
cessive terms. Described by his col- 
leagues as "stormy" in character, 
he fought Manuel Roxas' leader- 
ship in the house. In 1928 he pre- 
sented himself as an independent 
candidate against the official can- 
didates of the Democrata and the 
Nacionalista parties, and won 
again. 

Later, Confesor was appointed to 
the directorship of the bureau of 
commerce. He resigned to run for 
his old post in the house during 
the "Pro-and-Anti" controversy, 
and lost. Soon after this set-back, 
his district elected him to represent 
it in the Constitutional Assembly. 

When the members of the Na- 
tional Assembly were being chosen 
under the Independence Act, Con- 



"P. I. Conditions Changed 
Greatly/' Laurel Avers 



A Domei interview with Jose P. 
Laurel, who headed the Japanese 
puppet government of the Philip- 
pines, was reported by the Japa- 
nese radio March 14. Laurel's 
whereabouts since the American 
landing on Luzon have been a mys- 
tery. 

Domei said Laurel was inter- 
viewed in a house which had been 
riddled by bullets and recently was 
narrowly missed by American 
bombs. 

"Conditions in the Philippines 
have changed greatly," he was 
quoted as saying. "Our political ac- 
tivities have been restricted. Var- 
ious difficulties and obstacles have 
arisen. However, these are to be 
expected during wartime. As pres- 
ident of the Philippines, I am de- 
termined I shall never falter over 
such trivial matters." 

Laurel told the Domei corres- 
pondent he ate t^wice daily because 
he wanted the Japanese soldiers to 
get any surplus. He said he kept

British Submarines 
Sink 74 Jap Ships 



LONDON — British submarines 
have sunk 74 additional Japanese 
vessels and damaged 25 others in 
recent Far Eastern patrols, the 
British Admiralty announced, 
raising the total sunk by. Royal 
Navy undersea craft to 341 . 

The latest Japanese shipping 
casualties included a small tanker, 
four escort ships, and a large num- 
ber of junks, landing craft and 
coastal vessels. British operations 
provided an important supplement 
to the attrition campaign waged by 
American submarines which have 
sent to the bottom over 1,000 Jap- 
anese ships since Pearl Harbor. 

During the recent patrols, one 
British submarine fought a run- 
ning gun battle with a convoy of 
five JaD coastal vessels and an 



fesor ran for office, won, ran in 
the next election and won again 

The war caught Confesor in Ma- 
nila from which he made his way 
^sailboat to Panay in March, 
• xt President Quezon was then 
m Negros, on his way to Australia. 
Quezon summoned Confesor and 
told him to assume the post of 
governor of Iloilo. 

When Panay was invaded in 
April, 1942, Confesor went to the 
mountains and established the lo- 
cal Commonwealth government 
He extended his jurisdiction to Ca- 
piz and Antique, finally to Rom- 
blon. He organized a provincial 
guard sometime in July, 1942, later 
on turned over to the military com- 
mand all standard arms except 
small arms and shotguns for po- 
lice work. 

Twice he was nearly captured 
by the Japanese. Once the Japa- 
nese chased him without let-up for 
45 days. Typhoid attacked him and 
for 30 days he hovered between life 
and death. Had the Japanese had 
word of his condition, they could 
have penetrated his security area 
and taken him while he lay help- 
less. 

Last December, at the request of 
President Osmena, General xMac- 
Arthur sent two officers to bring 
Confesor to Leyte, Confesor's next 
stop was Manila. 



Rehabilitation Discussed 



The program of rehabilitation 
in the Philippines was the timely 
subject of discussion by members 
of the Cosmopolitan Student 
Church, Manila, yesterday. The 
meeting, under the leadership of 
Bishop Cipriano Navarro, was 
held at the Baptist church. 



New French Association 



To bring together the members 
of the French colony in Manila 
and help French families in need 
of relief, Frenchmen formerly in- 
terned at Santo Tomas have or- 
ganized the "Association des Fran- 
cais aux Philippines" with Georges 
Bonnet as chairman. 

All persons of French birth 
wishing to join the association are 
requested to apply in writing to 
the secretary, in care of the Amer- 
ican Chamber of Commerce. Those 
in need of relief should file a list 
of their dependents, indicating the 
nature of the aid required* 



Ballet To Be Revived 



The "Manila Ballet Moderne" 
directed by Trudl Dubsky and 
sponsored before the war by the 
"Asociacion Musical de Filipinas" is 
being revived. During the Japa- 
nese occupation of the city, the 
"Manila Ballet Moderne" discon- 
tinued its activities. In order to 
facilitate the reorganization of 
the ballet troupe, Miss Dubsky 
requests all its members to re- 
port to her studio at 97 Balirfe*

Public Given 
Free X Ray 
Ssrvice Here 



The city health department hai 
opened an X-ray service for the 
public, as a preventative measure 
against tuberculosis. The depart- 
ment is using a mobile X-ray ma- 
chine in the San Lazaro hospital 
on Rizal Avenue. 

San Lazaro is the only govern- 
ment hospital at present 'receiving 
tuberculosis cases for treatment. 
Quezon Institute, the largest sana- 
torium in the country before the 
war, was found practically empty 
by American troops upon their ar- 
rival. 

Before the* war, the sanatorium 
had about 600 patients. Shortly 
after the Japanese occupation, 
the Japs took over the hospital. 
All patients were sent to their 
homes, except for loO who were 
taken to the San Juan de Dios hos- 
pital in Intramuros. 

A Quezon Institute doctor re- 
ported that only four girls and 
two men of the 150 patients and 
hospital staff survived the mas- 
sacre during the sieg* of the 
Walled City. 



Prices of Foodstuffs 
Decline in Manila 



Commodity prices in Manila 
have gone down considerably, ac- 
cording to Jose C. de Vega, chief 
of the price control division of the 
provost marshal general's office. 
The fall in the price of prime 
commodities is especially notice- 
able in the case of rice which, im- 
mediately after the arrival of the 
American liberation forces, was 
f4 to Po a ganta. Today rice is 
sold in the black market for aa 
little as PI a ganta. 

However, the official price for 
rice is Manila is 32 centavos a 
ganta, and the price control divi- 
sion is curbing the activities of 
profiteers by forcing vendon to 
sell at the government price. With 
the division agents in action, the 
public is now able to buy beef at PI 
a kilo, pork and carabao meat at 80 
centavos a kilo, eggs at 10 centavos 
each, camotes at 10 centavos a kilo, 
and milkfish at 50 centavos a kilo. 

De Vega said the prices of such 
prime commodities as milk, fish 
and eggs are still higher than the 
ceiling prices set by the govern- 
ment. However, he it confident 
that, as more food supplies arrive 
from the provinces vendors will be 
forced to cut ther prices without 
any prodding from the authorities. 



MANDALAY — British troops 
controlled virtually all of Manda- 
lay Sunday, and complete cap- 
ture of the historic river port and 
Burma's second largest city was 
imminent, frontline dispatches 
said. Enemy resistance was 
crumbling rapidly in the center of 
the city.

Cabinet O.K/s Policy of No 
Employment of Collaborators 

The policy that mil persona who i jority of 18 million Filipino no 



collaborated with the enemy should 
be removed from offices of author- 
ity and influence over the political 
and economic life of the country 
has been approved by the Com- 
monwealth cabinet, according to 
the department of information. 

"Pressure of circumstances/' ex- 
plained the department, "which de- 
manded the immediate reorganiza- 
tion of certain public offices, com- 
pelled us to reemploy temporarily 
officials and employees who re- 
mained in the public service under 
the Japanese regime, If they are 
found to have collaborated with 
the enemy, they will be separated 
from public office immediately," 

The department of information 
announced further that anyone 
knowing facta about the conduct of 
persons temporarily reemployed by 
the various departments of the 
Commonwealth government will be 
performing a patriotic duty "if he 
furnishes us or the Counter Intelli- 
gence Corps with information on 
each of them." 

The government** policy is stated 
to be in accord with President 
Roosevelt's announced policy that 
"all those who collaborated with 
the enemy should be kept out of 
offices of authority and influence 
over the political and economic life 
of the country/' 

In a letter to the Free Philip- 
pines, Benjamin B. Viloria of Ma- 
nila has challenged Secretary 
K&law's recent announcement to 
the effect that "civil service em- 
ployees who served under the Ja- 
panese have lost their standing*" 

In answer, Viloria referred to 
the stand taken by President Ser- 
gio Osmena in a radio address de- 
livered over the "Voice of Free- 
dom" November 23, 1944, and dec- 
lared that Secretary Kalaw's 
statement "has been improperly 
made." Viloria quoted the follow- 
ing section of President Osmefia's 
address; 

"We cannot close our eyes to the 
realities of tfip .Tnoanfw* omm^ 
tiom An arbitrary eoTtminent 
imposed by the pword left the mil- 



other recourse but to submit to a 
despotic regime if they were to 
survive, Not all public officials 
could take to the hills to carry on 
the heroic struggle, Some had to 
remain at their post to protect the 
population from the oppressor and 
to comfort the people in their mi- 
aery* 

"Had their services not been 
available, the Japanese would 
either have themselves governed 
directly and completely or utilized 
unscrupulous Filipino followers 
capable of any treason to their 
people. 

"The problem under considera- 
tion must be solved with justice 
and dignity. Every case should be 
examined impartially and decided 
on its own merits. The motives 
which caused the retention of the 
office and conduct while in office, 
rather than the sole fact of its 
occupation, ought to be the crite- 
rion upon which such persona will 
be judged/' the President con- 
cluded, 

"Unless President Osmefia has 
changed his view, or the govern- 
ment has adopted a definite policy 
on the matter," Viloria's letter 
concluded, "I believe the Ealaw 
announcement has been improper- 
ly made*"

of the United St* tea Army medical

on it* voyage from the Philippine! 
m He followed the history 

of the ship until its return to the 
Islands in 1944, 

When war broke out the Amir- 
i can Red Crosi called for volun- 
teer doctors to serve on tht Mac- 
tan, which was carrying wound*d 
men from Manila, Corregidor and 
Clark Field, to Australia and rel^ 
tive safety. JEscudero and fivt 
other physicians volunteered; they 
left Manila on New Year'* Eve, 
1941, three day* before the city's

The Mactan wa* a amall inter, 
island vessel The 300 people on 
board, excluding personnel and 
crew, were jammed into its tiny 
hold. The dining-room was con- 
verted into an operating-room 
during the trip- 
It was the first trip out of Phil- 
ippine waters ever made by tht 

IMaetan's skipper, Captain Tama- 
yo, who had only an ordinary geo- 
graphic map. But the Mactta 
reached Macassar where the Putch 
put supplies and oil aboard. One 
Filipino and an American were bu- 
ried there before the vessel moved 
out, It stopped at Timor for water. 
Soon afterward the men and women 
aboard heard Tokyo broadcast that 
the Mactan had been bombed and 
sunk. They did not know whether 
to laugh or cry at the announce- 
ment, 

The Mactan, considered lost br 
the Allies, reached Australia and 
stopped at Port Darwin. However, 
it could not unload its wounded 
passengers there due to luck of 
hospital facilities. From Port 
Darwin, the ship touched Towns* 
ville, Brisbane, and finally Sydney 
where the soldiers were hospital* 
teed. 

Doctor* and nurses on board the 
Mactan were asked by the Austra- 
lian government to organize a Red 
Cross unit in Sydney. Several, 
including Capt. Francisco Ro- 
man, delivered lectures to Austra- 
lian audiences on the Philippine 
and the Filipinoa.

GUAM — A strong force of 
American carrier planes attacked 
air bases and installations on the 
Japanese home island of Kyushu 
Sunday, a brief Navy bulletin an- 
nounced yesterday. 

No details were available im- 
mediately on the Kyushu attack, 
which presumably was carried 
out on the same scale as the 
series of heavy attacks last month 
on Tokyo and other points on 
Honshu island to the north. 

In the February operations, a 
large carrier task force under 
Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's 
command steamed within less than 
300 miles of Tokyo, destroyed or 
damaged over 600 planes, knocked 
out three important aircraft fac- 
tories, and blasted 33 enemy ves- 
sels in Tokyo Bay. 

Illustrating the Navy's ability to 
strike simultaneously from any di- 
rection, American 9th Fleet battle- 
wagons appeared Friday 1,000 
miles north of Japan, steaming into 
the Kuriles to bombard Matuwa is- 
land. They started fires and set 
off heavy explosions without' suf- 
fering damage. 

Tuazon Named Asst 
Police Chief of City 

Capt. Angel Tuazon, USAFFE, 
vesterday was appointed assistant 
chief of police of Manila by Col. 
Maurice E. Jones, deputy provost 
marshal general and chief of police. 
Tuazon succeeds Col. Antonio C. 
Torres, who resigned. 

Manila-bom, 42, and an Army 
man, Captain Tuazon saw action in 
Lingayen and in Bataan. He was 
first assistant of G-3, 21st division, 
under Brig. Gen. Mateo M. Capin- 
pin when the war began. Ordered 
to battle position in the Lingayen 
Gulf sector, Captain Tuazon and 
his men fought heroically against 
the enemy, contesting every inch of 
ground in a delaying action to Ba- 
taan. The last position held by 
Captain Tuazon was at Mt. Samat 
in Bataan, where the Fil-American

Men Who Did Not Serve 
Japs to Receive Back Pay 

No officer or enlisted man of the Philippine Army or Philippine 
Constabulary called into the service of the United States Forces 
in the Far East will be retained if he served in a military or civi- 
lian capacity in any Japanese controlled activity, the puppet repub- 
lic, or puppet government controlled agencies. This policy was 
promulgated yesterday by Secretary of National Defense Tomas 
Cabili, by direction of President 
Osmeiia and with the approval of 
the Commanding General of the 
USAFFE, Douglas MacArthur. 

The only exception to the policy, 
according to Cabili, are: "i. That 
the individual who may come un- 
der this category voluntarily 
ceased his connection on or before 
September 30, 1944 and joined and 
participated with either the guer- 
rilla troops or United States troops 
in operations. 2. Officers and en- 
listed men of the medical and 
chaplain service are excluded from 
this policy, provided that the du- 
ties performed were strictly in line 
of the medical profession or reli- 
gious activities." 

The order also stated that "all 
officers and enlisted men, assigned 
or unassigned, whose records indi- 
cate, or who have knowledge that 
an individual comes under this ca- 
tegory, will submit to this head- 
quarters a report by name, rank, 
army serial number and present 
organization of the individual so 
reported; and a special signed and 
certified affidavit setting fonth 
the pertinent facts of his service 
under the Japanese." 

Regarding the collection of back- 
salaries for USAFFE men, the 
defense secretary issued the follow- 
ing general rule: 
"1. USAFFE enlisted men and 

B-29's Hit Nagoya for 
Second Time In One Week 



40th Infantry 
Hits Beach 
iday 



officers who served the Japanese 
ceased to receive their salaries on 
the day they acceptd employment 
under the Japanese. They only re- 
gain their right to pay if they 
severed their connection with the 
Japanese one month before D-Day 
in the Philippines and joined a 
guerrillla organization of good 
standing and participated actively 
in the activities of the guerrillas. 

"2. USAFFE enlisted men and 
officers who surrendered but did 
not serve under the Japanese after 
release are entitled to pay, even if 
they did not join a resistance 
movement. 

"3. USAFFE enlisted men and 
officers who joined the guerrillas 
shall receive extra compensation, 
the same chargeable to* tie intelli- 
gence fund of the United States or 
Allied Intelligence Bureau." 

The Secretary of National De- 
fense gave out the reasons for the 
policy as: "First, to establish a 
precedent; second, The army is no 
place for divided loyalty; third, 
disloyalty in any form should be 
punished; fourth, the claim that 
there are those who served with 
the Japs who secretly helped the 
guerrilla movement mannot alter 
the fact of disloyalty. What gua- 
rantte do we have that these men 
will be loyal to us in a crisis.? 



WASHINGTON— A "very large 
force" of B-29 superfortresses re- 
turned to the Japanese mainland 
Monday morning to attack the 
great industrial city of Nagoya

quarters announced. Incendiary 
bombs were used "in very great

American troops have landed on 
Panay, General Douglas MacAr- 
thur announced this morning. The 
landing followed the invasion of 
Mindanao by one week. 

The 40th infantry division of the 
U. S. Eighth army stormed ashore 
Sunday morning with heavy naval 
and air support, achieved complete 
surprise, and quickly established a 
large beachhead at Tigbauan on 
the south coast, 14 miles west of 
the capital city of Iloilo. The land- 
ing force suffered practically no 
loss. 

The troops immediately drove 
inland four miles to Cordova and 
eastward along the coast seven 
miles to Oton, midway between the 
beachhead and Iloilo. The commu- 
nique said the Americans are ra- 
pidly closing in on the capital. 

On Luzon, an additional 2,654 
Japanese have been killed in mop- 
ping-up operations in the Zambales 
mountains, by the 38th infantry 
division. 

Earlier reports Indicated that 
troops of the XI Corps, fighting 
east of Manila, had stepped up the 
tempo of their advance into the 
hills of the Marikina watershed. 
The Sixth and 43rd divisions were 
reported driving rapidly into the 
enemy's secondary defenses along 
the valley of the upper Bosoboso

Poison Liquor Kills 11 Soldiers Here 



Gov't Will Wage 
War On Black Market 



"The government is determined 
to destroy the black market, and no 
strike on the part of any frroup 
of black-marketeers will detain us 
in carrying out our program," To- 
mns Confesor* secretary of the in- 
teriors declared yesterday. 

Confesor had been informed that 
a group of market vendors pro- 
posed to go on strike, on account 
of the measures being taken by the 
government to eradicate the black 
market, 

M In this connection," said Con- 
fesor, <4 I would like to assure the 
people of Manila that we are pre- 
pared to meet that eventuality* As 
secretary of the interior, I will use 
every means in my power to prevent 
and stop any disturbance of law 
and order within the city, and I 
will deal sternly and firmly with 
any lawless elements, 

"The welfare and well-being of 
the people of Manila are Over and 
above the selfish interests of any 
group of individuals," he conclud- 
ed. "This government will not 
allow anyone who has been accus- 
tomed to flaunt the law during the 
last three years to do the same to- 
day/* | 



Poisonous liquor peddled by un- 
scrupulous individuals or sold in 
unsanitary, makeshift restaurants 
in Manila has caused 11 deaths and 
four cases of blindness, Col. M. E. 
Jones, chief of police, stated yes- 
terday. Victims of the poison liquor 
were American soldiers, who had 
been warned by Army authorities 
not to eat in any restaurant until 
it has been officially approved. 

The military police recently 
raided several bottling plants 
where conditions were unsanitary. 
They found liquor being bottled in 
buildings housing horses, carabaos 
and oxen. 

The police have in custody a doz- 
en Chinese and Filipinos, charged 
with violation of the internal rev- 
enue law in regard to the manu- 
facture and sale" of liquor. Colonel 
Jones pointed out that every liquor 
peddler is a law violator and will

The police and medical author- 
ities, on inspecting city restaurants, 
have not found one that meets the 
minimum sanitary requirements. 
However, unsanitary conditions in 
Manila are being rapidly corrected, 
Colonel Jones stated, and as public 
eating houses meet the minimum 
standard of sanitation, they will be 
officially approved and publicized 
in the newspaper 



LONDON— One thousand offi- 
cers and men of the German army 
have been executed by mobile

said Saturday. 



Pope Points Dangers 
Along Road To Peace 

VATICAN CITY — Pope Pius 
XII, speaking to a great crowd 
in St. Pater's Square, declared 
Sunday that the road from armis- 
tice to peace is covered with 
shadows which may conceal grave 
dangers* 

Ambition and greed both were 
present in war, the pope said, 
appealing to those "seduced by 
extreme nationalism, racism and 
theories of violence to embrace 
the ideals of Christian fraternity. 

He called for formation of 
"pure healthy youth" through 
education, sports, and recreation 
to lift the human family from its 
depths of great misfortune. 

CHUNGKING — Chinese troops 
driving north toward Kanhsien, a 
former American air base m 
Kiangsi province, on Sunday were

quarter*. 



Guerrillas Ask Right 
To Continue Fighting 

Inspired ty the recent visit to 
the city of its commanding gen- 
eral, commanders of the different 
units of the Bernard L. Anderson 
Guerrillas, with a claimed fight- 
ing strength of 70,000 men, yester- 
day approved a resolution to re- 
quest General MacArthur to give 
them the opportunity to continue 
the fight against Japan. 

Little known in Manila, the 
Anderson Guerrillas were active 
in the coastal towns of Tavabas, 
where they have their headquarters, 
and also in Laguna, Bulacan and 
Manila, The outfit was lirgely 
engaged in intelligence work and 
communications.

Teopisto Guingona has been ap-

ritructed the commissioner to extend 
full cooperation to the United 
States forces in the designation of 
persons who can be temporarily ap- 
pointed to positions in the govern- 
ment service* 

"In matters of appointment, you 
will be guided by the present policy 
of the government that no one who 
has, in one way or another, co- 
operated with the defunct Republic 
of the Philippines, should be ap- 
pointed to government position!," 
Secretary Confesor recently wrote 
Guingona, "You should give pref- 
erence to persons who, in some 
measure, are qualified for positions 
which they will fill, who are honest 
and loyal to the United States of 
America and to the Commonwealth 
government, and above all to those 
who actively engaged in guerrilla 
activities in the mountains." 



Wallace Sees Bright 
Future for Aviation 



WASHINGTON— Secretary of 
Commerce Henry Wallace haa 
urged the Senate commerce com- 
mittee to take prompt action on 
aviation bills for the establishment 
of a nationwide system of airports* 

Comparing the situation in avia- 
tion today with the situation when 
automobiles were first becoming 
popular in 1904, Wallace estimated 
that within two years after the de- 
feat of Japan aviation could give 
support to 200,000 workers. He es- 
timated that ten years later 4,000,- 
000 workers would be earning their 
living through aviation.

PARIS— American Thirc Army 
tanks advanced swiftly into the 
upper corner of the Saar Basin 
Sunday, precipitating a disorgan- 
ized race for the eastern bank of 
the Rhine by thousands- of Ger- 
man troops south of captured 
Coblenz. . 

Third Army elements pulled up 
at the Rhine west bank along a 
10-mile front 18 miles south of 
Coblenz, while other units- cap 
tured scores of towns in the 
Mosdle-Saar triangle. The last 
enemy resistance in Coblenz was 
being wiped out in hand-to-hand 
fighting 

To the north, U.S. First Arm£ 
forces expanded their bridgehead 
on the east bank of the Rhine to 
an area 14 miles long and over 7 
miles deep, despite the loss of the 
Ludendorff Bridge at Rem age n 
which collapsed Saturday, Sup- 
plies were moved across the Rhine 
over pontoon bridges. 

Over 2,000 U. S, bombers and 
fighters staged the largest day- 
light attack of the war on Berlin 
Sunday, hitting communications 
in the capital and arms plants in 
the suburbs. They dropped over 
12,000 demolition and 650,000 in- 
cendiary bombs. At least 13 Ger- 
man jet-propelled fighters, were 
shot down.

SAN FRANCISCO— After three 
years imprisonment by Japanese in 
the Philippines, 320 American sol- 
diers returned to their homeland 
Friday to receive the tribute and 
homage of San Francisco ? s thou- 
sands. Last week 275 who were 
liberated came home. Also aboard 
the second transport were 7S en-

MOSCOW — The civilian popula- 
tion of Tokyo was thrown into pan- 
ic beyond the authorities' ability 
to control during the heavy B-29 
pre-dawn attack on the Japanese 
capital last week, according to the 
Tokyo correspondent of the Soviet 
Tass Agency. Six days after the 
assault, refugees were still crowd- 
ing railway stations in an effort to 
leave the capital. 

"Everywhere are various types 
of vehicles, from trucks to rick- 
shaws loaded with the belongings 
of people evacuating the city" 
Tass said, "Three days following 
the bombing raid, sufferers were 
wandering about in places reduced 
to ashes, hoping to find out if their

U.S. CARRIER FORGE 
lAPAN'S FLEET IN INLAND SEA 



Most of Panay 
Is Cleaned Up 
By Guerrillas 

American troops drove east 
along the coast of Panay to cap- 
ture the devastated city of Iloilo 
on Tuesday, General MacArthur's 
communique announced this morn- 
ing. Approximately seventy per- 
cent of the "second city of the 
Philippines" was destroyed by the 
Japanese before MacArthur's men 
forced an entry. The docks, how- 
ever, were safe and the harbor 
clear. 

Guerrilla forces under Colonel 
Macario Peralta, Jr., had practi- 
cally cleared the interior and coas- 
tal sectors of Panay before the 
American landing Sunday. Enemy 
forces on the island were res- 
tricted to the immediate vicinity. 

General MacArthur has award- 
ed the Distinguished Service Cross 
to Colonel Peralta. The presen- 
tation was made by Lt. Gen. Ro- 
bert Eichelberger, Eighth Army 
commander, at Iloilo immediately 
following its capture. 

Earlier reports from Mac Ar- 
thur's headquarters indicated con- 
tinued gains on Luzon and Minda- 
nao and complete control of stra- 
tegic Basilan island. 

Guerrilla forces in northern Lu- 
zon captured San Fernando, La 
Union, destroying the enemy gar- 
rison and securing the principal 
port on the east shore of Lingayen 
gulf. At the same time, elements 
of the 33rd division drove north 
for a ten-mile gain to Bauang, 
only six miles south of San Fer- 
nando. Quick action saved two 
large bridges on the coastal road 
from demolition. 

Other units pushed north along 
Kennon road to take Camp Three, 
on the road to Baguio. The Sixth 
and 43rd divisions were continuing 
their rapid drive into the enemy 
secondary defenses in the Mari- 
kina watershed, east of Manila. 
The Eleventh Airborne division 
captured San Jose hill and the 
west slope of Mount Macolod, 
southeast of Lake Taal. 

Air units maintained close sup 
port of ground troops, hammering 
enemy positions on Cebu and Ne- 
gros, and destroying enemy supply 
and fuel dumps at Ipo, Vigan and 



Nazi Defenses 
Collapse South 
Of Cologne 



PARIS — German defenses col- 
lapsed south of Cologne Tuesday 
as Gen. Patton's Third Army 
tanks knifed through the upper 
corner of the Saar Basin, entered 
Mainz, then swung southward to 
overrun Worms, Kaiserlautern 
and 43 other towns, sealing off all 
escape routes for 80,000 Germans 
trapped west of the Rhine. 

In a whirlwind seven-day drive, 
Patton's men inflicted 45,000 ca- 
sualties on the pocketed Germans 
inside the Rhine-Moselle-Saar 
triangle. Armored spearheads 
which took Mainz traveled 14 miles 
eastward up the Rhine in 24 hours 
from Bingen. The fall of Kaiser- 
lautern flanked the big industrial 
city of Saarbrucken from the east, 
and brought Third Army tanks 
within 15 miles of a junction with 
the Seventh Army, which broke 
through the Siegfried Line along 
the northern Alsace frontier. 

The lighting Third Army thrust 
set up for the kill the entire Ger- 
man First Army. 



U.S. Fliers Damage 13 Major 
Warships, K.0^477 Planes 

GUAM — American carrier aircraft on Monday searched out and 
did "crippling damage" to main units of the Japanese fleet at their 
home bases in the Inland Sea. 

In this attack and in Sunday's on Kobe and Kure, results of which 
had not previously been announced, the Navy fliers damaged at least 
13 enemy warships and destroyed 477 Japanese aircraft. 



Admiral Chester W Nimitz an- 
nounced Wednesday that the fa- 
mous Task Force 58, under Vice 
Admiral Marc A. Mitscher, at- 
tacked principal units of the Jap- 
anese fleet at their home bases, 
after moving northeast on the sec- 
ond day of the two-day assault 
on Kobe and Kure in the southern 
Japanese islands. 

Vice Admiral R. A. Spruance, 
chief of the American Fifth Fleet 
and who was in tactical command 
of the forces engaged, issued the 
following report of damage in- 
flicted in the double carrier as- 
sault: 

Sunk, six small freighters; dam- 
aged, one or two battleships, two 
or three aircraft carriers, two 
light aircraft carriers or escort 
carriers, one heavy cruiser, one 
light cruiser, four destroyers, one 
submarine one destroyer escort 



We Resume Publication 



A city-wide wave of protest followed the discon- 
tinuance of the Manila FREE PHILIPPINES, which 
ceased publication on Tuesday. It was generally felt, 
in both military and political circles, that the time had 
not yet come when pHvately financed publications could 
do an adequate job of disseminating news and informa- 
tion to the people of Manila. 

General MacArthur believes, and has frequently 
stated that news is as essential as bullets and bread on 
the fighting front. Today Manila stands in the front 
lines. It must have neivs, accurate and honest news, 
if it's citizens are to play their full part in the war 
against Japan. 

To fulfill this need we have decided to resume 
publication of the Manila FREE PHILIPPINES. So 
long as present conditions continue, we shall try to give 
Manila a straight- forward, unbiased, informative news- 
paper. As soon as the need for this paper has passed, 
it will go out of business. 



and seven freighters; 202 aircraft 
shot down in combat, 275 des- 
troyed on the ground, more than 
100 others damaged in just the 
first day's attack; a large number 
of installations including hangars, 
shops, arsenals and oil storage fa- 
cilities destroyed. 

American aircraft losses in com- 
bat were extremely light. Though 
the enemy made many air attacks 
on our forces, none of our ships 
was lost. One vessel was seriously 
damaged and it is returning to 
port under its own power. A few 
others suffered minor damage 
but are in full operation, the Navy 
stated. 

In hitting Kobe Sunday, the 
American fliers pounded Japan's 
largest shipbuilding city and port 
while it was still smouldering 
from Saturday's 2,500-ton fire 
bomb attack by 300 Super-Fort- 
resses. Prime military targets at 
Kure included aircraft engine 
plants and one of the four major 
navy yards in Japan. The Kure 
area is one of the most strongly 
fortified in the Japanese home is- 
lands. 

Japanese broadcasts estimated 
the strength of the carrier planes 
in Sunday's attack at 1,400, and 
said objectives on Shikoku and in 
the Osaka-Kobe area were at- 
tacked for ten hours. 



Attack Opens Drive 
To Destroy Jap Fleet 

WASHINGTON— The campaign 
to hunt down and destroy the Jap- 
anese fleet in its hiding places has 
begun. Commenting Tuesday on 
the damaging attack on main units 
of the Japanese navy by American 
carrier planes, a Navy spokesman 
said: 

"The Inland Sea is probably one 
of the major hiding places of their 
fleet and provides the best refuge. 
It won't be that very long. This is 
the beginning of a campaign to 
hunt down their ships wherever 
they are holed up, and to sret

Rafael Trias Named 
Governor of Cavite 



Rafael Trias has been installed 
in office as provincial governor of 
Cavite, it was announced at Mala- 
canan yesterday. 

The new governor is the son of 
General Trias of revolutionary 
fame, and was born in a town 
named after the general. He is a 
graduate of the University of the 
Philippines, and received his de- 
gree of bachelor of science and 
commerce from the University of 
Illinois. 

Trias served for five years as 
private secretary to the late Pres- 
ident Quezon, and was secretary to 
the second Osmena mission to the 
United States in 1927. His father 
was the first civil governor of the 
province under the Americans. 



Congress Studies Bill to Use 
Armed Force to Enforce Peace 



New Australian Force 
Ready to Hit Japs 

SAN FRANCISCO — Deputy 
Prime Minister Francis M. Forde 
of Australia declared here Mon- 
day that Australia has assigned 
to General MacArthur a new 
striking force for use in eliminat- 
ing 250,000 by-passed Japanese in 
the Southwest Pacific islands. 
Forde is en route to London, and 
will return here to attend the 
world security conference next 
month. 



Judge Sees Chance 
To Reform Offenders 

Since most police records in Ma- 
nila have been destroyed, habitual 
law violators now have an oppor- 
tunity to turn over a new leaf 
and become useful citizens, Judge 
Guillermo Cabrera of the Meisic 
branch of the municipal court dec- 
lared yesterday. 

In imposing sentences on per- 
sons accused of law violation, their 
past records — if they had any — 
are not looked into anymore, he 
added. Consequently the penalty 
imposed is generally the minimum, 
all being treated as first effen- 
dera. 

In a memorandum to Secretary 
of Justice Delfin Jaranilla, Col. 
Maurice E. Jones, deputy provost 
marshal general and chief of po- 
lice of Manila, has recommended 
the imposition of more severe pe- 
nalties and the fixing of higher 
bail in criminal court action. 



WASHINGTON— The House of 
Representatives has before it a 
proposal that would give effective- 
ness to American cooperation in 
any international security organi- 
zation that is established. A bill in- 
troduced Monday by Representa- 
tive Herman P. Kopplemann, a De- 
mocrat, provides that the American 
representative on such a security 
body shall have the authority, 
after consulting with specific Uni- 
ted States officials, to pledge use 
of "specific numbers and types of 
military forces." 

Kopplemann explained that the 
authorities to be consulted would 
include the president, secretary of 
state and chairmen of the Senate 
Foreign Relations and House For- 
eign Affairs Committees. He added 
that the pledge of American mili- 
tary forces would be limited to the 
numbers and types agreed upon by 
the several nations. 

"These forces," he continued, 
"shall be used to enforce jointly 
the decisions of the international 
security organization as they re- 
late to prevention or suppression 
of threats to the peace or breaches 
of the peace between nations. This « 
means our representative can pro- 
ceed to cast our vote for imme- 
diate action to enforce peace and 
prevent war by use of the armed 
forces of the international security 
organization. 

"Any pledge of the use of armed 
forces of the United States so gi- 
ven shall be binding upon the gov- 
ernment of the United States and 
shall be implemented immediately 
by the proper authorities." 

Kopplemann made clear that his 
bill does not deprive Congress of 
the right to declare war. He said : 
"Police action is not war. Police 
action implies a well organized 
force on the side of law and speedy 
subjection of any individual or 
group of individuals opposed to 
law." 

The Kopplemann bill is timely, 
as a United Nations conference 
will open in San Francisco April 
25 to further formation of a world 
security organization as envisaged 
by the Dumbarton Oaks conference 
last Tea?.

WASHINGTON— United States 
submarines have sunk 15 more

A Navy communique lists the 
latest victims of the American

tanker, eight cargo ships and a 
medium sized transport.

CAP TUBED IQUIPM*^^ 



By repairing an average of 75 
leaks a day, Major Lloyd K. Clark, 
who is in charge of putting the 
shape, believes that water service 
Metropolitan waterworks system in 
can be made available to all the 
remaining sections of unburned 
Manila with the next week or 10 
days. 

According to Major Clark, about 
800 leaks in Manila's water lines 
have been repaired since the Amer- 
icans came in a little more than a 
month ago. 

At present, only parts of Tondo 
and a few isolated sections in the 
southern district are still unserved. 
In such places the U. S. Army still 
maintains water distribution 
points, huge canvas water tanks 
serviced by military trucks. Twen- 
ty-four such distribution points 
are still being maintained, 11 
south of the Pasig river and 13 in 
the south. 



Japs Harass Remote 
Towns In Bulacan 



Though Bulacan province has 
been liberated, the out-of-the-way 
towns of Angat and Norzagaray 
are still continually harassed at 
night by Jap stragglers coming 
down from the surrounding hills, 
according to Marciano Leonardo, a 
resident of Angat. 

Life in these towns has been ab- 
normal since the first week of Feb- 
ruary, Leonardo said. The towns 
people stay in their homes for a 
few hours during the day and 
leave for safer places elsewhere 
before nightfall. 

Leonardo said the Japs spread 
terror among the inhabitants by 
setting houses on fire, shooting 
civilians, and carrying away live- 
stock, fruits and chickens when- 
ever they descend from their hide- 
outs. As a result of this terrorism, 
hundreds of sacks of palay in the' 
towns have not been threshed. 
Poultry and fruit-growing, which 
used to be lucrative industries be- 
fore the war, have been abandoned.

Chungking also announced that

Plans to Step Up Air Attacks 
On Japan Under Discussion 



MIAMI, Fla, — Plans to step 

up the air offensive against Japan 
were discussed this week at a con- 
ference between Lt, Gen. George 
C, Kenney, commanding the Far 
Eastern Air Force under Gen, 
MacArthur, and Gen. Henry H. 
Arnold, commander of Army Air 
Forces. . • - 

Gen, Kenney said one purpose of 
his trip to the United States was 
to obtain more planes. He cited 
as evidence of American air power 
in the Pacific the job done in the 
Philippine* in preparing the way 
for Gen. MaeArthur's assault 
troops. 

"On Luzon," he said, "we nit 
from the air everything the Japs 
had. We kept vehicles from mov- 
ing on roads. It was more of a 
maneuver than a fi^ht," , 
Japan, Gen. Arnold declared the 

Discussing new air blows at 
Army plans "to get as many bases 
a& we con within striking distance 
of Japan, so that we can put the 
maximum number of planes in the 
air over Japan." 

Bombing tactics used on Ger- 
many will be applied to Japan, 
Arnold said, "to deprive the enemy 
of everything we can take away 
from him." This would include 
destruction of transportation lines, 
gasoline stores and arms produc- 
tion. 



TOKYO — The stopping of all 
except one express train was ef- 
fected Tuesday, aa a result of the 
series of B-29 assault? on Japan- 
ese cities, The ex; re^s service 
between Tokyo and Shimonoseki, 
gateway to the China mainland, 
was the only one retained. The 
order was issued to save transpor- 
tion facilities for carrying eva- 
cuees frm the bombed cities, ac- 
cording to the Japanese radio.

Allied Fliers Wreck 
All But One German 
Sy ithetic Oil Plant: 

LONDON — The smashing Al- 
lied aerial offensive has knocked 
out all but one of Germany's syn- 
thetic oil plants. In addition, only 
19 of her 78 coke ovena are in 
operation. 

This was revealed Monday by a 
spokesman high in Britain's war 
councils, as 1,800 American bom- 
bers and fighters hit jet plane ins- 
tallations and war industries in 
southern Germany. At the same 
time British airmen showered 
bombs on viaducts in the Ruhr in- 
dustrial area. These strikes fol- 
lowed by one day the record Amer- 
ican daylight assault on Berlin by 
over 1,300 Flying Fortresses and 
Liberators. 

Monday's targets of the Amer- 
ican planes ranged from Leipzig 
in eastern Germany to Ulm, 60 
miles from the Swiss border. For 
the second straight day, the Ger- 
man interceptor planes offered 
combat in what is now considered 
strength for the Nasi air arm. 
At least 34 of German aircraft 
were shot down*

Yanks Trap Two Nazi A rmies West of Rhine 



Germans Lose 
100,000 Men In 
Saar Campaign 

PARIS — Converging columns of 
American Third and Seventh 
Army troops streamrollered oppo- 
sition in Germany's industrial 
Saar Basin Wednesday to climax 
one of the greatest German de- 
bacles of the entire Western Front 
campaign. 

The German defeat appeared 
likely to cost Hitler's flattened 
armies close to 100,000 casualties, 
front line dispatches said. Two 
German armies — the First and 
Seventh — either were wiped out 
or trapped. 

General Patton's Third Army 
columns, striking from the north, 
circled deep info the Saarland, en- 
tered the great chemical centers 
of Ludwigshafen and Mannheim, 
and fought inside Mainz. Cities 
such as Saarbrucken, Kaiserlau- 
tern, Worms Voelkingen, Zwei- 
bruecken, Homberg, and Saint 
Egbert toppled like ten-pins. The 
looping American advance sheafed 
off all eastward escape routes for 
what remained of Germany's 
armies west of the Rhine. 

The Third Army alone jammed 
30,000 German troops into prison 
stockades within 48 hours, Su- 
preme Allied headquarters esti- 
mated. The Third joined with the 
American Seventh to spring a 
giant trap which may. raise the 
overall total of captured to 75,000. 

The Seventh Army, driving up 
from southern bases in the Saar- 
land and Palastinate districts, did 
not even tabulate its prisoners be- 
yond the first 6,000. In all, 27 
American divisions were involved 
in the lightning campaign which 
overran all German opposition 
south of Cologne. 

North of the Saar, the American 
First army east of the Rhine 
lengthened its bridgehead to 25 
miles, in an advance of 12 miles to 
the southern limits of the Ruhr 
arsenal district.

Big Battleship, 
Eight Carriers 
Crippled by US 



GUAM — Late radio dispatches 
from Task Force 58 raise the 
damage done to the Japanese fleet 
on Monday in the Inland sea to at 
least 17 warships including one 
45,000-ton super battleship and 
eight aircraft carriers crippled, 
and not less than 600 airplanes 
destroyed or damaged. 

More than 1.000 American car- 
rier planes roared through intense 
anti-aircraft fire, and in some in- 
stances strong fighter opposition, 
to leave the warships smoking and 
bomb-twisted wrecks. Admiral 
Chester W. Nimitz reported the 
American "aircraft losses in com- 
bat were extremely light," and 
that no American ship was lost. 

Returning fliers said that one of 
the vessels damaged was a 45,000- 
ton battleship of the Yamato class, 
similar to the Mushasi sunk in the 
October battle of Leyte gulf when 
a sister ship, the Yamato, was 
damaged. At that time the two 
craft were Japan's two biggest 
battleships. 

A press dispatch said the Jan- 
anese ships scurried for shelter as 
the American planes attacked 
them in the supposed haven of the 
Inland sea. Enemy planes struck 
lepeatedly at Admiral Marc A. 
Mitscher's warships, which were 
defended by his carrier planes in 
fierce sky batt'es. One American- 
ship was seriously damaged and 
others suffered minor damage, but 
all were able to move away under 
their own. power. Returning pilots 
f.aid that the majority of the 
American planes lost were brought 
down by anti-aircraft fire, which 
they described as "heavy enough 
to walk on." 

•Nimitz declared the attack crip- 
pled the Japanese fleet at the time 
it was rushing repairs to meet the 
anticipated invasion of Japan it- 
self. "An American correspondent 
on Mitscher's flagship reported 
that "Japan's hopes of rebuilding 
her crippled airforce warsVdpp 



Koiso Calls Iwo 
Loss "Unfortunate" 



SAN FRANCISCO— Premier 
Koiso of Japan, in a radio 
broadcast recorded here, ad- 
mitted Wednesday the "loss of 
Iwo Jima is the most unfortu- 
nate thing in the whole war si- 
tuation." 

"'As a result," he grimly in- 
formed the Japanese people, 
"not only will American air 
raids over our homeland be 
further increased, but opportu- 
nities for an American invasion 
of Japan will be greater." 



Jap Inland Sea 
Loss tX Worse Than 
Pearl Harbor"-Harl 



WASHINGTON — "What we 
have done to the Japanese fleet in 
its Inland sea anchorage is more 
than the equivalent of Pearl Har- 
bor." Thus did Admiral C. Hart, 
retired former commander of Al- 
lied naval forces in Asiatic waters, 
sum up Monday's carrier attack. 

In a statement Wednesday, Hart 
pointed out: "To do the same to us, 
the Japanese would have to cross 
the Pacific — as we did — and strike 
at our ships and our naval instal- 
lations on the west coast of the 
United States. But they have not 
done this to us. It is we who have 
done it to them. The hopelessness 
of Japanese naval planning is now 
revealed. 

"At a time when the Japanese 
fleet was most needed — with the 
battle for Iwo Jima hardly con- 
cluded and the battle for the Phil- 
ippines under way — we had to go 
into Japan's Inland sea to seek 
out the Japanese fleet." 



Japs Lose 20,000 
Planes Since Sept. 1 

WASHINGTON— Since Sept. 1, 
the Far East Airforce, of which 
he is commander, and the U. S. 
Navy have definitely destroyed 
20,000 Japanese planes, Li Gen. 
George C. Kenney declared at a 
press conference Tuesday. 

Kenney implied that the Japa- 
nese airforce was no longer a 
threat because of shortages of 
planes and r?w materials and the

U.S. Forces 
Drive Ahead 
In Visayas 

While American troops ~ main- 
tained pressure on enemy forces 
on Panay and in the Zamboanga 
area of Mindanao, Eighth Army 
units jumped Iloilo Strait to make 
an amphibious landing on Guima- 
ras island, off the southeast coast 
of Panay, General MacArthur's 
communique announced this morn- 
ing. 

Control of Guimaras narrows 
the distance to Negros island and 
provides further protection for the 
harbor at Iloilo City, which Gen- 
eral MacArthur announced yester- 
day was clear. 

Meanwhile, General MacArthur's 
earlier communique announced 
that troops of the 33rd division 
on Luzon had linked up with guer- 
rilla forces which captured San 
Fernando, La Union and were 
driving east along the Naguilian 
trail toward Baguio. 

Enemy losses in the Marikina 
watershed, east of Manila, were 
reported extraordinarily heavy as 
XI corps units drove into the 
enemy second line of defense. The 
43rd division captured ridge lines 
north of Pantay while the Sixth 
division drove to within a mile of 
Mt. Baytangan. Captured Jap- 
anese equipment included 256 ve- 
hicles, mostly armored, 47 field 
pieces, including antiaircraft guns 
and mortars, 34 rocket launchers 
and large quantities of small 
arms, machineguns, food, ammu- 
nition, fuel and clothing. 

Cavite province was reported, 
clear of enemy units except for 
scattered remnants which were in 
flight. 

The 41st division, driving up the 
Zamboanga peninsula of Minda- 
nao, easily repulsed a series of 
night counterattacks. General 
MacArthur reported that Zam- 
boanga harbor had been cleared 
and that the airfields were operat- 
ing without hindrance. 

Two destroyer escorts and a 
6,000-ton freighter were sunk, 
two 7,000-ton freighter transports 
were set afire, and a destroyer 
damaged, when attacked by Aw«r-

Alejo Santos, the newly-appoint- 
ed governor of Bulacan, had been 
a guerrilla chief of his province 
for more than three years, He was 
still fighting against the Japs and 
the Makapilii when informed of 
his appointment to the governor- 
ship. 

m Santos was a member of the Ma- 
nila secret service when the war 
broke out. Enlisting in the Philip- 
pine Army, he was commissioned, 
fought in Bataan, and refused to 
surrender. With a few companions 
he set out in a sailboat to Sanda- 
kan, Borneo, in order to join the 
British forces there* Reaching 
Sandakan* he learned that the Japs 
had already taken the island, and 
returned to the Philippines, 

Santos organized a guerrilla 
group in Bulacan after securing 
authority from Maj. Bernard An- 
derson, guerrilla organizer and 
leader in southeastern Luzon, San-

WASHINGTON - Thirty-nine 
countries have signed the interim 
agreement of the international ci- 
vil aviation convention, and four 
nations^-the United States, Cana- 
da, the Netherlands and Norway— 
have accepted the convention. Mak- 
ing this announcement, Assistant 
Secretary of State Will U Clayton 
described the aviation convention 
as "literally a constitution for the 
post-war air world." The conven- 
tion will become effective upon ra- 
tification by 26 nations. 

Secretary of Public Works and 
Communication Sotero Cabahug 
has appointed engineers to survey 
the war-devastated areas and for- 
mulate a public works and recon- 
struction program for the next 6 
to 10 years. 

Some buildings are now being 
repaired to house government of- 
fices and establishments. Recon- 
struction of bridges, public build- 
ings, wharves and other public 
services are projected.

MIAMI, Fia,— The Japanese air 
torce "is not causing the losses it 
used to to our personnel," declare* 
ben H. H* Arnold, commanding 
tne^ American Army air forces, in 
an interview nere Tuesday, 

i.i W ?\? w ^ y ;t looka t0 now is 
that the Japanese air force has 
only a small number of trained 
men and a lot of green men," he 
added, "Every time we by-pass a 
pjace, the Japs lose not only equip- 
ment but also skilled personnel If 
we by-pass enough, they will have 
nothing but green people coming 
out of Japan." a 

In regard to the afr picture in 
Europe, Arnold said that Ger- 
many s jet planes have failed to 
measure up to Nazi claims and 
have shot down "very, very few*' 
Allied fighters or bombers. 



LONDON^The civilian popula- 
tion of Germany's industrial Ruhr 
valley was warned by the Allied 
nigh command Tuesday to eva- 
cuate the area for their own

a death trap." The message 
broadest by Allied radio stations 
said; 'To inhabitants of the Ruhr- 
Your hfe depends on immediate 
action. Get out of the Ruhr. Get 
out of the war." 



Hundreds of Filipinos rushed to 
the shore of Panay to greet the 
American forces when they landed

dent adds; "As doughboys of Maj,

neared the beach in alligators and 
small boats, hundred of Filipinos

Young Moro Seized Fort 
On Mmdanao With 21 Men 



The bitterest enemy of the Jap- 
anese in Lanao is Muhamad Di- 
maporo Ali, 23-year old Moro, who 
never misses an opportunity to 
ambush Japanese troops in the 
hills of Mindanao. In addition to 
patriotic reasons, he has a perso- 
nal one. 

Tomas Cabili secretary of na- 
tional defense, yesterday revealed 
the story of how Ali with 21 other 
Moros annihilated a Japanese gar- 
rison in Fort Corcuera, Malaban, 
Lanao, in June, 1944. 

"Muhamad is one of the unsung 
heroes of the Philippines," said the 
defense secretary. "He has not 
been given any medal but his 
bravery places him high in the 
hearts of his countrymen." 

Ali, the son of the sultan of Bi- 
nilayan, Lanao, was a law student 
of the University of the Philip- 
pines when the war broke out. 
Being an R.O.T.C. cadet, he was 
drafted and sent to Davao where 
he participated in the first encoun- 
ters between the USAFFE and 
Japanese invaders in December, 
1941, When the order to surren- 
der was given, Ali obeyed, was 
imprisoned and later released on 
parole. 

Unofficially, Ali cooperated with 
the Japs. He even joined a Moro 
good-will delegation to Manila and 
paid courtesy calls to puppet lea- 
ders to disguise his real intentions. 

Then sometime in June 1944, 
Ali decided it was time to strike. 
He had won the confidence of the 
Japanese and was entrusted with 
the task of escorting Japanese 
troops repairing the Malaban-Co- 
tobato road. Meanwhile Ali hand- 
picked 21 Moros, the majority 
relatives, to carry out his daring 
plan. 

For three days, Ali observed the 
movements of the Japanese. On 
the fourth day, he gave the signal 
for the attack while the Japs were 
having lunch. Each Moro picked 
a Japanese and slashed their 
heads with the double-edged *kris\ 



After annihilating the Japanese 
group in the road, Ali drove the 
Japanese truck to Fort Corcuera. 
There, he told the Jap troops that 
their captain was waiting for 
them at the boundary of Lanao, 
and to bring picks and shovels. 

While the Japanese were getting 
the tools, Ali rushed to the am- 
munition dump, killed the Jap- 
anese guards with his kris and 
with the help of his 21 men wiped 
out the 44 Japs, including 11 offi- 
cers, in Fort Corcuera. 

Ali took all documents of mili- 
tary value including maps, plans 
and codes, according to Secretary 
Cabili. He also took arms, ammu- 
nition and food supplier. He held 
the fort for 24 hours while he sent 
runners to nearby guerilla units to 
ask reinforcements to fight off 
Japanese coming from Cotobato. 

No reinforcements arrived from 
the guerrillas. Instead Ali re- 
ceived reports that launches carry- 
ing Japanese troops were entering 
the mouth of the Malabang River. 

Ali and his men, although out- 
numbered, lay in ambush at the 
beach. When the Japanese were 
within range, Ali gave the signal 
to fire. The Japanese suffered 
heavy casualties but succeeded in 
deploying, and Ali slowly with- 
drew his men into the forest and 
escaped to the hills. 

Cabili said that Ali was in love 
with an American mestiza named 
Miss McKeehan. He added: "Miss 
McKeehan wrote Ali a congratu- 
latory letter when she heard of

fell in the hands of Ali's rival. 
The jealous lover presented Miss 
McKeehan's letter to the Japanese, 
who immediately arrested her fa- 
mily, including her mother and six 
children. All were killed in cold 
blood." 

Cabili said that Ali is now a 
volunteer in Lanao and constantly 
harassing the enemy in the hills. 
"He is one of Moroland's greatest 
heroes," declared Cabili.

Started as First Aid Station, 
Hospital Has Cared for 1,525 



PCAU No. 4 Public Hospital, at 
T. Earnshaw and Tecson Streets, 
has handled 1,525 cases since Feb. 
5, two days following the entry of 
the American forces into Manila. 

The hospital was started as a 
first aid station by a group of 
civic-spirited individuals with me- 
dical supplies donated by some re- 
sidents of Tondo. Since its estab- 
lishment, the hospital has been 
under the direction of Dr. Vicente 
Ceniza. 

Patients are brought to the hos- 
pital in pushcarts, in jeeps, in 
PCAU ambulance cars and even 
on the shoulders of relatives. 
They come from as far away as 
the south side of the Pasig river 
and from Navotas and Malabon, 
Rizal. 

Since it was placed under the 
supervision of the United States 
Army medical authorities, the 
hospital staff has been enlarged 
to include seven physicians, six 
registered nurses, five , student 
nurses and 16 attendants. In ad- 
dition to medical supplies, the 
PCAU has recently furnished the 
hospital with army cots, blankets, 
food supplies and other necessities.

Japan's Guardian Ghosts' 

Tokyo radio is filling the air with grave warnings on the */rjou8 
imputations for Japan in the loss of Iwo Jima, finally conceaea oy 
the Tokyo warlords a full week after the United States took format 
possession of the island, 

Pre?nier Koiso termed "the loss of Two the moat unfortunate tnmff 
in the whole war situation' 1 as "opporunities for the invasion of our 
homeland unit be greater" 

Domei quoted the defeated Japanese commander on Iwo as saying 
in Mb last message: "The departed souls will forever hover over this 
island, to lead the imperial forces to resume tlhcir offensive toward re- 
capture of the island" 

It is pertinent to ask what have similar Japanese souls hovering 
over Attu f Kiska, the Gilbcrtst Marshalls and countless other points in 
the Pacific war theater been abU to do. Far from mounting an offen- 
sive, the Japanese forces are being driven from an ever widening area | 
of the Philippines, and the Japanese fhet has been severely mauled 
in its home waters of the Inland tea itself.

119 Arrested Here For Price 
Violations In 5 Day Period 



Determined to stamp out profit- 
eering in Manila, the price control 
division of the police department 
made 119 arrests in the five days 
ending yesterday. Most of the ar- 
rests involve prices charged for 
fresh foods, such as fish, chicken, 
eggs and panocha. 

The government-established price 
for fresh fish is 4U centavos a kilo, 
but fish vendors still sell their 
wares at 60 centavos per unit of 
the milkfish variety, which usually 
weighs only 350 grams. 

In the case of chicken, the con- 
trolled price is anywhere between 
25 centavos and 1*1,20 but average- 
Bizcd chickens are bringing not 
less than I'lO. The controlled 
price for eggs is 3 centavos each 
but the profiteer price varies from 
70 centavos to PI. 

The ceiling price of panocha is 
10 centavos a kilo, but the black 
market rate ranges form Pl.20 to 
H.50, depending upon the quality 
and supply. 

According to Maj. H. C. Parker, 
supervising the price control, most 
of the price law cases have been 
disposed of by the courts, with 
those found guilty fined or jailed, 
The fines range from P10 to P100 
and the jail terms are one month 
and a day for the first offense, 

Maj. Parker declared there will 
be no letup in the drive against 
profiteering, and asserted: "It 
matters not whether the markets 
are empty of vendors, provided we 
get the profiteers and stop their 
illegal activities." 

Parker called on the public to 
assist by reporting price violations 
to the authorities, and by refusing 
to buy goods at prices above the 
ceiling charges set by the govern- 
ment. 

He added that he has detailed 
price control operatives in the 
burned areas like Quiapo, Paco 
and San Andres, to curb prof iteers 
who may be driven away from 
markets in north Manila.

Allies Hold 300 Miles 
Along West Bank of Rhine 



Gains were reported in all sec- 
tors of Luzon in today's com 
munique from General MacAr 
thur's headquarters. 

Forward elements of the 33rd 
division crossed the Naguilian river 
to seize Naguilian town and air- 
field, on the road to Baguio. Ele- 
venth corps units pushed into the 
Bosoboso river valley near Mt. 
Quitago and Mt. Tanauan, while 
other elements continued reduc- 
tion of remaining enemy positions 
on the crest of Mt. Baytangan. 

The 158th regimental combat 
team captured the town of Cuen- 
ca, southeast of Lake Taal, and 
cut the Mani road east of the town. 

Air units pounded the Visayan 
islands in the heaviest series of 
strikes made in several weeks. 
Heavv bombers on three succes- 
sive days hit enemy camps and 
supplv areas near Cebu City with 
214 tons, setting off many fires 
and explosions. 

Light naval • units patrolling 
Cebu and Palawan destroyed three 
enemy barges and one : small I cratt 
Rocket firing Navy planes blasted 
a small enemy submarine an- 
chored off Cebu city. 

Air patrols on the China Sea 
"blockade swept enemy shipping 
lanes from the Nansei islands i to

destroying or damaging foul 
enemy vessels of 1,000 tons, eight 
coastal vessels and four landing

First Large Local 
Factory To Reopen 

Uncowed by the destruction of 
most of Manila and the paralysis 
of business in general, the Manila 
Pearl Button Corporation dusted 
its machinery and swept up accu- 
mulated dirt in its factory build- 
ings in Grace Park last week and 
announced that it was open for 
business. 

The plant 'was shut down after 
the Japanese occupied Manila, it 
is the first large private employer 
of labor to resume operations. 

Actually the factory will go 
Mdc into production on Monday, 
when about 600 of the 1,000 pre- 
i« employees will return to work. 



PARIS — Virtually the entire 
west bank of the Rhine for 300 
miles from the southeastern cor- 
ner of Holland to the Swiss border 
was in Allied hands Thursday, as 
the American Third and Seventh 
Armies wrote a triumphant finish 
to the Battle of Outer Germany. 



Only remnants remained to be 
cleaned up in the Saar and Pala- 
tinate districts. The German de- 
feat cost well over 100,000 men — 
88, 135 in prisoners alone. 

The whirlwind American drive 
crushed all but a disorganized 
fraction of two German armies in 
the Saar and Palatinate districts. 

The Third Army mopped up re- 
sistance inside the German chemi- 
cal capital of Ludwigshafen, 
cleared more than 75 percent of 
Mainz, and sped 19 miles north- 



west of Karlsruhe. 

Seventh Army columns advanced 
28 miles north, passing many po- 
sitions captured by the Third 
Army and forming numerous 
junctions. „ 

Above the Saar, U. S. First 
Army forces, jumping off from 
their bridgehead east of the Rhine, 
pushed north to within 12 miles 
of the Ruhr, and 13 miles of Mul- 
heim and Gladbach, east of Co- 
logne. They also seized 14 miles 
of the six-lane speedway leading 
through the Ruhr to Berlin. 

In conjunction with the Amer- 
ican push toward the Ruhr valley, 
1,300 United States heavy bomb- 
ers on Thursday pounded nine of 
the largest army camps in western 
Germany. The assault was fol- 
lowed by a daylight attack by 
nearly 1,000 British bombers. • 



US Congress to Get 
Proof of Jao Cruelty 
In Manila Fight 

WASHINGTON — Brig. Gen. 
Carlos P. Romulo, Philippine resi- 
dent commissioner to the United 
States, will shortly present to Con- 
gress documentary and photogra- 
phic proof of wanton Japanese 
cruelty to helpless civilians. 

Romulo, who returned from Lu- 
zon last week with his wife and 
four sons, told reporters of his 
forthcoming reports on Thursday. 

Describing the final stages of 
the battle for the historic walled 
city, Romulo said: "All the Jap- 
anese marines inside the walled 
city were destined to death. One 
man, Joaquin Gillan, managed to 
leap from the high wall and swim 
the Pasig river with a broken 
back At Santo Tomas hospital he 
told me that the Japanese poured 
kerosene over more than l,uuu 
Filipino men and turned them into 
living torches." 

Romulo introduced to reporters 
his 19-year-old son, Carlos, a ju- 
nior lieutenant in the Philippine 
army. Romulo said bis son had 
killed seven Japanese m battles m 
the Philippines.

Russians Secure 
Flanks For Final 
Berlin Assault 



MOSCOW — Russian shock 
troops broke through German de- 
fenses Thursday south and west 
of Oppeln in southern Silesia, ad- 
vanced 25 miles in the first day, 
and trapped at least 15,000 Ger- 
mans, . Marshal Stalin announced 
Friday night. 

More than 400 German towns 
were overrun in this sector south- 
east of Berlin, in an obvious move 
to secure the left flank of power- 
ful Russian armies now poised for 
a final assault on the German 
capital. 

For the past two months, fol- 
lowing the spectacular 300-mile 
breakthrough from Warsaw to 
within 38 miles of Berlin, Rus- 
sian generals have methodically 
shuttled their forces into position 
along the Oder River line, 
straightening out the dangerous 
central salient. At the northern 
end of the line, Soviet armies 
within the past six days completed 
thefr campaign to clear the east 
bank of the Oder from captured 
Kustrin to the Baltic. 

Far to the rear, Red" Army co- 
lumns polished off the last rem- 
nants of shattered German forces 
penned up inside East Prussia. 



SAN FRANCISCO - A Domei

Rule Goes 
Into Effect 
On April 1st 

Traffic moves to the right hand 
side of the road in Manila, begin- 
ning April 1, the Manila police 
department announced yesterday. 
Putting into effect President Os- 
mena's executive order of March 
10, the new traffic regulation 
affects all moving vehicles in the 
Philippines from the largest army 
truck to carabao carts and care- 
tellas. 

The order reverses the traffic 
habits of the nation, which go 
back at least to the beginning of 
Spanish rule. 

The executive order explained: 
"it is deemed advisable to change 
the existing regulations... so that 
vehicle traffic in the Philippines 
shall conform with the practice of 
driving on the right side of the 
road obtaining in most countries 
of the world." 

President Osmena pointed out 
that the change to standard motor 
vehicles would materially reduce 
the cost of automobiles imported 
from the United States. He also 
said that the present time affords 
the best, opportunity to effect the 
change, since American army ve- 
hicles are built for right hand 
driving and American drivers are 
accustomed to the procedure. 

The* executive order, for the be- 
nefit of Filipinos who have spent 
their lives driving to the left of 
the road, explains traffic proce- 
dure under the new rules: 

Every person driving a motor 
vehicle or guiding an animal- 
drawn vehicle on a highway* shall 
pass to the right when meeting 
persons or vehicles, coming toward 
him, and to the left when overtak- 
ing persons or vehicles going the 
same direction. When turning to 
the left in going from one high- 
way into another, every vehicle 
shall be conducted to the right of 
of the center of the intersection 
of the highway. 

All existing laws inconsistent 
with the new regulations are re- 
pealed by the executive order.^

Prominent Women Now 
Have Work-a-Day Jobs 

A number of college girls and 
members of Manila's "Four Hun- 
dred" who would not have consi- 
dered seriously the idea of work- 
in* for a living in pre-war days 
are now engaged in various occu- 
pations. 

There is, for instance, a svelte, 
youthful alumna of the state uni- 
versity who is now selling food- 
stuffs in an improvised store, 
while a lady lawyer who lost her 
home during the recent conflagra- 
tion is working as clerk for Luzon 
base section. Several girls from 
wealthy Manila families are con- 
nected with PCAU. 

The wife of a former depart- 
ment secretary has a flourishing 
restaurant in Sampaloc, and a 
former city high school teacher is 
giving lessons to small children in 
her neighborhood. Two enterpris- 
ing young women,* both college 
trained and who formerly kept 
house for their parents who died 
during the massacre in the south 
district of Mianila, are busy ga- 
thering equipment for a dress- 
making shop. 

The great majority of the local 
college girls are, however, still in 
search of white collar jobs.

Air Offensive Over 
Reich In 36th Day 

LONDON— Striking before noon 
Wednesday, fleets of Allied planes 
carried out two heavy attacks on 
German targets. 

A force of 2,000 American 
bombers and fighters hit nine air- 
fields in northwestern Germany 
and a tank factory at Plauen, ten 
miles from the Czecholovak bor- 
der. Another large fleet of British 
planes blasted a major oil refinery 
at Bremen. Berlin was bombed 
Wednesday night for the 29th con- 
secutive night. The latest aerial 
assaults extended the most intensi- 
fied air offensive in history to 
35 out of the last 36 days. 

TOKYO— -Tokyo radio reported

Navy Medical Officer Set Up 
Clinic for Bilibid Wounded 



President Sergio Osmeiia pre- 
fers to be addressed as "Mr. Pres- 
ident" instead of the usual "Your 
Excellency" according to a release 
froninhe Department of Informa- 



WASHINGTON— The Navy de- 
partment told Wednesday how a 
Navy medical corps officer orga- 
nized a' staff to care for over 100 
desperately diseased and wounded 
captives in Manila's Bilibid prison. 

Commander K. Bennet Sartim 
took over the task of organizing 
medical treatment of the prisoners, 
of whom 850 undernourished 
Americans survived. He had his 
medical staff in operation May 31, 
1942 but was handicapped by lack 
of medicine, bandages and labora- 
otry equipment. 

Sartim made repeated appeals 
to the Japanese for help until Oct- 
ober 1943, when he was trans- 
ferred to another camp. A Jap- 
anese official is quoted in the 
Navy report as saying: "His bi- 
monthly letters to the high com- 
mand were not in keeping with 
expected cooperation." 

Navy Commander Alan R. Mc- 
Cracken said that Bilibid was the 
best run prison camp in the Phil- 
ippines, but that the Japanese sys- 
tem of mass punishment prevailed 
even there. They divided the pri- 
soners into groups of ten, and if 
one escaped or got out of line in 
the slightest, the other nine would 
be punished. 

He added that the many appeals 
to Japanese officials, based on in- 
ternational law, were met with the 
emphatic reply that Japan was not

the majority of them jitneys and 
trucks, had been registered up to 
yesterday, according to the office 
of the director of traffic of Ma- 
nila police department. 

Capt. M. Joseph Feuchter, dir- 
ector of traffic, stated yesterday

of some 87,000 automobiles and 
trucks registered in 1941. From 
the, beginning of the Japanese oc- 
cupation in 1942 to the last days 
of January, 1945, the Japs com- 
mandered almost every vehicle m 
Manila and the neighboring pro- 
vinces for the transportation of 
war materials or for personal" use, 

Despite the small number of 
motor permits, there are regular 
daily runs by trucks and buses be- 
tween Manila and Nueva EcijaJ 
Pangasinan, Tarlac, Pampanga | 
and Bulacan. The waiting room f 
for the. lines is at the corner of

WASHINGTON— The Japanese 
forces occupying the rich Nether- 
lands East Indies "are becoming 
just about as isolated as in Truk 
or the Solomons/' Under Secre- 
tary of War Robert Patterson tola 
a press conference Thursday. 

He added that Army service 
forces will be maintained in Eu- 
rope after the collapse of German\ 
to salvage as much waf equipment 
as possible for use against the 
Japanese. 



Sfh Air Force S«-ts 
Record for Sinkings 



WASHINGTON— The American 
Fifth Airforce sank more Japanese 
shipping in the Southwest Pacific 
in the first ten days of March 
than in any of the previous eight 
months- In its announcement 
Thursday, the War department 
said that in the ten-day period, the 
Fifth Airforce sank 90,320 tons

tons and damaged 50,790 more 



For the first time since 1941, 
Manila and the rest of the libe- 
rated communities wiU observe 
Palm Sunday tomorrow in the 
traditional manner. The few chur- 
ches in the city which escaped Jap- 
mese demolition are expected to 
ibserve the day with "hosannas" 
md palm offerings to commemo- 
rate the triumphal entry of Christ 
into Jerusalem, 

In the years before the Japanese 
•ccupation, Holy Week beginning 
ritti Palm Sunday was a period 
d deep meditation and prayer. 
Throngs filled the churches of the 
city, especially in Intramuros 
where seven churches and four 
chapels were located. All these are 
in ruins now, but there are 
four or five churches in the city 
which escaped unscathed. The 
most centrally located of them is 
iie Quiapo church, with its fa- 
mous Black Nazarene known the 
ountry over. The many persons 
vho credit the Black Nazarene 
■vvith miraculous powers believe 
that the saint saved the church 
■rom the flames. 

On account of the fire which 
devastated most of Manila, the 
traditional evening processions will 
^ foregone this year. Practically 
til holy images formerly borne in 
the processions were lost with the 
worldly belonging of many faith- 
ful devotees. 

However, the usual church ser- 
vices will be observed as hereto- 
fore. The Lenten season which 
began Feb. 18 will come to a cli- 
max on Easter Sunday, April 1, 
when the church bells will ring out

Army of Filipino Guerrillas 
For Japan Invasion Proposed^ 



. . . EDITORIAL . . . 

Soldiers Wh o Fig ht with Tools 

Every resident of Manila owes a vote of thanks to the United 
States Army Corps of Engineers. rrr * 

Manuel Manosa, superintendent of the Metropolitan Water dis- 
trict, announced this week that water service will be available in every 
section of Manila, including the worst devastated areas south of the 
Pasig river, within a week. This affects every Manilan personally 
and vitally, from the standpoint of health as well as convenience and 
personal comfort. And it is entirely the result of almost superhuman 
efforts by the Army engineers. 

The Japanese did their level best to damage the Manila water 
system beyond the possibility of rapid repair. They blasted mains 
and the bigger valves, and blew out the reservoir. Infiltrating Japs re- 
peatedly killed American guards along pipelines that had been cap- 
tured intact, and dynamited the line. But the engineers were equal 
to their task. They used quick-drying cement to patch up the re- 
servoir wall, and patched old pipelines and laid new ones with amaz- 
ing speed. Within less than two weeks of the Americans 9 return to 
Manila, most of the north section had water service. Now, in less 
than two months, all of the city is to be served. 

Manila has so far escaped an epidemic, and health authorities 
now believe the danger is largely passed. For this, the lion's share 
of credit goes to the Army engineers, the soldiers who fight with tools. 

Incidence of Tuberculosis 
Found High in Manila Area 



Filipinos' Democratic 
ideals Defeated Jap 
"Cultural" Plan Here 



A plan for all guerrill 
mands in the Philippines 
joined, offering Genera] ) 
thur a veteran Filipino am 
wing of the Allied invasion 
to Japan, was proposed y« 
by Manuel Eloriaga, Manila 
rilla leader who was thrice 
- 4.^a Town's I <?nnpd bv the Japs in Ft. Sa 
"The Filipinos resisted Japan s j so ^ a he Dy formatioI1 of such , 



A daily average of 200 persons 
is examined at the tuberculosis 
control section of the Manila 
health department at San Lazaro, 
according to Dr. Sixto A. Francis- 
co, section chief. Of this number, 
50 have been discovered to be suf- 
fering from consumption. 

Dr. Francisco attributed the un- 
usually high percentage of TB suf- 
ferers in Manila to a number of 
causes growing out of the war and 
the Jap occupation. They included 
acute malnutrition for a protrac- 
ted period, lack of institutional 
care, overcrowding in homes, 
continuous worry and fear, com- 
plete lack of diagnosis and treat- 
ment for several weeks after con- 
ditions in Manila became chaotic, 
and the influx of infected persons 
from nearby provinces seeking 
treatment in the city. 

A comparatively small number 
of patients is admitted for con- 
finement in San Lazaro due to 
lack of facilities, said Dr. Cesar 
Ongpin, senior tuberculosis specia- 
list of the section. There are only 
two wards, which are designed to 
accommodate not more than 200 
patients. 

Scores of TB victims seeking en- 
trance every day must be refused 
for lack of room. Last week there 
were 138 patients under confine- 
ment. The number rose to 220 
this week. A total of 2,690 per- 
sons were examined and 480 
treated for a period of 11 days 
this month. 

Manilans suffering from tuber- 
culosis can go only to San Lazaro 
due to the destruction of the San 
Juan de Dios hospital— formerly 
the Quezon Institute — in the 
Walled City. Furthermore there 
are comparatively few private 
physicians at present engaged m 
the treatment of tuberculosis be- 
cause most TB clinics in Manila 
were either burned or looted. 



Before the liberation of Manila, 
TB patients at San Lazaro were 
starving, according to Dr. Salvador 
Bonoan, staff physician. From 
last November to January,* they 
subsisted on kamoteng kahoy and 
panocha. A number died during 
the last few weeks prior to the li- 
beration of the city, as the Japs re- 
fused to allot them sufficient nou- 
rishing food. 

At present the tuberculosis con- 
trol section of the health depart- 
ment is staffed by only seven phy- 
sicians, six nurses, and two tech* 
nicians. The ^section is under the 
direction of Col. Maurice C. Pin- 
coffs of the U. S. Army, who is at 
the same time director of the 
health department. 



Memorial Services 
For Guerrilla Leader 



Memorial services in honor of 
the late Liberato Bunuan, youth- 
ful guerrilla leader of the Ramsey 
guerrillas who was shot by Japs 
arid Makapilis in La Mesa barrio, 
Rizal province, before the Amer- 
ican forces entered Manila, will 
be held at the United church of 
Manila on Calle Lepanto on April 
1 at 3 p. m. 

Twice captured by the Japanese 
military police for guerrilla acti- 
vities, Bunuan managed to gain 
his freedom each time from Fort 
Santiago. A lieutenant in the Phil- 
ippine Army stationed in Minda- 
nao when the war broke out he 
was sent to Damortis, La Union 
and engaged the first Japanese 
invasion forces. He was taken 
prisoner there but escaped. 

Joining the Ramsey guerrillas, 
he became the chief of the propa- 
ganda unit, printed the "Voice of

cultural invasion because our 
ideals and principles coincide 
with the principles and ideals oi 
the United States," Secretary Max- 
imo Kalaw declared in a radio- 
cast yesterday noon over the 
Commonwealth Hour, 

Kalaw said that a review of 
Philippine history will show that 
the seeds of democracy were 
planted in the islands even before 
the coming of the Spaniards. 

"As a matter of fact," said Ka- 
law, "the Philippines was the first 
nation in the Far East to advo- 
cate the principle of sovereignty 
of the people, in the famous Ma- 
iolos Constitution adopted in 
1898." 

Kalaw quoted the words of 
Apolinario Mabini, brains of the 
Philippine Revolution: "Thou 
shalt not recognize in thy country 
the authority of any person who 
has not been elected by thee and 
thy countrymen; thou shalt strive 
for a republic and never for a 
monarchy in thy country." 



All applications to engage in 
business in the public markets 
must be handed in before 4 p. m. 
March 25, the Commonwealth 
emergency control administration 
announced yesterday. The admin- 
istration has a representative in 
every public market, with whom 
che application may be filed. 

A lottery for the lease of stalls 
in the public markets will be held 
from March 27 to 29 in all the 
public markets. 



bined guerrilla army is an <

Lt. Col. Agustin Patricio, 
mander of the Tampa sect

fied his intention to adhei 
such an undertaking, stating 
"our men are one in this j

Such offer of a strong Filipi 
force to fight side by side w 
theoAllied forces, would not be 
first of its kind. In 1918,

the Philippine National Gu 
and offered the United State

Congress to Study 
Use of Seized Isles 

HONOLULU — A congressional in- 
quiry will be held within a month 
on the eventual disposition of former 
Japanese islands seized by United 
States forces, a House of Represen- 
tatives naval affairs subcommittee 
announced here Saturday. The com- 
mittee has not yet taken a stand 
either for or against American con- 
trol of islands such as Iwo Jima. 
The tremendous cost we have paid 
in lives and materials for those is- 
lands we have taken by invasion will 
not be overlooked," a spokesman for 
the committee stated. 



30,000 Airborne Troops 
Land Behind Enemy Lines 

PARIS — Three Allied ground and one airborne armies have crossed the 
Lower Rhine river, Allied headquarters announced yesterday. The crossing 
were made along a 125-mile front north of the Ruhr, in what is described 
as the greatest Allied attack against Germany since the Normandy landings 
last June. 

The ground forces were elements of the American Ninth, the British Sec- 
ond, and the Canadian First armies, which crossed the river and entered 
the towns of Wesel and Rees on the east bank. They also captured Bislich, 
penetrating at least four miles. 
At the same time, the Allied First 



Airborne army dropped into the flat 
land north of the Ruhr. At least 30,000 
paratroops and glider-borne infantry 
assaulted the German lines, knocking 



U. S. Navy Continues to Hit 
Jap Home, Outer Defense 



GUAM— The U. S. Fifth fleet car 
rier force that crippled 17 Japanese 
warships in Japan's Inland 8ea last 
Monday continued to destroy home- 
based enemy aircraft throughout the 
week and carried the attack to the 
Ryukyu islands south of Japan, ac- 
cording to yesterday's Navy commun- 
ique. 

In spite of bad weather, the Amer- 
ican force struck Friday and Satur- 
day at aircraft, shipping, airdromes 
and other installations in the Ryukyus 
Carrier aircraft destroyed enemy 
shipping and damaged numerous 
small craft. At the same time fast 
battleships pounded coastal objectives 
with their big guns. ' 

Tuesday and Wednesday, Hellcat 
and Corsair fighter planes took off 
from the carriers still ranging off 
the coast of Japan to destroy large 
numbers of enemy planes based on 
Kyushu, Shikoku and Honshu. The 
anti-aircraft gunners on the Amer- 
ican warships also took their toll of 
Japanese planes. Wednesday after- 



noon, approximately fifty enemy air- 
craft were shot down in one encoun- 
ter with a loss of three American 
planes. One United States destroyer 
was seriously damaged and a larger 
unit suffered minor damage in this 
battle. 

Saturday's attack on the Ryukyus 
extended to a full week the carrier as- 
sault that began March 18 with an 
aerial bombardment of Kyushu, in 
which heavy -damage was done to 
Omura, one of the chief operational 
posts guarding the Japanese naval 
base of Sasebo. Other targets were 
Kanoye an important air station; the 
Saeki naval base and the important 
town of Kagoshima. 

The continued blows of the Amer- 
ican fleet belie Japanese claims made 
Thursday that the task force had 
been dealt "a crushing blow." On 
the same day the Japanese communi- 
que added "one battleship heavily 
damaged" to previous claims that 
ranged from 11 to 16 warship sunk 
or damaged. 



McNutt Suggests Postponement 
of Complete P. J. Independence 



WASHINGTON — The suggestion 
that Philippine independence be de- 
ferred at least until after the Com- 
monwealth has been rehabilitated 
from the ravages of war was made 
by Paul V. McNutt, former Philip- 
pines high commissioner, in an inter- 
view Friday. McNutt spoke unoffi- 
cially. 

"If the Filipinos defer the ques- 
tion of independence, they are more 
likely to get a sympathetic reaction 
from Congress on rehabilitation mea- 
gre*." McNutt points out "If th« 



Philippines step off into an unchar- 
ted sea, as some of their leaders 
seem to be advocating, the islands 
are clearly destined for trouble. We 
may have to let the Philippines take 
their freedom now and learn the 
hard way." 

McNutt also warned that "it is 
more than possible that if they get 
their freedom now, they may never 
again attain their pre-war economic 
stability and may destine themselves 
to a permanently lowered standard 

r>f HviJlflf." 



out gun positions and communications 
from the rear. 

The attack opened at nine o'clock 
Friday night when the preliminary 
crossings were made. The main forces 
of American, British, and Canadian 
armor and infantry were shepherded 
across by veteran amphibious assault 
teams of the United States and Bri- 
tish navies in hundreds of invasion 
craft, which were secretly massed on 
the west bank of the Rhine. 

A 65-mile smoke screen covered the 
operation, creating perhaps the great- 
est artificial fog ever produced. Ini- 
tial opposition to the attack was 
light, and it was some hours after 
the first British shock troops crossed 
the river that the Germans began 
shelling the pontoon bridges. 

A spokesman at Allied headquar- 
ters said that the Germans' main re- 
serves had not yet entered the battle, 
but that the tremendous Allied aerial 
bombardment of the past three days 
has crippleH the enemy's main com- 
munication lines. 

In the meantime, British Field 
Marshal Montgomery, commander of 
ground armies, was rushing armored 
columns through the bridgeheads in 
great strength. Long lines of tanks 
and armored troop carriers tolled 
in the wake of the trail-blazing in- 
fantrymen. 

This latest crossing placed six Al- 
lied armies east of the Rhine, with 
three additional armies in reserve on 
the west bank. 

Sixty miles south of the new cross- 
ing, the American First army was 
crowding up against the southern 
bank of the Ruhr from its expanding 
bridgehead east of the Rhine. Nine- 
ty miles south of the First, the Amer- 
ican Third army was rapidly expand- 
ing its bridgehead on the east bank of 
the Rhine between Mainz and Worms, 
which was gained in a surprise gross- 
ing Friday without preliminary artil- 
lery preparation. General Patton'a 
tank columns were about 265 miles 
from Berlin. 

Still weBt of the Rhine in reserve 
are the American Seventh army 
which is clearing up the Palatinate; 
the French First army in the same 
area and, along the upper R^e, 
the newly formed American Fif-

ARMY AIRFORCES H.Q. — The 
general depot of the Army Airforces 
in the Pacific ocean areas is only 
four months old,* but it already is

rushing needed spare parts. There 
are some 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 air- 
craft parts stored around the 1,000- 
foot air strip, and when construc f un 
catches up there will be at leaSt 
1,000,000 square feet of warehouses. 

As an example of how well this de- 
pot somewhere in the Pacific is doing 
its job, Col. Oscar F. Carlson, com- 
manding officer, said Friday that in 
recent months the average of all 
types of planes grounded in the en- 
tire theater through lack of parts 
has been only 3.5 per cent.

-ligher Ceilings 
Jrged for City 
3y Price Chief 

An increase in Manila price ceil- 
igs is urged by the price control di- 
ision of the Manila police depart- 
lent. In a letter sent to Malacanan, 
ose C. de Vega, chief of the price 
ontrol division, declared that the le- 
al price of several items needs revi- 
ion upward. 

Vega stressed, however, that until 
mcreases are ordered by presidential 
ction or by the secretary of interior, 
is office will enforce the law to the 
mit. 

During the seven-day period end- 
rig March 25, around 200 arrests 
rere made by the price control 
ivision. The city fiscal's office, 
rtiich prosecutes price control law 
iolations, likewise favors an upward 
evision of some prices in Manila. 
)ity Fiscal Al'ejo Mabanag recom- 
lended such action in a letter to the 
epartment of justice. Higher price 
eilings are sought only in the city 
f Manila, with present schedules re- 
amed in liberated areas of the prov- 
inces. 

First Assistant Fiscal G. S. Nar- 
asa outlined the following proposed 
rice changes: 

Present Proposed 
ananas .... .01 each .02 to .05 apiece 

.ice 32 a ganta .50 

ish 40 a kilo 1.00

teat 80 a kilo 1.50 

hicken 25 to 1.20 1.00 to 5.00 

ggs \. .03 .10 each 

Narvasa pointed out that living 
osts in Manila are higher than in 
he provinces, and that the city's 
ood supply is below normal due to 
estruction of crops and limited 
ransportation facilities. He added 
hat if it were not for PCAU, Ma- 
ila residents would be in difficult 
traits.

Allies Smash Past Rhine 

To Within 10 Miles of Essen 



PARIS — Allied armies slashed for- 
ward swiftly Sunday along the entire 
length of Germany's western front 
despite stiffening German resistance. 
At least two armies, the American 
Ninth and Third, made decisive break- 
throughs. The Ninth was one of 
the four armies that previously had 
crossed the Rhine in a combined army 
and navy operation unique in mili- 
tary history. 

The 30th division of the Ninth army 
broke clear through the German lines 
in an eight-mile smash beyond the 
Rhine, and was reported "out in the 
open" in the northern Ruhr. The 
30th's surge carried it ahead of all 
other advances in the 21st army group 
and brought it within ten miles of Es- 
sen, industrial heart of the Ruhr. 

Simultaneously, Third Army tanks 
tore loose in a 27-mile dash from the 
Rhine bridgehead between Mainz and 
Worms and captured intact a bridge 
across the Main river, one of the 
major barriers to the American ad- 
vance. This breakthrough of the Ger- 
man lines carried the Fourth Armor- 
ed division 40 miles beyond the Rhine. 

Meanwhile, other Third army units 
crossed the Rhine at several points 
between Coblenz and Boppard and 
were reported within 11 miles o.f the 
First army's bridgehead at Remagen, 
where the initial crossing of the Rhine 
was effected. First army troops 



magen bridgehead to a point 13 miles 
east of the Rhine. The lunge caught 
the enemy as they were preparing to 
launch a major counter-attack. 

At the northern end of the front, 
the British Second army welded its 
30-mile bridgehead across the Rhine 
with the capture of Wesel, and drove 
eight miles forward on the north Ger- 
man plain. The British in this push 
crossed six bridges spanning the Is- 
sel river which had been captured by 
paratroopers of the First Airborne 
army. 

Elements of the Canadian First 
army were 12 miles or more west of 
Wesel and battling beyond the Ger- 
man strong point of Rees, half of 
which was in Allied hands. German 
paratroopers entrenched at the north- 
ern flank of the bridgehead put up 
tough resistance at Rees. 

At the southern end of the front, 
the American Seventh army advanced 
all along its front to the Rhine, li- 
quidating the last German stands west 
of the river. 



14,853 Dead 
Counted in 
Past 10 Days 

Japanese forces in the Philippines 
have lost over 296,000 troops in killed 
and wounded since American forces 
landed last October, General MacAr- 
thur revealed this morning. Since 
March 16, when enemy casualties 
were reported as approximately 
282,000, an additional 14,853 Jap- 
anese dead have been counted and 
171 more prisoners taken in opera- 
tions in the Philippines. 

Sixth division units fighting east 
of Manila overran a fortified area of 
caves and dugouts, inflicting heavy 
losses on the enemy, General Mac- 
Arthur's Monday communique re- 
ported. Large quantities of supplies, 
arms and ammunition were captured. 
Elements of the 43rd division cap- 
tured two mountains in the upper 
end of the Marikina watershed and 
continued combing the upper Boso- 
boso river valley. 

I Corps units repulsed six enemy 
counter-attacks as the Japanese at- 
tempted to stop the American ad- 
vance into Balete pass in the north- 
ern hills of Luzon. 

The First Cavalry was reported 
back in action in Batangas province 
where a drive was underway along 
the main highway to the south. 

Far East airforce units carried 
out heavy attacks on enemy coastal 
defenses and supply dumps along the 
Luzon east coast and north across 
Balete pass into Cagayan valley. 
Heavies hit installations near Cebu 
city, in the Visayas, with 210 tons of 
bombs, destroying many installations" 
and touching off large fires and ex- 
plosions. 

Heavy bombers with fighter escort 
continued the heavy pounding of For- 
mosa, dumping 145 tons of 2,000 
pound bombs on the Jigsutgetsu hy- 
droelectric system, main source of 
power for the island's industrial 
areas. The power plants and trans- 
formers were wrecked and water 
poured from broken penstocks. 

Patrol planes of the China Sea 
blockade sank a 3,000 ton freighter- 
transport, four freighters each un- 
der 1,000 tons, and damaged two 
other small freighters and a destroy- 
er escort.

Superforts Smash 
Nagoya With High 
Explosive Bombs 

WASHINGTON — A large force 
of Super-Fortresses on Saturday 
pounded Nagoya with high explo- 
sives, in the third attack on that 
Japanese aircraft center since March 
12. 

It was the sixth assault by great 
fleets of the Marianas-based B-29s 
since March 10 on Japan's industrial 
cities, and the fifth time that the big 
Mitsubishi plane plant has been the 
target of Superforts. 20th Air Force 
headquarters announced Saturday 
that approximately 250 B-29s swept 
in over Nagoya at the unprecedented- 
ly low level of 5,000 feet to deliver 
their load of destruction. 

The opening attack of the aerial 
assault March 10 on Tokyo knocked 
out at least 20 per cent of the city's 
industrial production for three 
months and five per cent for a full 
year, according to Brig. Gen. Lauris 
Norstad, chief of staff of the 20th 
Airforce. 

Norstad also told a news confe- 
rence that the fire attack destroyed 
an estimated 3,000 plants, including 
45 large factories and shattered 200,- 
000 to 250,000 buildings. He estimat- 
ed that 1,200,000 factory workers 
have been left homeless. 

He added that 170 Super-Fortresses 
have been lost since the start of 
operations last June 15. Of these 84 
were lost in combat and 86 as the 
result of operational accidents. 



Japan Fears Invasion 

SAN FRANCISCO— Tokyo foresees 
the possibility of Japan becoming a 
battleground "whereby the homeland 
will be split apart" according to a 
Japanese broadcast heard here Tues- 
day. 



"Philippine Hour 
Goes On Air From 
Studio In Manila 

The Philippine Hour, for the past 
eleven months General MacArthur's 
official information broadcast to the 
Philippines, moves to Manila today. 
The program will be broadcast daily 
at 6 p.m. on 9295 kilocycles. 

The Philippine Hour was inaugurat- 
ed in Sydney, Australia, last May 1 
and moved to Brisbane on June 15th 
to become General MacArthur's offi- 
cial voice. Employing a powerful 
50,000 watt Australian transmitter, 
the Philippine Hour broadcast a daily 
account of world news. Commenta- 
ries on current affairs and words of 
encouragement were broadcast by 
Frederic S. Marquardt and James G. 
Wingo, two former Manila newspa- 
permen who knew the Philippines, 
and whose first interest was the li- 
beration of the country they loved. 

With MacArthur's return to the 
Philippines on October 20th, the Voice 
of Freedom returned to the air to 
supplement the information program, 
moving forward with MacArthur as 
his campaign of liberation unfolded. 
The Voice of Freedom has been 
broadcast from Luzon since the U. S. 
landing, and from Manila for the 
past six weeks. 

General MacArthur has approved 
far-reaching plan of information 
broadcasting employing several {50,- 
000 watt transmitters in the Philip- 
pines, with the expectation that the 
people will be given an opporunity 
to enjoy greater information and edu- 
cation opportunities than radio has 
ever before been able to give them. 

The Philippine Hour will be heard 
daily from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. on 9295 
kilocycles. The Voice of Freedom will 
continue at 12:30 noon on 18,600 kilo- 
cycles.

3 — Weeks Bombing 
of Reich Averages 
274 Tons an Hour 

LONDON — The three weeks of 
continuous day and night bombing 
of Germany at the rate of 274 tons 
of explosives an hour is spreading 
chaos throughout the Reich in pre- 
paration for the knockout blow by 
ground forces. 

A press dispatch points out that 
in three weeks Allied bombers have 
hit Germany with more than twice 
the tonnage of bombs dropped on 
England since the start of the war. 
In the ten days ending Friday, this 
greatest air blitz has systematically 
isolated the industrial Ruhr Valley 
and the rolling Rhineland from the 
rest of Germany. 

The number of planes carrying out 
the terrific bombardment dwarfs the 
then one-day record of 600 aircraft 
Germany sent over London back in 
1940. Today, wi;th fleets of 7,000 
or 8,000 Allied planes aloft, 500 air- 
craft hardly constitute a good sized 
escort force. 

Since the first of March, the Allies 
nave sent an average of 4,000 planes 

92 000 individual flights. Of this to-

urrents running at right angles to 
heir boats. 

In order to carry tanks, bulldozers 
tnd mobile units across the Rhine, 
he crews had to learn how to launch 
anding craft weighing up to 26 tons

1,700 Burned Alive 
In Rape of Manila, 
Declares Romulo 

NEW YORK— The Japanese mili- 
tary stand indicted in the eyes of the 
world for the rape of Manila, Brig. 
Gen. Carlos P. Romulo declared Sun- 
day night over an American nation- 
wide radio program. 

He spoke of having seen the bodies 
of 1,700 civilians who had been burn- 
ed to death by the Japanese. 

Romulo, Philippine resident com- 
missioner, who recently returned 
from Manila, said: "I saw the im- 
perial Japanese marines carrying out 
their orders to destroy Manila and 
murder as many of my countrymen 
as they could. The>* wantonly ma- 
chine-gunned the people and bayo- 
neted and burned others. 

"When the wife of my old friend, 
Senator Elpidio Quirino, tried to 
leave her home, she was machine- 
gunned. When her 15-year-old daugh- 
ter Norma rushed to her side, the 
young girl was brutally shot in the 
head. Then as a final piece of bru- 
tality, the Japanese shot and killed 
Mrs. Quirino's son. 

"I have returned to the United 
States to tell the American Congress 
and the people of this country of the

Nagoya Aircraft Plant 
Hit in Super fort Attack 

WASHINGTON — The Mitsubishi 
aircraft engine plant and other in- 
dustrial targets were hit in Satur- 
day's pre-dawn low-level B-29 attack 
on Nagoya, according to a report 
Sunday from the 20th Air Force 
headquarters. Super-Fortress crew- 
men saw fires and explosions started 
at the target. They said fighter op- 
position and anti-aircraft fire were 
generally moderate. Three B-29s 
were lost. 



Vast Forces to be Moved to 
Pacific When Germany Falls 



WASHINGTON— Top commanders 
of the Army and Navy want the 
American people to know that the de- 
feat of Germany, about which they 
are not making guesses as to date, 
will mark the beginning of a new 
phase in the war against Japan, New 
York Times correspondent Bert An- 
drews wrote on Friday. This phase 
will see the transfer of men and ma- 
terials to the Pacific on a scale that 
staggers the imagination, Andrews 
added "These commanders would like 
the people to gain a thorough under- 
standing of the following facts, 
many soliders now fighting m bu- 
™opewill be switched to the Pacific 
as fast as it is humanly possible to 
set them there. The great stores of 
frms and equipment left over when 
Germany falls will be shuttled to the 
Asiatic theater. AH the men and 
^ of the Navy will be thrown into 
the war against Japan. 

Admiral, King, commander-in-chief 



forces are required to prosecute the 
war in the Pacific. It is the intention 
to shift to the Pacific all naval power 
now devoted to the war in Europe 
and in the Atlantic as soon as pos- 
sible. 

The Army's problem is more com- 
plex. Lieutenant General Brehon B. 
Sommervell, chief of army service 
forces, said, "V-E (Victory in Eu- 
rope) Day v/ill mean the beginning 
of a new job. I hope the people un- 
derstand just what a job it will be." 

Some idea of the vastness of the 
problem of shifting the large army 
forces from Europe to the Pacific is 
<riven by the shipping requirements 
for such a move. America will need 
more ships, said Andrew. All the # li- 
berated countries will be clamoring 
for shipping to bring in food sup- 
plies. Neutral countries will want 
shipping to enable them to resume 
normal trade. Shipping will also be 
required to repatriate German priS-

City Must Save Power 
As Only 3% Is Restored 

So far only 1,200 kilowatts of po- 
wer or 3 per cent have been restored 
out of Manila's normal 40,000 kilowatt 
production capacity, a spokesman for 
the Manila Electric company warned 
yesterday. He added that this figure 
does not include power generated by 
separate American Army units, but 
warned that unless electricity is con- 
served, some organizations now using 
municipal power will be cut off.

THE WAB WILL MOVE FASTER 

The war against Germany is obviously in its final phase. Allied mi- 
litary commanders are not making overly optimistic predictions as to just 
how much longer the Nazis can hold on, tuiving learned a Usson from the 
over-confidence of last autumn. But the European phase of the war has 
progressed to the point where definite plans must be made for the transfer 
of all possible United Nations power from Europe to the Pacific when Ger- 
many's collapse does free them for other assignment. 

The scope of those plans is so great that it is no longer possible, nor ne- 
cessary, to keep the over-all strategy involved a secret. Both British and 
American ; sources in the past week have disclosed the nature of the plans 
in some detail. They call for the swiftest possible shifting of all forces 
that can be transported, to begin the day organized German resistance ends. 
They call for the maintenance of British and American armed strength at 
their present peaks, except in specialized units for which there may be no 
need against Japan. 

To the peoples of Asia, these plans are of vital importance. Every day 
by which victory in Europe can be speeded, means one less day of war to 
destroy the militarism of Japan. While cheering the present spectacular 
progress of the forces of General Mac Arthur, and the commanders of other 
Allied forces fighting Japan, there is reason for Filipinos to applaud the 
heroic efforts United Nations troops are now making in Europe.

Ulied Infantry, Paratroops 
fook Rhine Under Heavy Fire 



SOMEWHERE IN GERMANY— 
An American correspondent, writ- 
ing of the breakthrough across the 
Rhine, says that "elements of the 
three ground armies made amazing 
progress after crossing the Rhine by 
a combination of skill and guts." He 
added: "Everything the Allies have 
learned in three years of war has 
been thrown into this battle against 
the most powerful German fighting 
forces left on the Western Front." 

The correspondent listed a few of 
the factors that made possible the 
success of the Allied crossing. One 
was the calm courage of the British 
commandos who lay within 1,500 
yards of the town of Wesel which 
was flattened in fifteen minutes by 
300 Lancasters. The commandos 
rushed into the flaming rubble and 
crushed the resistance of tough Ger- 
man paratroopers within the city. 

American transport pilots flew 
their cumbersome ships with heavy 
gliders in tow into a storm of anti-

In Interior Department 

Jacob Rosenthal has been appointed 
a technical adviser in the department 
of interior, "with compensation at

The appointment was based on Ro- 
senthal's "long residence in the Phil- 
ippines, intimate knowledge of the Fi- 
lipino people and the service render- 
ed to our country in various capaci- 
ties," according .to Secretary of Inte-

CAVITE IS CAPITAL AGAIN 

The seat of the Cavite provincial

Imus to Cavite City last week, im-

of airborne troops. Sometimes they 
came back across the Rhine in flames, 
sometimes they did not return. 

A heavy pall of smoke hung over 
the entire Ruhr and Rhine from Dus- 
seldorf to Arnheim. Some of it was 
the result of the Allied smoke screen, 
but most of it was due to flaming 
buildings and the impact of thou- 
sands of American and British bom- 
bers and fighters. 

There was little movement behind 
the front late in the preceeding day as 
the Ninth and British Second armies 
lay quiet. However, with darkness 
the front stirred to life as tanks and 
trucks rumbled out of the forest, and 
long convoys came out like magic on 
the roads. The road convoys carried 
loads of every conceivable type of 
weapons, thousands of tons of bridg- 
ing material, and huge landing craft.

sortment of equipment could get un-

PARIS — The surging drives of the 
nerican First and Third armies 
st of the Rhine threaten to split 
I German armies remaining in the 
Bst, front-line dispatches said last 
ght, as the U. S. Seventh army 
ossed the Rhine without opposition 
^ive Gen. Eisenhower seven armies 
st of the river. 

The Third army was 136 miles in- 
de Germany, and the First about 

'a tank column of the powerful 
irst broke 22 miles east through the 
srman lines and smashed into Lim 
lrg, 32 miles northwest of where 
ie Third army was battling in 
rankfurt-on-Main. Limburg, 255 
iles southweest of Berlin, was being 
ipidl'y cleared. 

An American correspondent re 
>rted that the whole western front 
exploding into what might become 
pell-mell race for Berlin, with the 
mcrican and British forces in the 
Drth driving 15 to 17 miles beyond 
ie Rhine a'gainst bewildered resist- 
nce, and by-passing the great ar 
jnal city Essen. 

A field dispatch reported "'there is 
3 solid line in front of the First 
rmy now." 

Gen. Patton's armor-heavy U. S 
hird army entered the southern 
action of Frankfurt, Germany's 
[nth-largest city with a peace-time 
opulation of 546,000, and the U. S,

Carrier Planes, Battleships 
Pound Okinawa in Ryukvus 



GUAM — Carrier aircraft and the big guns of battleships of the Amer- 
ican Pacific fleet combined to pound Okinawa in the Ryukyus islands yes- 
terday. The Navy fliers attacked airfields and other installations on the 

-^island only 380 miles southwest of 
Kyushu, southernmost of the J ap- 
anese home slands, while the battle- 
wagons poured 16-inch shells into 
shore defenses. 

Six enemy planes were destroyed 
out of a small group of Japanese air- 
craft that attacked the American 
force. One of our light units suf- 
fered some damage. 

Admiral Chester W. Nimitz also 
disclosed that carrier fliers destroy- 
ed an eight-ship enemy convoy Satur- 
day west of Amami in the Ryukyu 
group and within 500 miles of the 
China coast. On the same day, Amer- 
ican battleships bombarded Minami 
Dalto, to the southeast. 

Meanwhile Army bombers and fight- 
ers hit the airfield on Chichi Jima 
in the Bonins, GOO miles east of the 
Ryukyus. Black Widow night fighters 
broke up an enemy foray against Iwo 
Jima Monday night, destroying a 
number of Japanese bombers. None 
of the attacking planes reached the 
island. i

SAN FRANCISCO — A Tokyo 
radio broadcast monitored here 
Monday said that American troops 
were storming several islands- in 
the Okinawa portion of the Ryuk- 
yus, 380 miles southeast of Japan. 

On Saturday, a Japanese 
broadcast to Europe said "recent 
operations of the enemy task force 
do not indicate an attempt to make 
new landings." 



Square Miles Burned 
In 2 Nagoya Fire Raids 

GUAM — Five square miles of the 
industrial heart of Nagoya, or 11.6 
per cent of the city, was burned out 
in the two recent B-29 incendiary 
attacks, according to photographs 
brought back by reconnaissance 
planes. The pictures also show that 
six war industries were hit in Sun- 
day's assault by the Super-Fortresses. 

The wrecked industries included 
the Mitsubishi aircraft engine plant, 
Kurena textile factory and Mitsubishi 
Electric company. 



MARINE VETERANS RETURN 

SAN FRANCISCO — Battle-torn

U. S. Marines have arrived here from

they had ever, seen. 



Malacanan Officers Oppose 
McNutt on Independence Delay 



"More than ever our clamor for 
independence should be intensified, ,, 
"Congressman Eugenio Perez of 
Pangasinan commented yesterday af- 
ter reading former High Commis- 
sioner Paul V. McNutt's unofficial 
suggestion that Philippine indepen- 
dence be deferred. 

"We are aware of the difficulties 
we shall encounter with independence, 
but we are sure that the masses of 
our people are ready to face the res- 
ponsibilities that shall come with 
freedom," Congressman Perez said. 

Perez was chairman of the com- 
mittee of appropriations in the for- 
mer National Assembly. 

Senator Eulogio Rodriguez, vete- 
ran politician from Rizal, said that he 
would rather not comment on Mc- 
Nutt's proposal since President Ser- 
gio Osmena is now in the United 
States. "However, Roosevelt and 
Congress are committed to the grant 



Rodriguez pointed out that Pres- 
ident Osmena, at the historic restora- 
tion of the Commonwealth in Manila, 
declared that President Roosevelt 
gave his word that when normal con- 
ditions have returned to the Philip- 
pines, the request for the advance- 
ment of the date of independence will 
be granted. Rodriguez said that Pres- 
ident Osmena hoped independence 
would be granted on August 13, 1945, 
the 47th anniversary of America's 
occupation of the islands. 

"It is true that we have many 
problems to solve in this critical 
period," Rodriguez continued, "but 
with the generosity and altruism of 
America, we hope that we shall re- 
ceive help for the reconstruction and 
rehabilitation of our country." 

Rodriguez was secretary of agri- 
culture and commerce during Pres- 
ident Quezon's term and senator for 
Rizal for several terms. He was im- 
prisoned by the Japanese in Fort 



American Eighth army troops land- 
ed on the eastern coast of Cebu on 
Monday, Gen. MacArthur announced 
this morning. 

The Americal division swarmed 
ashore in assault craft at Talisay, 
five miles southwest of Cebu city, in 
a surprise action which followed a 
violent naval and air bombardment. 
The troops puslied ahead through mo- 
derate opposition, and drove to within 
a mile and a half of the town. The 
pioye placed Gen. MacArthur's forces 
on both sides of the Camotes sea, 
making the position of enemy garri- 
son units on Bohol even more hope- 
less. 

Lt. Gen. Robert L. Eichelberger's 
U. S. Eighth srmy now has important 
elements fighting on seven major 
Philippine islands. On Luzon tney 
are driving the Japanese southward 
on Batangas*peninsula, while Lt. Gen. 
Walter Kreuger's powerful Sixth 
army is engaging what remains of 
Gen. Yamashita's once-numerous Lu- 
zon force in other sectors. In the 
Visayas, the Eighth is maintaining 
heavy pressure on gradually disinte- 
grating garrisons on Palawan and 
Panay, and is cleaning up stragglers 
on Mindoro and Leyte. On Minda- 
nao its troops are hammering the 
Japanese in the Zamboanga sector, 
after establishing strong positions en- 
tirely across the peninsula. 

General MacArthur's earlier com- 
munique reported continued advances 
in all Luzon sectors. Fourteenth 
Corps units pressed forward to the 
east and south in Batangas province. 
Eleventh Corps troops continued the 
cleanup of enemy strongpoints in the 
Marikina watershed, east of Manila. 
I Corps units moved ahead into the 
Balete pass area in the northern 
hills. 

Heavy and medium bombers hit 
coast defenses and communications at 
Legaspi with over 200 tons of bombs. 
Air patrols set fires at Aparri air- 
field in the north, and wrecked enemy 
supply dumps and gun emplacements 
at Baguio and Santa Fe. 

Escorted heavy bombers again 
struck Formosa, - wrecking water- 
front and rail installations at Kee- 
lung and setting fires at Takao.

Stripping Japan 
Of AH Conquests 
is Aim of Allies 

WASHINGTON— Po^t-war plans of 
-rte United Nations, including strip- 
>iti£ Japan of every bit of territory 
*he has taken by force of arms since 
<he started on the warpath back an 
he ISOO's were outlined Saturday by 
Vmcrican foreign affairs experts. 

Taking: part in a State department 
nation-wide broadcast on "Building 
the Peace" were Archibald McLeish, 
assistant secretary of state in charge 
jf cultural relations; James C. Dunn, 
assistant secretary of state in charge 
jf European, Near Eastern and Far 
Eastern affairs, and Robert Murphy, 
political adviser on German affairs 
co the Allied high command in Europe. 

Referring to the 194 J Cairo con- 
ference of Roosevelt, Churchill and 
Chiang Kai-shek, MacLeish said J 
'Formosa and Manchuria will be res- 
ted to China and the Koreans will 
£et their independence in due course;" 
Be explained that this phrase in the 
Cairo agreement "presumably means 
as soon as they are in a position to 
govern themselves." 

Dunn pointed out: "As Under Sec- 
retary of State Joseph C. Grew has 
*aid, there can be no peace anywhere 
m the world until the Japanese as 
we\l as the Nazi enemy are riddled." 

Earlier in the radio discussion, 
MacLeish had pointed out: "It is not 
our purpose to destroy the people of 
Germany, but only the Germans who 
nave misgoverned, mismanaged and 
nisled them, That means that we 
propose to punish and really to 
punish — the guilty war leaders, their 
-ools and their agents."

nue, documentary and postage stamps

|J Life in Pangasinan is fast return- 
ng to normal, 1 ' Sofronio Quimson 
fiuhtary governor of Pangasinan, 
leclarcd in a press interview in Ma- 
nia yesterday. 

Quimson was the first military gov- 
ernor installed in Luzon after the re- 
turn of Gen. MacArthur. The gov- 
ernor said that schools have been 
reopened in his province, and that 
more than 105,000 children attend

ALLIES GAIN IN BURMA 

CALCUTTA — Allied tanks have 
slashed through the Japanese pocket 
in Burma south of Mandalay to take 
the important town of Kume on the 
main Mandalay truck highway. The 
Allies also have won control of road 
and rail lines to Thazi, just east of 
Meiktila. Motorized infantry occupied 
town after town in the shrinking Jap- 
anese pocket between Mandalay and 




TOKIO — "Do our American ene- 
mies who have established bases in 
the Marianas, and landed huge forces 
in the Philippines and on Iwo Jima, 
think it is going to be easy to sub- 
jugate Japan proper?' 1 a Domei 
broadcast asked last Monday. 

Domei then proceeded to answer the 
question: "It was the Americans' 
superior air force and task forces 
which enabled them to carry out their 
offensive in the Southwest Pacific 
within a relatively short period of 
time. In other words it was because 
our garrisons at important points 
were forced to light isolated and with- 
out hope for relief under heavy enemy 
bombardment that the Americans 
achieved such success. 

"When an island is flat and nar- 
row and is garrisoned only by a small 
force it is difficult to defend " Domei 
continued. ''Although our forces 
fought a flaming offensive and our 
special attack air corps forced the 
enemy to take desperate measures at 
the outset of - the battle, victory at

Domei "Invites" Americans To 
Launch Invasion Of Formosa 

Leyte was not ours* Thus, the failure 
of the Leyte campaign was due to the 
difficulty of supplies and extremely 
small fighting strength." 

The news agency then shifted to 
the future, saying that the "main 
phase of the Philippines battle is final- 
ly about to be opened, and the main 
strength of our Imperial Army is 
eagerly awaiting action to bleed the 
enemy decisively and heavily. We 
have ignored the enemy's air force 
and were our fliers to be allowed to 
give full expression to their talents, 
how much greater our war results 
would be! 

Domei said that an American inva- 
sion of Formosa was to be desired. It 
added-that if the XL S. should land 
an army of 200,000 or more trotms

(rvi&g Berlin Here, Presents New 
Philippine Song to Commonwealth Today 



FN MACARTHUR ON CORREGIDOR — With members of his staff, 
ommander-in-Chief disembarks from a PT boat after U. S. troops 

out the Japanese garrison. 



Irving Berlin, famous American 
composer, arrived in Manila Monday 
after a six-week slay in Leyte. He 
will introduce his new song Heaven 
Watch the Philippines in a welcome 
program to be held at Malacanan 
grounds this morning at eleven 
o'clock. Berlin's new song is dedi- 
cated to Gen. Dbuglas MacArthur in 
commemoration of his liberation of 
the Philippines. 

"When I arrived in Leyte, I heard 
Filipino boys and girls singing my 
song God Bless America;' Berlin said 
in a press interview yesterday. 
"But the boys and girls singing the 
song changed the words to "God 
bless the Philippines," and that 
touched me very deeply. It made me 
feel that perhaps the Filipinos would 
also like to have a sons of their own. 
So I wrote Heaven Watch the Phil- 
ippines, 

Irving Berlin will personally pre- 
sent the scroll of his new song to the 
Philippine Commonwealth at Malaca- 
nan during today's program. He 
will also conduct the general singing 
of Heaven Watch the Pnilippines

Market Thug Threatens 
Agent Making Arrest 

"It has become difficult for us to 
enforce the price control laws in the 
city because certain market vendors 
have engaged the services of alleged 
guerrillas who threaten us with bodily 
harm if we insist in discharging our 
duties strictly," declared a Manila 
price control agent yesterday. 

The price officer said he was 
threatened by a man in uniform in a 
Manila market last week after he had 
arrested a woman who had sold eggs 
above the ceiling price. ^^^^^

Japanese Forming 
Civilian Home Army 

TOKYO — Japanese military lea-

children, into a "people's volunteer 
army" for final defense of the home 
land, Domei reported Sunday. The 
"armv" is to be similar to Heinncn 
Himmler's Volksturm in Germany. 

"All those whb have finished the 
first six years of schooling, and up 
to the age of 65 for men and 45 for 
women, will be eligible for member- 
I ship," Domei said. 



Russians Note Alarm 
Among Japan's Rulers 

MOSCOW— The Japanese war si- 
tuation "calls forth no small amount 
of alarm in Japanese ruling circles, 
the newspaper Pravda told its readers 
Sunday. . . 

"The Japanese place great signi- 
ficance on'the loss of Iwo Jima be- 
cause the struggle for the island show- 
ed what a powerful war effort the 
Allies are capable of," the editorial 
said. "In addition to this, Japanese 
ruling circles cannot but take into ac- 
count the tenseness which character- 
izes the internal situation in the Jap- 
anese empire"

JAPAN STANDS CONDEMNED 

The world is leading about the rape of Manila. Last Sunday Drift- 
§m Carlos P. Romulo, Philippine resident commissioner in Wasktogtffit 
delivered a nation-wide broadcast in which he described the burning al%v® 
130 civilians in Manila, Last Saturday the Spanish government, out" 
at the bayoneting of 17*2 Spanish men, women and children by 3&f 9 
twzn troops in Manila, il demanded satis {action" from Tokyo, The pre#$ 
°f the world, fed by honest, unbiased reporters, had already told yxirt of 
the story of Japanese atrocities in the capital of the Philippines, 

fiy now there can be no doubt that the Japanese acted in cold blood 
destroy as much property and kill as many Filipinos as they could. There 
cm n<t longer be any question about what the Japs meant when they tola 
f*&pko$: "The Americans may return, but you won't he here to 86$ 
them," £j a d a Q $$n physically possible, the Japanese would have killw 
wtry Filipino and destroyed every building in the Philippines, FortUWtW

FOR EARLY ACTION 

WASHINGTON — The Philippines 
thc ^ r independence on July 4, 
r Jr BQoner f despite the fact their 
glands have been ravjshed by war, 
Jaij^i Hernandez, Commonwealth fi- 
nance secretary, declared Sunday, 

Hernandez made this statement in 
commenting on the suggestion of 
raul V, MeNutt, former Philippines 
™£h commissioner, that independence 
pe deferred at least until after the 
Jfilaride recover from ravages of war- 
The* finance secretary maintained 
tiiat "political and economic questions 
are entirely distinct" and that "there 
K Jto question in the mind of any 
jUipmo that he desires his indepen- 
dence at the time promised by Con- 
£i"fisa or earlier, if President Roose- 
Ve g should choose to advance the day." 

Hernandez, who is co-chairman of 
w Philippine Rehabilitation Commis- 
sion, recently proposed that Congress 
jrant a 20-year extenson of existing 
United States^Philippines trade rela- 
tionships. He said most Filipinos 
would prefer "independence with 
y™*ip >f to any other political 
status with economic benefits. 




FOR REHABILITATION 

WASHINGTON— Rehabilitation of 
the Philippines should be placed 
ahead of independence, Senator Ken- 
neth D. McKellar urged Sunday hi 
disclosing that the Senate Appro-po- 
tions committee has approved ie 
lation for a survey of the islands 
economic problems pending the gt&&> 
in ^ of independence. 

"I do not mean that we should i lot 
give the Philippines their indci"-"- 
dence," McKellar stressed, fl W$ 
should and we shalL But while } ve 
are talking about it, we should r ivo 
them what they need." 

McKellar said the Appropriations 
committee has approved lcgislnli° n 
providing: $80,000 for the salaries 
and expenses of a new high commis- 
sioner and technical assistants to sur- 
vey conditions in the Philippics. 
Under the plan, a commissioner 
would be sent to the Philippines mr- 
mediately and report his finding* to 
the Philippines Rehabilitation com- 
mision, which is currently seeking to

Tokyo Claims American Landings^ 
In Ryukyu Island Group Continuing 

C . M T^AisrrTqrO— The Japanese garrison is engaging American troops 
SAN FRANUbUU— ine ■ « islands according to a Tokyo radio 
in the Koraina -J^'^S^ ommuniSe heaYd here yesterday, 
report of th e Japanese neaoguai * Japanese report that American 

* forces landed on Monday has not been 
confirmed by any Allied source, 

"So far the enemy landing attempts 
have merely been to test our 
strength" Domei broadcasts said, 
"The deduction is that the enemy has 
groups of supply ships and transports 
waiting in the rear. Therefore it is 
thought most likely that the enemy 
will soon attempt a full scale landing. 

"The enemy's new operation in the 
Ryukyus has been aimed to gain part 
of the islands, but it may spread to 
relatively large islands in the Oki- 
nawas. The enemy's strategy to land 
on the Okinawas clearly reveals that, 
first he is attempting to gain a base 
on the shortest route to China in 
an attempt to sever the supply line 
between Japan and the southern re- 
gions, including Taiwan (Formosa). 
Second, he is attempting to tighten 
the air and sea encirclement of 
Japan in conjunction with his iwo 
Jima operations,"

advance from the north. 

The 6th and 43rd divisions were

sistance on two mountains in the 
area, , L . L , 

"V* Corps troops in the northern

F. D. R. Asks Trade 
Pact Extension 

WASHINGTON— President Hoose- 
velt urged renewal and strengthening 
of the reciprocal trade act, which ex- 
pires in June, in a message to Con- 
gress Monday. 

The president asked the action as 
part of an effort to "eliminate econo- 
mic warfare, to make practical inter- 
national cooperation on as many 
fronts as possible... and to bring 
about conditions under which the na- 
tions of the world substitute coopera- 
tion, and sound business principles 
for warfare in their economic rela- 
tions." 

Roosevelt explained that "business 
people m ail countries want to know 
the rules under which postwar trade 
wifl be operated. If it is clear that 
burners to foreign trade are coming 
down all around the world, business 
men can and will direct production to 
tilings that look more promising un- 
der those conditions. In that case, 
real and large and permanent ex- 
pansion of international trade be- 
conies possible."

He added that "the whoi & of the 
United States Navy in the P^eif ic was 
on the offensive" in those 12: months, 
and that "the Battle of tine Pacific 
has been carried more thsn -3,000 
miles westward — from the 3Iar shall 
islands into the South Chin& sea be- 
yond the Philippines— and to- the ap- 
proaches of Tokyo." 

King reported that during the year 
the American navy participated in 
i2 actions in the Pacific, Atlantic and 
^Mediterranean, including 24 landings 
in the Pacific, 35 carrier attacks and 
two major naval battles — those of 
the Philippines sea and Leyne gulf. 

"The essential element of o^ir domi- 
nance over the Japanese has been the 
strength of our fleet," Kirrg added. 
"The ability to move troops: from is- 
land to island and to put them ashore 
against opposition is due fc&j the fact 
hat our combined forces ar^ spread-

Emphasizing the teamwoark involv-

STRATEGIC ROLE OF PHILIPPINES 

The Philippine a?e playing a mighty and strategic role in the expand- 
ing offensive against Japan. , 

Commenting in an editorial in American newspapers last week an me 
pari being played by the Commonwealth, Wilfrid Fleisher, former manag- 
ing editor vf the Tokyo Advertiser, mid; t . 

"The position of the Philippines in the sustained offensive against Ja- 
pan is of dual importance. From the Philippines, Japan can be cut off 
from her subjugated territories. Prom the Philippines, Japan itself can 
be attacked, 

"la the battle for Leyte gulf, which made possible the early stages of 
the Philippine campaign, our forces toak their first steps toward gaining 
a forward base for extending our operations to other islands. At the same 
time, the Jajxinese fleet was struck such a blow that it has been unable 
to supply or reinforce Japanese ground troops in that area t nor has it 
been able to protect the Lifeline from Burma and hidonesia to Japan. 

"Since Leyte, more than SO triphibious operations have been carried 
out suecesa fully* From Mindanao and Palawan, a steady aerial cross- fire 
can he maintained against the rich Japanese-held oil dejfosits of Borneo. 
The airfields that ring Manila and others on the central Luzon plain deny 
the Japanese safe use of the south China sea as far as Indo-Ghina. 1 * 



Crack Guerri'la 
Regiment Attached 
To U. S. Division 

The distinct ion of betn^ the first 
guerrilla regiment to be attached to 
the U. Army went to the Marking 
Guerrillas when the Yay Regiment, 
with Col. Marcos V. Agustin com- 
manding; took the field with the U.S. 
43rd division last week. The Yay 
regiment is rated the crack combat 
unit of the Marking Guerrillas 
and has a combat strength of L,2UU 
men, fully armed and equipped* 

This recognition of the fighting 
qualities of thy unit was a result of 
three years' resistance by Agustin 
and his hill army against the Japan- 
ese. Willi the arrival of the libera- 
tion forces, Agustin continued the 
fighl against the Japa in Rifcal. 

Agustin requested permission for 
his force to fight beside the Amer- 
icans. He was taken into the U. S + 
Army with the rank of colonel of in- 
fan try, in command of the Yay re- 
giment, and attached to the U. S« 
43 rd division, whose commanding 
general is Maj, Gen. Leonard Wing. 



Japs Offered PlO,OQO 
Reward for Capture 
Of Mans/a Dentist 

Vicente Domingo, 40-year-old Ma- 
niU dentist, for whose head a reward 
of I* 10 ,1)00 was offered by the Japan- 
esc Army in 1943, returned to the 
city yesterday as a guerrilla major, 
under Major Edwin P, R&msey of the 
East Central Luzon guerrilla area. 

Domingo was credited with killing 
four Japanese officers single-handed 
in a jrun duel m his clinic on Her- 
ran, Paco, during the latter part of 
1943, He was brought there from 
Fort Santiago by the Japanese offi- 
cers to surrender his firearm. Once 
inside the clinic Dr. Domingo man- 
aged to free himself and use his gun. 

He made his way from the city 
through the help of cocheros, stable 
hoys, boatmen and poor farmers. 
Reaching the hills of San Mateo, he 
joined the guerrilla forces of Colonel 
FHnnrdn M-mahaii, and later trans- 
fer ed to the headquarters of Major 
Ramsey in Montalban. 



Evacuees from South 
Report Guerrillas Busy 

Running a gauntlet of Japanese 
sniper fire, evacuees by the hundred 
from the lake towns of Bay, Cala- 
uang and Sta. Cruz, Laguna are 
daily pouring in from the battle 
areas in the south, to seek haven 
behind the American lines. 
. Dolores Jebulan and her niece, 
Estela Borises* longtime residents of 
Sta, Crua, reported that they and 
scores of other residents were eva- 
cuated in four baricaa from the ghost 
town of Sta. Cruz to Calumba, Just 
as the party seemed safe, 20 of their 
number were killed by Jap machine- 
gun and rifle fire. Possibly several 
thousand civilians are still in those 
towns, virtual prisoners of the Japs. 

Mrs* Jebulan told of how the La- 
cuna provincial capital was thrice 
set afire by the enemy. "During the 
early part of last month, American 
planes bombed their big air raid shel- 
ter near a rice field/ 1 she stated. 
"This caused the Japs considerable 
casualties, and was followed by a 
guerrilla attack. In the ensuing 
fight, the Japs fired the town to 
cause confusion among the civilians 
and the guerrilla forces,"

Navarro Appointed 
Acting Head of Mindoro 

Juan Navarro, twice-elected prov- 
incial governor of Mindoro before 
the war, has been appointed acting 
governor of that province by the 
army authorities there, according to 
a prominent Batangas citizen who 
arrived in Manila yesterday- 

Navatro joined the Mindoro guerri- 
llas with his 22-year-old son, Aristeo, 
who fought in Bataan and was later 
imprisoned by the Japs in Cap as, 
Tar lac. He was instrumental in iron- 
ing out differences between two lead- 
ing guerrilla bands. 

When the American forces landed 
in Mindoro December 15, Navarro 
and his men were partly responsible 
for the speedy annihilation of the 
Japanese in the island.

according to Dr. Marciano S. Fona-

American troops have landed on 
ictan island, off the east coast of 
bu, and seized its principal town of 
on, Southwest Pacific headquarters 
nounced this morning. Troops of 
i Americal division made the land- 
>, and also seized nearby Cauit is- 
td, a former seaplane base. 
3n the Cebu mainland, the main 
•ce of the Americal division struck 
rth and south from blasted Cebu 
y to capture Lahug and Naga air- 
,ds. Enemy resistance still appear- 
to be disorganized. The Americans 
i heavy air support. 
General MacArthur's earlier com- 
mique announced that enemy resis- 
lce had definitely abated in the 
ith and central sectors of Luzon, 
emy efforts are becoming discon- 
ited and sporadic due to the great 
ses which he cannot replace. The 
>my "seems unable to grasp our 
hnique of attack," General Mac- 
thur said.

Right-Hand Drive Change Postponed 

The traffic regulation providing for road traffic to move on the 
right instead of the left, scheduled to go into effect in Manila April 
1, was suspended yesterday. 

The effective date of the change was postponed to June 1, Col. M. 
E. Jones, chief police, announced, because of the impossibility of coor- 
dinating and informing traffic authorities in all Philippines provinces 
at the present time. 



Soviets Take Gydnia, 
Drive Near Vienna 

MOSCOW— Gydnia, pre-war Polish 
port and German Baltic naval base 
since the war, was captured by the 
Russians Wednesday. Nine thousand 
German prisoners were taken in Gyd-- 
nia as the Russians raced agaihst 
time toward Danzig before the big 
show against Berlin commences. Al- 
ready, part of Danzig has been taken. 

Other Soviet forces were ten miles 
from the Austrian frontier and only 
34 miles from Vienna, the capital. 
The Nazis were resisting furiously 
the Soviet drive on Austria, which 
would cut off many German divisions. 
Soviet planes supported the ground 
forces all the way from the western 
Baltic front to the far south. 



Night Traffic Urged 

Movement of heavy equipment at 
night is urged by Col. Marcus E. 
Jones, deputy provost marshal and 
Manila chief of police, to lighten day- 
time traffic over Jones Bridge. This 
traffic bottleneck can be eased if the 
military will arrange to move heavy 
equipment through the Jones Bridge 
area between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m., Col. 
Jones added. 



Liberated Prisoners 
Cared for by Russians 

ODESSA— The Russians have had 
to solve tremendous problems in es- 
tablishing transit quarters in this 
Crimean city for United Nations pri- 
soners freed from German camps, 
according to Christian Science Mon- 
itor correspondent Alexander Werth. 

Thousands of liberated American, 
British, French, Italian, Dutch and 
Belgian prisoners have been trans- 
ported to two transit camps being 
rapidly set up in Odessa. 

"Both British and American of- 
ficers in charge," Werth wrote, "have 
paid warm tributes to the speed with 
which everything was organized by 
the Russians in spite of extremely 
great difficulties. The officer in 
charge of the whole organization ad- 
mitted he seldom got more than two 
or three hours sleep a night, and 
some nights none. ,, 

Describing the embarkation of 2,- 
000 Frenchmen in eight hours, Werth 
said, "the French marched to the 
ship with a Russian military band at 
their head. The Germans looked on 
dismally as the French prisoners who 
had spent five years in German hands 
marched past and made remarks 
about their changing fortune." 



Ernesto Vallejo, Noted Filipino 
Violinist, Reported Victim of Japs 



Ernesto Vallejo, world famous 
Filipino violinist, and his family 
were murdered by Japanese troops in 
Tanauan, Batangas, during a mass 
slaughter of government officials, 
priests and civilans in that munici- 
pality on Feb. 10, according to 
Jose L. Guevara, Tanauan lawyer. 

Vallejo, his wife and two children 
evacuated to Tanauan last Novem- 
ber believing the Japs would not com- 
mit any atrocities there, since it is 
puppet President Laurel's home town. 
Before he was killed, Vallejo had been 
entertaining Jap. soldiers with his 
music by order of their officers. 

Guevara arrived in Manila a few 
days ago. He said his father, mother 
and a sister were murdered a week 
ago by retreating Jap soldiers in 



Barrio Balakilong, Talisay, an eva- 
cuation center in Batangas near Ta- 
gaytay. People of the barrio did not 
believe the Japs would go there, he 
reported, since it is surrounded by 
towns already liberated. But one 
morning last week about 300 heavily 
armed Japs appeared, and shot every 
person they could find. 

During the Tanauan slaughter, Ma- 
nuel Gonzales, assistant chief of the 
defunct bureau of investigation, was 
killed, together with the municipal 
mayor, Nicolas Gonzales, the chief of 
police, Jorge Collantes and the mun- 
icipal treasurer. The pro-Jap mayor, 
Agaton Burgos, who took Gonzales' 
place, was later killed by the Japs. 
Almost all of Laurel's henchmen are 
believed to have been killed. 



Europe War 
Nearing End, 
C. in C. Avers 

PARIS— While U. S. Third army 
columns bored 34 miles beyond 
Frankfurt-on-Main, the American 
First, Third and Seventh forged a 
united front nearly 80 miles long 
deep within Germany, yesterday's 
Allied communique stated. 

Everywhere along this front the 
Allies were advancing, and to the 
north the British and Canadians and 
the American Ninth army also storm- 
ed ahead in the race for Berlin. 

Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, su- 
preme Allied commander in the west, 
declared that the war in Europe is 
nearing its end. 

The heavy enemy resistance in the 
northern sector of the Lower Rhine 
bridgehead showed signs of slacken- 
ing, the communique said. British 
forces have extended their hold on 
the Emmerich-Wesel railroad, while to 
the east Allied troops crossed the Issel 
River and entered the town of Ding- 
den. East and south of Wesel, nu- 
merous other coipmunities were taken, 
and some units were within 1,000 
yards of the main Ruhr airbase. 

Infantry units following up armor- 
ed units cleared Limburg, while Weis- 
baden was captured Wednesday by 
the American Ninth Army. 

Three suburbs of Frankfurt-on- 
Main were cleared of the enemy as 
armored units fought in the main part 
of the city after crossing the river 
on a railroad bridge which was dam- 
aged but not destroyed. In support 
of the ground forces, fighter-bombers 
attacked German motor vehicle con- 
centrations in the Frankfurt area, 
destroying more than 600 vehicles. 
Troop concentrations at other points 
were also attacked. 

The Allied lines are advancing so 
fast that new firing zones are esta- 
blished every twenty minutes, one 
dispatch reported. 

On March 26, Allied forces in the 
west took 19,712 prisoners. About 
6,500 Germans surrendered to the 
Americans Tuesday on the east side 
of the Rhine. 



EUROPEAN AIR ACTION 

PARIS — American heavy bombers 
struck armament plants in Berlin in 
daylight Wednesday, as other bom- 
bers attacked Hanover. During the 
week from March 15 to 22, 51,000 
American planes were over Europe.

Ickes Supports 
McNufcfc on Delay 
In Independence 

WASHINGTON— Secretary of the 
Interior Harold L Ickcs, whose de- 
mrtment supervises insular affairs, 
it'clared Monday nijrht that the 
f uited States should "give the Phil- 
ippine whatever it wants, ,} but at the 
f ame time expressed the view that in- 
dependence now would be harmful* 

Ickes* statement follows the recent 
unofficial suggestion of Paul V, Mc- 
Nutt, former Philippines high com- 
missioner, that granting of full in- 
dependence be deferred pending eco- 
nomic rehabiltntion. Mc Null's pro- 
posal brought declarations from nu- 
merous Philippines officials in favor 
of independence as soon as possible. 

Several weeks ago, the authorita- 
tive Wall Street Journal quoted In- 
terior department sources as favor- 
ing tome sort ot "dominion status" for 
the Philippines and continued free 
trade witn the United States. 

In his statement Monday, Ickes 
said: "We want to aid the Philip- 
pines, whose loyalty to the United 
Stiues during the war has been above 
any possible question, but I fear that 
the war has made inroads into its 
economics, politics and government 
too severe to permit a complete break 
with the United States at this time. 

"I believe that a high commissioner 
should he sent to the islands as soon 
as possible and that he should study 
the problems there, working right 
along with Philippine leaders and the 
Philippine people," 

Meanwhile the Senate passed and 
sent back to the House the appropria- 
tions bill which carried authorization 
for $80,000 to pay the salaries of a 
high commissioner and assistants who 
would suivey the economic position of 
the Commonwealth. The commissioner 
would report quarterly to the Philip- 
pine Rehabilitation commission. 

Senator Robert Taxt, Ohio Repub- 
lican, took a different view of Phil- 
ippines independence when he assert- 
ed? "We made a promise and we must 
keep it* I am in favor of more li- 
beral treatment for the Philippines 
than is provided for now under the 
law, but I believe that we should set 
them free at least by 1946."

NEW YORK— Confusion and des-

the Allied advance into the heart of 
Germany gains momentum, according 
to radio reports monitored here, 
Gorman stations broadcast desperate 
warnings on the gravity of the situa-

urged them to flee from the path of 
the advancing armies. 

The enemy youth leader, Arthur 
, Axmann, declared in a broadcast 
from Berlin that "our nation is in 
danger." A special broadcast to the 
German forces appealed to them to 
hold out despite all losses and de- 
feats, even though our plight is grow-

Hand-picked from units all over 



rack Allied Units 
or Rhine Smash 

WITH U. S. NINTH ARMY — 
eparations for the complex cross- 
es of the Rhine river were laid 
&r a month ago, according to an 
aerican war correspondent. Amer- 
m naval units clothed in army uni- 
rms were brought to Holland for 
lining in crossing rivers with naval 
ift. 

American paratroopers were pulled 
t of' infantry lines and were re- 
ouped in preparation for the land- 
*s on the east side of the Rhine, 
me of the crack Allied infantry 
its were moved to the rear for pro- 
lged training on the Maas river in 
>lland. 

Th« correspondent added: 'I 
itched the assault on the Rhine 
3m an observation post, and it was 
3 most terrifying single spectacle 
have ever seen. One important 
lineland junction point was smo- 
sred in red and yellow flame from

The objective was taken with

2NTHS AHEAD CRITICAL 

WASHINGTON — President Roose- 
It has advised the State department 
it "as the next few months will be 
critical importance, I feel that all 
iefs of missions should remain at 
sir posts." 



the Southwest Pacific, 3& unlisted 
men and Lt, Pompea were taken to 
Mindanao by submarine. That was 
in September, 1944, weeks "before the 
Leyte landings. 

Their job was to establish a radio 
network that would warn American 
bases to the south of Jap aircraft 
movements. Guerrilla help was pro- 
mised, but offsetting this was the 
danger of discovery By the large Jap 
garrison on Mindanao, 

The first contacts with the Japs 
came soon after the radio equipment 
was put into operation. Enemy pa- 
trols were observed by the guerrillas 
heading for several outposts estab- 
lished by the radiomen. Within a 
few hours, the outposts were dis- 
mantled and set up in new sites. 

"We kept moving and the Japs 
kept following," the young officer 
declared. "Although there were sev- 
eral times when it looked bad, they 
neyer caught up with us." 

The men had brought rations only 
for 30 days, but their mission 
stretched into months. The Filipinos 
contributed food and some of the sol- 
diers shot wild deer and pigs in the 
Mindanao jungles. , 

The biggest thrill came a few 
weeks after they had established 
their radio service. One man, fiddly 
ing with the dials, thought he heard 
an announcement from "Radio Ley- 
te." .The others crowded around. 
Soon over the crackling wireless 
came a broadcast announcing that 
American authorities had established 
ceiling prices on food to prevent in- 
flation in Leyte. 

"We knew then the Philippines had 
been invaded," said Pompea. "We 
passed the word to the Filipinos, and 
they celebrated. We did, too, with 
some Jap whisky a guerrilla gave us." 

The platoon's hazardous mission 
ended when American forces estab- 
lished a beachhead at Zamboanga in 
March and quickly overran large 
areas in Mindanao. 

The men reported "mission accom- 
plished" with no losses. Not a single 
casualty marred their five-month ex- 
pedition to the Jap-held island, 
though several were hospitalized for 
malaria and jungle illnesses.

of the word,^but "just a reunion to 
find out who are alive and who are 
dead." 

A number questioned the present** 
of former members of the Jap-domin 
ated Assembly under the .puppet re 
public. 

The congressmen took no definite 
steps regarding legislation or the cre- 
ation of committees, for lack of quo- 
rum. Fifty congressmen would be 
necessary to constitute a quorum. 
However, Senator Rordiguez said he 
would be willing to hear, any member 
present pressing problems affecting 
his district or province. In turn Ro 
driguez would transmit such informa 
tion to President Osmena for com 
ment and action. 

Even had there been a quorum at 
the meeting, a number of congress- 
men present said they believed the 
body had no right to legislate, in view 
of the presence of certain senators 
and representatives who were offi- 
cials during the Japanese regime. 

The most outspoken^ exponent of this 
belief was Representative Leon Cobar- 
roguis of Nueva Vizcaya, who said: 
"I am questioning the authority of 
the Congress of the Philippines to 
convene until we have a quorum. And 
if we have a quorum, with the pre- 
sence of all the living members, can 
we proceed with the presence of snip- 
ers inside? I am referring to con- 
I pressmen who were also members of

PARIS — American army engineers 
Are using 25,000 tons of steul cap- 
tured from the great Krupp works to 
build bridges across the Rhine, an 
Allied headquarters spokesman an- 
nounced Tuesday. 

The spokesman said that the large 
■tock of structural steel is only a 
>;u*t of the booty taken from the 
Krupp plants at Kheinshoven and 
Krefeld by the advancing American 
forces v- their drive on the Rhine,

Difficulty in contacting quali- 
fied jurists who evacuated to the 
provinces is impeding complete reor- 
ganization of the Department of Jus- 
tice, according to Secretary of Jus- 
tice Del fin Jaranilla. 

To date three judges have been 
nameo" for the Manila Court of First 
Instance, They are Mamerto Roxas, 
Arsenio Dizon and Pompeyo Diaz. A 
fourth appointee is still in Japanese- 
held territory. 

Among judges named for Courts of 
1 Instance in liberated provinces 
arc Alfonso Alonso* for Nueva Eeija, 
Jo,- Bernabe for Pangasinan and 
Zambales, Mariano Melendres for Sa- 
mar, Fortunate Borromeo for Leyte, 
and Clementino Diez for Bohol and 
Occidental Misamis. 

Judge Mariano Larosa is mentioned 
for assignment to Batangas and Min- 
doro. Appointments for Pampanga, 
Tarlac and Bulacan are under con si - 
lerntion. 



City Engineer Dept 
Paitially Restored 

The city engineer's office is now 
functioning with a skeleton staff, 
Most of the former employees 
were hired by the United States 
Army soon after the liberation of the 
city, to work on the repair and con- 
itruction of roads and bridges. 

The reorganized office is charged 
^th the inspection and construction 
f public buildings, including slaugh- 
terhouses and markets. The acting 
city engineer is Hermenegildo R. 
Reye& 

All the records of the office were 
destroyed. Copies of city ordinances 
are being sought to which the office 
can refer in iftfiuinfr perrttrU, 



In addition to the steel, the army 
captured 1,000 tons of ferro-manga- 
nese and ferro-silicon used in making 
steel. These products will be shipped 
to the industries of Luxembourg, be- 
cause of shortages of shipments from 
the United States, 

Millions of dollars worth of engi- 
neer, railroad, ordnance, signal and 
quartermaster supplies have also been 
recovered and inventoried by the en- 
gineers. 

Person Renamed 
To Governorship 
Of Masbafce Island 

Mateo S, Pecson has been directed 
to resume his office as governor of 
Masbate by Secretary of Interior To- 
mas Confesor. He has been further 
designated representative of the De- 
partment of Interior, with instruc- 
tions to cooperate fully with the 
American army in the province. 

Confesor directed Pecson to be 
guided in the appointment of public 
officials" by the policy of the gov- 
ernment that no one who, in one 
way or another, cooperated with the 
Japanese or with the puppet govern- 
ment should be appointed to any 
public position/' 

Pecson also was instructed to "give 
preference to qualified persons who 
are loyal to the United States and to 
the Commonwealth, and, above all, to 
those who actively took part in the 
underground movement during the 
Japanese occupation." 



partment secretaries rule that any- 
one who served under the f^nese 
has lost his civil service status o 
his USAFFE standings a number ot 
Filipinos who could easily be identi- 
fied as collaborationists are being 
employed in certain branches of tne 
government." 

Ramos nroposed disqualification of 
all Filipino officials who held key 
positions under the Japanese mili- 
tary administration or the puppet 
republic, the functions of which were 
policy-determining in nature. Those 
who can prove conclusively their ac- 
tive and decisive participation in the 
resistance movement through a recog- 
nised guerrilla unit may be excepted, 
he stated. He also urged disqualifi- 
cation of all officials and employees, 
though their positions were not policy- 
determining, who wrote articles, deli- 
vered speeches or made remarks con- 
demning America and extolling the 
Japanese and their so-called co-pros- 
perity sphere, or who committed 
other positive acts of cooperation. 

All other officials and employees 
who were in the service as of Decem- 
ber 1941 provided they committed no 
act of disloyalty other than the mere 
occupation of their positions, should 
be reinstated, Ramos asserted, in ac- 
cordance with the broadcast of Pres- 
ident Osmcna over the Voice of Free- 
dom on November 23 1944. 

Ramos said lie intends to submit 
his proposals to the legislative body. 
Ramos did not perv^ tmder the Jap- 
anese, He has beeri elected four 
times in his province.

US~Brithh Fleet 
Blasts Ryukyus 
7 Straight Days 

GUAM — Powerful units of the 
British Pacific fleet have teamed up 
with the American Fifth Fleet in 
operations against the JKyukyu is- 
lands south of Japan, it was disclosed 
yesterday as the sea and air bom- 
bardment continued for the seventh 
consecutive day* 

In separate communiques, Admiral 
Nimitz revealed British battleships 
and carriers struck at the southern 
end of the Ryukyus Monday and 
Tuesday, while American operations 
continued through Thursday. Pacific 
Fleet headquarters withheld comment 
on the Japanese claim that American 
troops stormed ashore in tho central 
Ryukyus last Sunday. 

The British task force, which in- 
cluded the 35,000-ton battleship King 
George V and the 23,000-ton carrier 
Illustrious, shot down 20 enemy 
planes, sank or damaged several Jap- 
anese freighters and damaged instal- 
lations on the coast of Sakashima, 

In Thursday's action, . planes and 
warships of the American Fifth Fleet 
destroyed a number of enemy torpedo 
boats, shelled submarine pens and 
coastal batteries, and bombed air- 
fields, factories and fuel dumps on 
the main island of Okinawa, 300 miles 
south of Kyushu. Since last Satur- 
day, American units sank or dam- 
aged at least Id Japanese ships and 
destroyed 30 enemy planes in the 
Ryukyus.

Doenitz Prepares to Scuttle German Ships 



Reports from several European 
sources yesterday indicated the ex- 
tent of the disorganization of the Ger- 
man forces as a result of the sweep- 
ing Allied advance beyond the 
Rhine. 

A press dispatch from London said 
that Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz, 
chief of the German navy, had issued 
orders to "crews of all German war- 
ships in Baltic ports to scuttle their 
ships if they could not remove them 
safely." 



Outfit In Action Again Only II 
Days After Liberating Ifoilo 

■ American troops have landed on the west coast of Neeros crossing 
Gmmaras Strait, with the usual overwhelming naval and air support 
General Mac Arthur announced this morning, pp ^ 

The landing was made near Bago at 9:30 Thursday mornini? bv the 
American 40th division, veteran California National Guard unit which li* 
berated Iloilo^ Panay, only eleven days before. The new action follows by 
only three days the American landings on Cebu. 

— — <8> The Eighth army unit went ashore 

unopposed and drove one column four- 
teen miles to the northeast, brushimr 
aside scattered enemy resistance to 
capture Bacolod airdrome nnd reach 
the outskirts of the capita! at Bacolod, 
A second ccEumn swept eleven miles 
south, capturing Ponte Vcdra. It 
then pushed inland along the Bago 
river, made contact with guerrilla 
forces under Colonel Abccdc, and 
secured Santa Aniceta. 
m The Americal division on Cebu con- 
tinued advancing from Cebu city to 
the northeast, clearing enemy resis- 
tance north of Guadalupe. Along Iho 
coast of the island, Mandaue and 
Manda have been taken. Americal 
units in the south have made contact 
with Colonel Cushing's guerrillas and 
were rapidly clearing all areas. 

Throughout the entire Visayan area 
comprising the central portion of the 
Philippines, the enemy seems be- 
wildered and his defense is rapidly 
collapsing, General Mac Arthur report- 
ed. Preoccupied in Luzon and fear* 
ful for positions in Mindanao, the 
Japanese have neglected the central 
islands, leaving them exposed to a se- 
ries of vital thrusts. 

Caballo island, south of Corrcgidor, 
has also been secured, the communique 
said. Elements of the American 38th 
division landed on the tiny, rugged 
island at the southern edge of Manila 
bay on Wednesday, swarming over 
rock and wall defenses to secure the 
stronghold in one day. 

Troops in southern and central Lu- 
zon continued to advance east 
of Manila and engaged in mopping 
up in the Sierra Mad re and Zamba- 
'es ranges. I Corps troops continued 
pressure on Balete pass, main route 
through the northern hills to Cagayan 
valley. 

Air action reported in General Mac- 
Arthur's earlier communique listed a 
200-ton bombing attack on enemy de- 
fenses and installations at Legaspi 
and continued air sweeps over Caga- 
yan valley. 

Heavy units bombed Silay and Ca- 
rolina airdromes on Negros, and Jolo 
and Tawi Tawi on Mindanao. 

Planes on the China sea blockade 
sank a 5,000-ton Jap cargo ship and

Danube Advance 
Carries Russians 
To Austrian Border 

MOSCOW — The Russian drive up 
the Danube valley raged unchecked 
yesterday, as Soviet columns ground 
forward to the border of Austria, 
within 39 miles of Vienna, according 
to Marshal Stalin's communique. 
■ The Red Army pushed along both 
banks of the river from central Slo- 
vakia to reach the border while other 
forces to the south threatened to 
crash through the Nazis' border de- 
fenses from western Hungary- 

Far to the northeast, the Russians 
put the finishing touch to the battle 
for East Prussia by capturing the 
capital, Koenigsberg. The triumph 
ended a 14-day siege, in which 80,000 
Germans were killed and another 50,- 
000 captured. 



Australians Drive Japs 
From Bougainville Hill 

MELBOURNE— Australian forces 
have gained new successes in driv- 
ing the by-passed Japanese out of 
the northern Solomons. After more 
than two months' fighting, the Aus- 
sies captured an important hill on the 
Sarokan peninsula of northern Bou- 
gainville. They also, cleaned out the 
enemy west of the Puriata river in 
the southern part of the island. 



Another American correspondent 
reported that high Nazi party officials 
were in general flight toward the 
Bavarian Alps and toward the Swiss 
border. • 

A London dispatch said that "Ger- 
man officers all over the front are 
surrendering*their forces piecemeal to 
the advancing Allies amid a welter of 
accusations and counter charges di- 
rected by their officers against the 
Nazi high command and political 
IpndpTfihip," 



jt'REE PHILIPPINES 



US, Planes Used 
Guerrilla Airfield 
To Cover Landing 

WASHINGTON— American fighter 
;>l&n«j taking off from an airfield m 
thft guerrilla-held portion of Minda- 
nao covered the March 11 landing 
operation near Zamboanga, according 
Lo Representative Karl Stefan. 

The Japanese had known the lo- 
cation of the air base behind their 
J meg but had been unable to wrest it 
from the Philippine Army forces, he 
pointed out in praising the important 
contribution the Filipino nghtmg men 
have made in the Philippines cam- 
paign of liberation, ''American^ 1 ih- 
pino cooperation, both in deigning 
and building that airfield, saved hun- 
dreds of American lives and speeded 
the advance of the American forces 
on Mindanao/' he added, 

"But the accomplishments of the 
Philippine Army forces on Mindanao 
under the leadership of Coh Wendell 
W, Fertig are but a few of the many 
examples of directed action against 
the Japanese during the three years 
they occupied the Philippines. 

"A like situation confronted the 
American landing force on Panay- 
Not only did the Filipino troops, un- 
der Col. Macario Peralta Jr., aid the 
Americans in liberating the capital 
city of Iloilo, but they had practically 
cleared the interior and coastal zones 
of Japanese before the Americans 
arrived, 

"Americans also have been cheered 
recently by reports of forces composed 
of Chinese residents of the Philippines 
who have kept up an unabated war- 
fare against the Japanese in Luzon 
since 1942* 

"The universality of the integrat- 
ed Filipino resistance throughout the 
Philippines has been one of the out- 
standing features of this campaign. 
This comradeship and courage will 
continue to be called upon until the 
homeland is free* They have made a 
contribution to an understanding be- 
tween Americans and Filipinos which 
will long endure as a tribute to their 
selfless sacrifice. 

Far Eastern University 
Is Being Reorganized 

Far Eastern University is being 
reorganized under Rafael Roces Sr. 
as acting president. Its former pres- 
ident, Nicanor Reyes was killed by 
the Japanese with his whole family, 
in south Manila, 

Eoces plans as a first step toward 
the reestablishment of the university, 
to open the 3rd and 4th year classes 
of the law school. Dean of the law 
school, Leoncio Monzon, has been 
asked by Roces to get his staff to- 
gether. The school is to be housed 
in the Manila College of Pharmacy 
building in Zurbaran St. The build- 
ings of the Far Eastern University 
are at present being used by the Uni-

court to handle the heavy volume of 
petty charges in Greater Manila ia 
urged by court officers to better serve 
the public. It is proposed that the 
new branches be established along the 
district lines followed by the Philip- 
pine Civil Affairs Units- 

At present there are two municipal 
courts in Manila, one located in the 
crowded Central Hotel building and 
another at the Meisic police station. 
Another court is handled by a J udge- 
at-large, who moves from one end of 
Manila to the other to hear cases. 

Court officials point out that the 
growing volume of municipal ca.ses, 
the difficulty in transportation, and 
general law-enforcement problems 
make it next to impossible for the 
existing municipal courts to handle 
all the cases. 

Under the proposed plan, a muni-

Yank Airmen Gave 
"Solid Cover" for 
Landing on Cebu 

CEBU CITY— A 200-ton bombing 
of Japanese strong points along the 
beach and in the interior of the is- 
land helped doughboys of the Amer- 
ica! division as they swafmed ashore 
at Cebu island. 

Bombers and fighters of the 13th 
AAF, in two hours of unopposed ac- 
tivity before the first landings were 
made at. Talisay, pounded Cebu city, 
gun positions, bridges, vehicles and 
supply dumps. 

Not a single Japanese plane was 
sighted by the "Jungle Air Force" 
crews that flew protective cover over 
the invading infantrymen. The air 
over the landing barges was filled 
with formations of B-24 Liberators, 
B-25 Mitchells and P-61 Black Wi- 
dows, plus A-SQs of the 5th AAF, 

Marine fighters destroyed 24 ene- 
my vehicles by strafing in advance 
of the invasion troops. The attack 
began shortly after daylight. 



DEADLINE * FOR STALLS 

Five o'clock tomorrow afternoon is 
the deadline for persons wishing to 
lease their former stalls or market 
tiendas to present proof of their pre- 
vious occupancy to the various market 
offices. The Emergency Control admi- 
nistration listed the following papers 
which must be shown : Market collec- 
tors' tickets issued as of December, 
1941; stall holder's identification card; 
assignment of stall by city authori- 
ties, and affidavit of market master 
or collector that the applicant held 
the_market stall as of December, 1941, 



from Tondo and Caloocan, The pre- 
eent Meisic court would hear only 
cases coming from San Nwolas, 
nondo and Trozo. The Central Hotel 
court would take care of cases from 
Quiapo, Sta. Cruz, Sampaloc and ban 
Migueh The plan also calls for ano- 
ther court to be established at ban 
Juan with jurisdiction over cases in 
that district and in Sta, Mesa and 
Quezon City. At least two municipal 
courts are urged for south Manila — 
one in Pasay to handle cases from 
that district and from San Pedro Ma- 
katf, and another in Santa Ana serve 
that district, Pandacan and Paco. A 
third court is proposed for the 
burned areas of Intramuros, Ermita 
and Malate when the need arises, 

The determination of the govern- 
ment to stamp out profiteering, pet- 
ty theft and sanitary law violations 
is flooding the present courts with 
cases that are disposed of as fast 
as possible. During the ten-day pe- 
riod ending March 27, more than 400 
profiteering cases ' were disposed of 
by the Meisic and Central Hotel 
courts. Each court handles an ave- 
rage of 70 to 80 cases a day.

tacArthur Strategy 
i Visayas Praised 
/ Sovfc Spokesman 

The successful landing of General 
acArthur's. forces in Cebu was 
aised yesterday by an Interior de- 
rtment spokesman, as driving a 
idge between Negros and Mindanao 
iere there are substantial concen- 
ations of Japanese forces. 
With the successful landing in 
Lmboanga, he said, the Japanese 
my in the Visayas and Mindanao 
L s been broken into dispersed units, 
id each of them has been placed in 
position where its fate is sealed, 
ley either surrender or suffer an- 
hilation. 

As the Japanese military situation 
ands today, Negros is isolated from 
ibu and vice versa. With the Jap- 
lese air power and shipping facili- 
2S destroyed,- it is manifestly clear 
at by sheer strategy the Japanese 
rces in Mindanao have been robbed 
their thunder, the spokesman 
iclared. "General MacArthur, by a 
ries of brilliant and successfully 
:ecuted military strokes, deprived 
Le enemy of their striking power 
'en for defensive purposes. It does 
)t call for a keen military mind to 
)te that General MacArthur has out- 
aneuvered and out>generalled Yam- 
;hita everywhere in the Philippines. 

"With the latest landings, he con- 
nued, "the battle for the Visayan 
jgion is practically won. This accom- 
ished, should it prove that there is 

strong concentration of Japanese 
irces in Mindanao, the main strength 
! the 8th Army would be made avail- 
)le to crfish the remnants of Yama- 
lita's contingents in that big island. 
11 in all, it is clearly evident that 
ie situation of the Japanese forces in 
ie Visayas and Mindanao is unten- 
3le, and their annihilation just a 
atter of time." 



Chinese Push Forward 
In Northern Burma 

SOUTHEAST ASIA HQ— Chinese 
troops have captured Mongyai in 
Northern Burma, 53 miles southeast 
of Lashio, against light resistance. 
South of Mandalay, the Japanese 
used small numbers of tanks in night 
attacks on Allied positions near cap- 
tured Meiktila. Strong resistance to 
the Allies in Burma, however, was 
confined to local areas as disorgani- 
zation spread through the enemy 
forces. * 



J. S. Navy Judged 
jig Enough Now 
"o Wipe Out Japs 

WASHINGTON — The American 
[avy as now constituted is apparent^ 
r considered by its commanders 
trong enough to complete the des- 
ruction of Japanese naval power 
rithout major new construction. 

The Navy has decided to build only 
2 escort carriers out of the 84 com- 
at ships that were projected in a 
uge construction program announced 
nly on March 6. Building of 84 addi- 
onal warships totaling 636,860 tons 
'as planned as "insurance" against 
ossible losses as the tempo of the 
aciric war increased. 

Tfie construction program was 
rafted with the understanding that 
; would be curtailed if the progress 
f the war showed the additional 
hips were not needed, according to 

Navy spokesman. -He added that 
ne factor in the decision was to 
lake the best use of manpower and 
laterials.

Pilot Lands On 
MaDila Street in 
Damaged Plane 

Skimming under wires strung 
across the street and landing on one 
of the busiest streets in Manila after 
their motor had been shot out by ene- 
my fire is an experience that Capt. 
Leslie A. Newman of San Antonio, 
Texas, and Lt. Charles W. Dugan of 
McConnelsville, Ohio, want to live 
through only once. 

In a recent action, the plane was 
struck by enemy ack-ack fire and 
immediately began to fall towards 
Jap-held territory. Lt. Dugan, the 
pilot, managed to right the light ar- 
tillery liaison plane and glide toward 
American lines. 

The only choice of a landing field 
was a crowded street. The plane 
nosed over one set of utility wires 
and then managed to slip under an- 
other, settled down on the street and 
stopped just short of a parked jeep, 
as thousands of breathless soldier 
and civilian spectators breathed a 
sigh of relief. 

NAMED FOR PROMOTION 

WASHINGTON— Lt. Gen. Alexan- 
der A. Vandergrift, commandant of

Russel Waesche, head of the Coast 
Guard, were nominated Thursday by

four-star rank. The president also 
named five rear admirals to be vice 
admirals, four commodores to be rear 
admirals and 20 captains to be com- 
modores.

Japanese Leave Burned Cebu 
As Another Scar of Occupation 



CEBU — Beautiful Cebu, second 
largest city in the Philippines, is a 
blackened wreck — another scar left 
by the ruthless Japanese, who put 
the torch to the city Monday as the 
Americal division landed on. Cebu 
island. 

Already damaged by three years 
of war, the once proud city of 150,000 
began to explode and burn as Jap- 
anese demolition squads went method- 
ically about their work of destruc- 
tion. A press dispatch said the first 
big fire flamed up in the center of 
the city at the very moment the first 
wave of American troops landed near 
Talisay, five miles south of Cebu 
city. 

Then came a big explosion followed 
by fires at the huge coconut oil re- 




finery across the harbor on Mac- 
au island. This was the biggest re- 
finery in the Philippines and had 
been used continuously by the enemy 
for production of vital oil, including 
motor lubricants. 

Among the installations in Cebu to 
which the Japanese applied the torch 
were the city electric plant, the ex- 
cellent dock facilities and the modern 
airfield northwest of the city. The 
press dispatch added: 

"The Japanese must have known 
that the Yanks were coming to Cebu. 
They had everything ready for a 
long, tough fight. Elaborate and 
extensive beach defenses had been 
thrown up. Tank traps and road 
blocks were established at important 
junction points on the main paved 
highway. Land mines and barbed 
wire entaglements guarded long 
"stretches of the beach. 

"But it takes more than that to 
stop these jungle trained vete- 
rans. Although the amphibious buf- 
falos that carried the assault waves 
were pinned down on the beach, the 
Americans piled out and started driv- 
ing inland against disorganized resis- 
tance. 

"When the first buffalos snorted 
out of the water and up on the 
sandy beach, the Japanese opened up 
with mortars. It bothered the Yanks 
lor a short time, but the enemy fire 
slackened when spotter planes ho- 
vered over the area watching for the 
bursts of fire. The Yanks moved 
inland, while the enemy fell back, 
finally blowing up the three-span 
highway bridge across the Mananga

EDITORIAL 

THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING 

N c %t Sunday, which promised to be the most exciting day in Manila 
Bincc American troops entered the city, is noio apparently going to be oust 
one mare Easter Sunday. For traffic won't begin, to move on the right 
havd Hide of the street until June J, The original date for the switch from 
left to right has been postponed from April 1. 

There is of course, plenty of argument for changing traffic from 
the left to the right side of the street. Ninety-eight per cent of all mo- 
tor vehicles now moving on Philippine highways and byivays belong to the 
United States Army* They are driven by Americans accustmncd to going 
to the rigid, and they have steering wheels designed for right hand driving. 

However, a good many Filipino cocheros t some care ton drivers and a 
limited number of chauffeurs have never driven on the right. Bui 
presumably they'll learn how it's done in a hurry, once the new rule goes 
into effect If they don't, they'll find themselves on the losing end of an 
argument with an Army truck. 

For the roughly 17,000,000 Filipinos who are pedestrians, either by 
ImJ'it or as a result of the acquisitive propensities of the Japs, the nev 
traffic regulations won*t make much difference. Pedestrians in the Phil

Temporary City Halt 
Set Up at Manna U. 

Three buildings of the Manila 
University are being used as a tem-

The buildings house the treasurer's 
office, accounting division, license

sion, register of deeds, and the city 
engineer's office. There is also a re- 
presentative of the auditor's office in 
the city hall to audit for the insular 
government all vouchers prepared by 
the accounting before payment. 

The city hall is usually full of peo- 
ple buying residence certificates 
(KGQ), internal revenue and docu-

are issued, only official receipts for 
the payment. The stamps are at

hi order to make the work of the ' 
price control agents easier and for 
the convenience of the general public, 
Col. Jones has ordered his men to 
require all vendors in the public mar- 
kets to put tags on their goods bear- 
ing the official prices. Vendors vio- 
lating this order will be punished ac- 
cordingly. Colonel Jones said that 
ignorance of the official prices of 
prime commodities on the part of 
vendors will not exempt them from 
punishment, 

"Arrest and punishment of profi- 
teers and ceiling price violators will 
continue as long as the black market 
exists in Manila," Chief Jones added,

GUAM — American carrier planes 
sank or damaged 46 Japanese ships 
and destroyed 87 airplanes Thursday

German Army 
Colla pses On 
West Front 

PARIS— The U. S. First and Third 
armies linked up Saturday at War- 
burg to seal off the vital Ruhr in- 
dustrial region from the rest of Ger- 
many, as the crumbling Nazi war 
machine showed positive signs of com- 
plete collapse. 

The First and Third armies met at 
a point only 175 miles from Berlin. 
To the north, great striking forces of 
more than 3,000 tanks from the Amer- 
ican First and British Second armies 
rampaged through Germany almost 
without opposition. 

Meanwhile the American Third 
army pushed down the last five miles 
toward Kassel 165 miles southwest of 
Berlin, The U. S. Seventh army 
fought within 15 miles of Wuerzbach, 
and the First French army plunged 
across the Rhine at a point between 
Mannheim and Karlsruhe* 

It was also disclosed that the U, S. 
Fifteenth army has joined the big 
push, thus bringing to nine the total 
number of Allied armies striking from 
the west. The Fifteenth took over 
an unspecified sector, 

Nazi resistance was light all along 
the line except in the south, where 
the Seventh army ran into stiff oppo- 
sition. Correspondents reported the 
U* S« First army had begun slowing 
its racing tank columns to consoli- 
date their tremendous gains. The 
tired, dust-begrimed tankmen badly 
needed rest after six days of all-out 
offensive battle. 

On the eastern front seven Russian 
armies continued to batter the reeling 
enemy in a half-dozen major sectors, 
posed a new threat to Vienna, now

3-Year Japanese 
incfo-Chjna Failure 

NEW YOBK — The failure of the 
Japanese to gain political control of 
Indo-China in the three years of occu- 
pation ia brought out in a recent book 
on that country by Hang Kohn, poli- 
tical science professor at Smith Col- 
lege. 

A recent Tokyo broadcast heard in 
the United States admitted that 
both the French and Annajneae refuse 
to obey the Japanese army, and that 
the French decline to turn over their 
firearms, cameras and radios, 

Kohn'g book points out that Indo- 
China i$ gaining in world interest due 
to its strategic geographical position, 
particularly Camranh bay which is an 
ideal site for a naval base nearly 
equidistant from Singapore, Hongkong 
and Manila.

JAP DIPLOMATS CONFINED 

™^ EN0S ^ m , ES ~ p **s dis- 
patches report that the Argentine 
government has notified the Japanese 
ambassador and 11 members of the 
embassy to remain in their homes 
pending decision on their internment. 
Aigentina declared war on Japan and 
Germany^ on Tuesday, 



of approximately 2,000 men in Ne- 
gros. When the Japanese turned 
toward the island, the entire force 
declared there would be no surren- 
der. But when the Japanese prepar- 
ed to invade, a number of officers 
lost heart and submitted to the 
enemy f taking with them their unwill- 
ing men. 

About 1,000 of the original force 
withdrew to the mountains and hills 
and prepared to meet the enemy with 
their mainly obsolete rifles and guns. 

Before unified command and dis- 
cipline were established, these "free" 
men deteriorated into roving bands 
not too far removed from bandits. 
Ihen civil government came in the 
person of Montelibano, the first mayor 
of Bacolod, 

When the Japanese invaded Ne- 
gros they pressed him to he the is- 
land governor When he waa unable 
to put off the Japanese demands 
any longer, Montelibano took his 
whole family to the mountains, He 
served as military governor of Ne- 
gros until Ma j. Jesus Viliamor came 
and a civil government was formally 
established with Montelibano as gov- 
ernor. The military command, which 
Viliamor he d for a time, was turn- 
ed over to Abccde when Viliamor left. 

The very heart and blood of the 
movement wag the prestige of Mon- 
telibano, and the Japanese leaders 
tried in every way to induce him to 
come down from the hills. They pro- 
mised him office. They would stage 
f Parade himv They would shoot 
£m ^7 th > ey had th ^elves in- 
structed to s ap and humiliate him 
before he took to the mountains. 

They would do scything: f or him. 
ihe Japanese commander, Col". Yama^ 
cruchi sent him fish in ice to remTnd 

me in the towns below. The colonel 
sent toys for his children/ 

tuxe" R.f^f " minister of agricul- 
SF& r?S_ ael Alunan, an old friend 
of Montelibano, was sent to persuade 
hjmto come down, Alunan and Mon 



tions had been set up from one end 
of the island to the other. Opera- 
tives were sent to every corner of 
the Philippines to gather information 
regarding the enemy r his movements 
his number, his installations. During 
the battle of Saipan, Negros flashed 
to the American fleet the strength 
and movements of the Japanese ships, 
and for this service received a cita- 
tion from Admiral Chester W, Ni 
mitz. 

And down from the mountains came i wwhjwv. weriuoiting ^

MaViila University 
Set to Reopen on 
deceiving Permit 

The University of Manila will re- 
sume classes as soon as a permit is 
obtained, according to Mariano V. de 
los Santos, prewar president of the 
University. 

"We are completely equipped to 
reorganize classes immediately," he 
said in an interview Saturday. "All 
our records, including those in the 
branches in Tondo and Intramuros, 
are intact. I think we have enough 
paper supplies. Ninety per cent of 
our library and text books have been 
carefully stored away." 

He plans to call a meeting of the 
university rectors and faculty early 
this week. As soon as city govern- 
ment offices temporarily housed in 
the main building of the university 
can be moved, the faculty will begin 
organizing classes from kindergarten 
up to the college courses. 

Miss Concepcion Aguila, executive 
directress of the Centro Escolar Uni- 
versity, said that a permit has al- 
ready been granted to organize 
classes and begin instruction as soon 
as possible. Enrollment in the kin- 
dergarten and elementary classes 
will begin in a few days. Most of 
the school's laboratory setup has 
been disorganized by occupation of 
part of the main building by the of- 
fices of the division of private edu- 
cation. As a result, complete college 
courses cannot be offered yet. College 
secretarial and cultural courses are 
under consideration. 

There will be a faculty meeting 
Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. at the main 
building at Mendiola to discuss plans 
for opening classes. 

Liquor Licensing 
Effective Here Today 

All liquors offered for sale by 
bars, night clubs and restaurants 
must be licensed beginning today 
Col. M. E.' Jones, chief of police 
of Greater Manila, announced yester- 
day. 

Licenses may be obtained upon ap- 
plication with the corresponding of- 
fice at G08 Quiricada street. Appli- 
cations, however, will be subject to 
investigation by the office of the pro- 
vost marshal. 

Col'. Jones stated that the cam- 
paign againat the sale of bootleg 
beverages has been satisfactory. No 
soldier had died from poison liquor 
during the last five days.

The Makapili survivor said that he 
and eight others were ordered by the 
Japs to transfer ammunition to a se- 
cret dump in Barrio Bulaburan. As 
soon as the ammunition has been 
moved, the Japs tied up then: Ma- 
kapili helpers and marched them to a

Ration's Armor Striking 
Within 162 Miles Of Berlin 

Paris — Elements of the American First and Ninth armies linked up 
Sunday at Lipstadt, 75 miles east of the Rhine, and 18 miles west of Pader- 
born, where other First Army units engaged in their first pitched battle 
with the Germans since breaking out of the Remagen bridgehead. 

Meanwhile, the British Second^ 
Army was reported almost a hundred 
miles east of the Rhine, and, at the 
southern end of the long western 
front, the American Seventh Army 
has driven to the Main River only 45 
miles from Nuremburg and 100 miles 
from the Czechoslovakian border. 

The juncture of the First and 
Ninth Armies, together with the Bri- 
tish Second Army drive into the 
Westphalian plain, theatened to cut 
off Germany's last major war pro- 
duction area in the Ruhr, and to en- 
circle an estimated 40,000 Nazi 
troops. In an effort to prevent this, 
the Germans made their stand in 
Kassel and Paderborn, moving rein- 
forcements into this area as rapidly 
as possible from the Ruhr and the 
Netherlands. 

Despite this desperate resistance, 
the American Third Army punched 
out gains up to 21 miles, and one 
armored column battled its way up 
the Frankfurt-Berlin highway within 
8 miles of the communications center 
of Eisennach and only 162 miles from 
Berlin.

Powerful B-20 
Fleet Blasts 
Tokyo Again 

Guam — American B-29's in consi- 
derable force returned early yester- 
day to pound again military targets in 
the Tokyo area. 

A press dispatch reported that pro- 
bably as many as 150 of the giant 
planes took off from their bases in 
the Marianas for the latest mission 
over the heart of Japan, only a few 
hours after American forces landed 
on Okinawa Island in the Ryukyus 
325 miles south of the homeland. 

A preliminary announcement said 
that a "large task force" made up 
the raiding fleet, which struck in the 
early morning hours of April 2, Jap- 
anese time. 

Further details will be announced 
after the planes return to their baefca. 



Opposition 

Guam — Veteran American 
Army and Marine divisions of 
the new Tenth Army surged 
ashore Easter Sunday on Okina- 
wa Island in the Ryukyus, only 
325 miles from the Japanese 
homeland. 

Supported by a naval force of 1,400 
ships, which bombarded the island for 
ten days, while carrier planes were 
pounding it from the air, the Tenth 
Army troops hit the beaches at 8:30 
AM. 

The landing was almost bloodless, 
and was the first battle for a beach- 
head on a vital Japanese island that 
has not been drenched with blood. 

Admiral Chester W. Nimitz said 
that after two and a half hours of 
rapid advance against surprisingly 
light opposition, the Americans cap- 
tured Yountan and Caida airport9 
with light losses. He added that the 
Tenth Army, whose principal ground 
elements include the 24th Army Corps 
and the Marine Third Amphibious 
Corps, made the invasion "in great 
force." 

A press dispatch said that 100,000 
Yanks probably stormed ashore, sup- 
ported by ships and landing craft of 
the Fifth Fleet, with the fleet's guns 
and aircraft. The attack on Okinawa 
also has been covered and supported 
by a strong British carrier task force. 

Nimitz announced that ..Admiral 
Spruance, Fifth Fleet commander, 
was in overall tactical command, 
while the amphibious phase was un- 
der command of Vice Admiral Ri- 
chard Kelly Turner and the Tenth 
Army is under command of Lt. Gen. 
Simon Bolivar Buckner. Maj. Gen. 
John R. Hodge commands the 24th 
Army Corps and Maj. Gen. Roy Gei- 
ger the Marines. 

At least a dozen towns and villages 
fell to the Americans in the early 
stages of the Okinawa invasion. One 
correspondent said the Americans 
went ashore along 0,000 yards of 
beach seven to ten miles north of 
Naha, the capital of Okinawa, land- 
ing virtually without casualties. An 
hour after the landing, the Japanese 
hurled some mortar and artillery fire 
against the beaches. These guns were 
quickly silenced. Troops had pushed 
inland as far as 3,500 yards by noon. 



105 Employees Of* 
High Commissioner 
To Get Back Pay 

One hundred five Amcricun "and 
Filipino employees of the office of 
the high commissioner will receive 
their salaries from December 7, 1941 
to the present time, Victor Baltazar, 
statistical clerk, said Saturday. 

Before payment is made every em- 
ployee is required to furnish the of- 
fice with a sworn statement about his 
activities during the Jap occupation. 
The employee's good conduct and 
loyalty to America will be taken into 
consideration in the payment of back 
salaries, Baltazar added. Any em- 
ployee who is under investigation by 
the CIC cannot get his pay until the 
investigating officer has cleared him, 
Of the 105 employees 84 are 
Filipinos and 21 are Americans. The 
payroll for the American employees 
is prepared, only awaiting confirma- 
tion from the office of the high com- 
missioner in Washington, Baltazar 
said only a few American employees 
will get their pay here because the 
majority of them have been repatriat- 
ed to the United States. The Filipino 
employees will receive their salaries 
about the middle of this month. 
Paul Steintorf, American consul gen- 
eral in the Philippines whose office 
is on 1570 Calle Arlegui, near Mala- 
canan, has been authorized by Richard 
R ; Ely, executive assistant of the 
high commissioner in Washington, to 
make the payment 

Baltazar said *the salary for the 
fiscal year 1943 will be paid first and 
the rest later.

J. S. Made Fake Jap Bills Among Pesos 
i Use On Negros During Occupation 



tfegros had four kinds of money, 
hiding false Jap pesos printed by 
United States, during the Jap- 
ise occupation of the island, ac- 
ding to Jesus Montes, intelligence 
native for Gov. Siquijor Alfredo 
ntelibano of Negros. 
rhere was the "genuine" Philip- 
ie currency in use at the outbreak 
the war. These pesos were hoarded 
the people in anticipation of liber- 
on. There were the emergency 
tes issued under the authority of 
> president of the Commonwealth, 
i which the Japanese offered to ex- 
ange for their own invasion money. 
Later, when the Commonwealth 
vernment was established under 
)ntelibano, more emergency notes 



were issued under Commonwealth 
authorization from Washington. 
These notes bore the promise of re- 
demption at the termination of the 
emergency. Possession of these notes, 
if discovered by the Japanese, meant 
death. For the first two years of 
the Japanese occupation, few would 
touch the notes. 

At one time they were offered in 
exchange for Japanese notes at 
slightly below par. Japanese money 
was needed by the Commonwealth 
government in the mountains to pur- 
chase food and supplies. These emer- 
gency notes, as distinct from the 
notes issued by the Commonwealth 
after the outbreak of the war but be- 
fore the Japanese invasion of the is- 



tew Government Bank To Have 
>pital Of 30 Million Pesos 



Speaking to a public assembly at 
e Lotus Theatre Sunday, Secretary 

the Interior Tomas Confesor ap- 
aled to Filipinos to be patient with 
eir government and not to expect 
trades in two months. 
Discussing plans for rebuilding the 
mmonwealth's economy, he announ- 
d that the new bank to be opened 

a few days will have a capital 

F30,000,000. 

Confesor pointed out that the Jap- 



Manilans Warn 
f Hasty Decision 
n Independence 

Two Manila residents, Jose G. Vi- 
uiueva of PCAU 21 and Mrs. Pedro 
. Blanco, Commonwealth advocate, 
is week added their voices to those 
•unseling Filipinos to consider all 
Lctors before urging independence as 
ion as possible regardless of hard- 
dps. . M . 
Villanueva cited "the tragic fate 
tat can befall an independent coun- 
ty without adequate means of de- 
>nse" in answer to absolute indepen- 
snce without any guarantee on the 
art of America. He favored, instead, 
lat the Philippines become the 49th 
;ate of the United States, a proposal 
hich has received no official endor- 
mieni 

Mrs. Blanco stressed the extreme 
eed of re-examining the Philippine 
uestion in the light of general world 
Dnditions. She urged that the ques 
ion of independence be decided "in 
uch a way that the generations yet 
nborn will be happy and contented 
nder the flag <*f progress and pros- 
erity." 

ielp of Filipino Unit 
^raised by U. S. Officer 

High praise for their help, starti- 
ng with the night the American First 
)avalry brigade reached Manila, was 
•aid by the American executive of- 
icer to the men of Company A, First 
.attalion, USPIF, Manila division, 
Jol. Dan Barrion commanding. 

"The men were of great assistance 
he night we arrived in Manila," Lt. 
3ol. Charles Brady said in a personal 
ommendation of the Filipino unit. 
'Their daring and courage are a cre- 
Capt. Dequena 



anese took almost eveything. "He 
enthroned graft, corruption and im- 
morality dn the government and in all 
phases of our national life. We can- 
not, in 60 days, cure the evils the 
enemy has planted to poison... our 
people." 

The people had lost their confi- 
dence in government during the last 
three years, Confesor said. That con- 
fidence is being slowly but surely re- 
stored to them. In Nueva Ecija, Bu- 
lacan, Cavite and Manila the govern- 
ment has been reorganized. "Very 
soon we shall be inaugurating the 
government in Pampanga, in Pangasi- 
nan, in La Union, in Rizal and in 
Bataan and Zambales. Very soon, too, 
the civil government in the provinces 
of Iloilo, Capiz, Antique, Romblon, 
Negros, Cebu and those in Mindanao, 
will be rehabilitated." 

In a few days, Confesor announced, 
the Commonwealth will open a gov- 
ernment bank with a capital of F30,- 
000,000 to provide banking facilities 
for commerce, industry, agriculture 
and trade." Private banks are ex- 
pected to open "very soon." The gov- 
ernment has filed a requisition with 
the United States Government for 
supplies and equipment of immediate 
necessity. "We have also requested 
for the assignment of five vessels un- 
der Philippine registry" to bring 
these supplies and equipment here as 
well as to take Philippine products to 
the American market. A requisition 
will soon be submitted for the reha- 
bilitation of the major industries such 
,as mining, lumber, sugar, cordage, 
rice milling, soap, shoe and textile 
manufacture, and for transportation 
and light and building facilities. 

The Philippine Army is being reor- 
ganized, under a program that would 
give recognition and reward to legi- 
timate guerrilleros. A national police 
force is also being organized. "Upon 
the appointment of the Chief of Police 
for the City in the person of Colonel 
Jones, I told him that he should be 
ruthless in purging the organization 
of its undesirable elements. By all 
indications, he is mustering out of the 
service the unreliable elements .... I 
want to assure you that more dis- 
missals are forthcoming." 

The public health service is being 
organized under American Army ex- 
perts, Confesor said. A plan for a 
greater, better Manila, free from 
slums, with a complete sewage system, 



land, were printed tn typewriting 

and wrapping paper. The 100 and 500 
peso bills were signed in ink by the 
governor. 

In addition, there were military 
notes issued by the Japanese 
which became almost worthless soon 
after the Americans landed on Leyte. 
The people resorted almost univer- 
sally to barter. Salt was exchanged 
for eggs, old clothes for chicken, 
shoes for rice. 

As the Japanese notes lost value, 
the emergency notes of the resistance 
government rose. When one tried to 
make a purchase, the vendor's first 
question was what kind of money the 
buyer had. If it was emergency cur- 
rency, the sale was quickly effected, 
if Japanese notes, the vendor had 
nothing to sell. 

Aside from the "genuine" Philip- 
pine currency, the emergency notes 
and the regular Japanese notes, Ne- 
gros also had "Japanese notes" 
printed by the United States. These 
were brought to the island by sub- 
marine for use by intelligence opera- 
tives. The Japanese soon learned of 
the trick, and the notes, printed on 
slightly thinner paper and detectable 
by expects, became "hot." 

The Japanese in Luzon apparently 
knew nothing of this "Japanese" mon- 
ey for the notes were used freely 
all over Luzon and in Manila by Ne- 
gros intelligence operatives until the 
American landing on Lingayen. 



Wounded Iwo 
Marines Get 
Purple Heart 

Pearl Harbor — The greatest num- 
ber of Purple Heart medals ever 
awarded at , a single ceremony were 
presented to 1,542 Marine veterans of 
Iwo Jima at the Naval Hospital here 
last week, states a New York Timei 
dispatch. 

Hundreds of the men who served 
with the Third, Fourth, and Fifth 
Marine Divisions received their 
awards while they lay in bed, while 
others were decorated at an outdoor 
ceremony. 

Vice Admiral John H. Towers de- 
puty commander of the Pacific Fleet 
made the presentation address, saying, 
"We are honoring you, who by your 
courage and sacrifices, have given the 
nation a great victory, and the fight- 
ing Marines an even greater tradi- 
tion. You have brought the war closer 
to Japan and penetrated the inner de- 
fenses of the enemy empire. You have 
hastened the end of the war." 

It ,was expected that approximate- 
ly 3,000 Marines would have been de- 
corated at the ceremony, but several 
hundred wounded had already return- 
ed to the mainland for tr2atment.

SETTING THE STAGE 

The stage is rapidly being set for the invasion of Japan. ^ Mo P^ n ^Ji 
i$ proceeding far ahead of schedule in the Philippines. American bomber* 
are beginning to give Japanese industrial centers the same relentless pouna- 
ing that led to the collapse of German armament production. The tentn 
Ar?ny has landed in the Ofcinawas, only SB5 miles from th* mainland or 
Japan. 

When and how the invasion of Japati will be launched must remain, of 
course, a military secret. But there is not a single person in this theater, 
either military or civilian, who is not vitally interested in the coming as- 
sault on Japan proper. 

The Philippines, through the logic of geography, must be the great base 
from which Japanese military might is destroyed. Here, in the heart of the 
Orient r are 17,000,000 people on a strategically located chain of islands t 
imbued with an impelling desire to contribute to the defeat of Japan- Here 
are two great American armies, tempered by the toughest fighting in the 
world, superbly equipped for combat t led by commanders who have met and 
defeated the largest Japanese armies every committed to battle. To the 
pulse-quickening hum of martial music, tlie Philippines once more prepares 
to play a leading role on the stage of history. 



Confesor Says Filipino Faith 
In America Never Failed 



During the last three years. Fill* 
pi not Jived under a regime of brutal- 
ity and terror, nevertheless their 
faith in American victory and their 
own eventful freedom never failed, 
declared Secretary of Interior Tomas 
Confesor at the Lotus Theater Easter 
Sunday in a popular meeting held 
under the auspices of the Manila Civ- 
ilian Anti-Japanese Association, 

The Filipinos owe America an ever- 
lasting debt of gratitude for their li- 
beration from the Japanese, said 
Secrtary Confesor, Of the American 
soldier, Confesor said that he has not 
only restored democracy to the Phil- 
ippines, he is "the real ambassador 
of goodwill" to Filipinos. "Through 
the American soldier today we feel 
the heartbeat of the American peo- 
ple." 

Confesor pointed out that America 
is not only fighting for the Philip- 
pines, "she provides us with food, 
>?Iothin^ medicines, and even shelter. 
She repairs our roads. She recons- 
tructs our bridges. . . She builds hos- 
pitals for the sick and the wounded, 
She provides relief for our homeless 
and indigents." 9 

Today, Confesor noted, "We do not 
see the poor picking crumbs from 
garbage cans, the left-over from the 
floor of restaurants. as they did 



during the enemy regime, while those 
who were engaged in the buy-and-sell 
business wallowed in millions and 
luxury. You are not today eating 
dogs, cats and rats as many of you 
did three months ago, while the buy- 
and-sell" people, the puppets, the col- 
laborators and the spies were enjoy- 
ing ham and eggs, tenderloin steaks, 
and luscious adobo," 

In conclusion Secretary Confesor 
attacked those who had collaborated 
with the Japanese for seeking to re- 
main in office and power after serv- 
ing the enemy. Regarding the argu- 
ment that the Japanese would have 
done worse to the country had these 
men not aken office under the Jap- 
anese, Confesor asked if the Jap- 
anese could have done worse than 
what they actually did, "These enemy 
collaborators at one time wanted us 
to surrender and take our oath of 
allegiance to the puppet republic in 
the name of national solidarity.,, 
issued to us threats of destruction 
and death by enemy guns and bombs 
in the name of national solidarity. 
Now they are using the same battle- 
cry of national solidarity" to regain 
public office, Confesor declared, "If 
I were in their place, my sense of 
personal decency would compel me to 
stay home and accept defeat/'

Japan's Island Position 
Is Now Her Weakness 

Guam — What was once Japan's 
strength is now her weakness and 
she has become "just an island nation 
well isolated," according to a press 
dispatch from this Pacific fleet head- 
quarters. 

The dispatch pointed out that once 
"she had a big navy to protect her 
shipping lanes from her stolen empire, 
But now she is just an island nation 
without any navy and wtih the entire 
homeland within range of our heavy 
bombers and carriers/* 

As an example of the increased j 
tempo of the American attack, the 
dispatch added "fleet headquarters are 
hardly settled here at Guam after a 
4,000-mjJe move westward from Pearl 
Harbor and today the action is 1,200 
miles from headquarters."

110,000 NAZI TROOPS ENCIRCLED 
BY 1st AND 9th ARMIES IN RUHR 



Paris — Press dispatches late yes- 
terday reported that 110,000 German 
trooos are encircled by the American 
First and Ninth armies in the vital 
Ruhr basin, and the Ninth has pushed 
well beyond the Ruhr 100 miles east 
of the Rhine. 

To the south, the American Third 
army crashed into Kassel and Fulda 
and drove within 155 miles of Berlin, 
while still farther south, the Amer- 
ican Seventh Army battled its way 
within 45 miles of Nuremburg. 

Meanwhile, Field Marshal Montgo- 
mery lifted the security blackout on 
news which has veiled the movements 
of his British Second Army since 
March 28, to disclose that the Second's 
eastern surge has engulfed the West- 
phalian city of Muenster, and carried 
it ahead to the outskirts of Lcngerich. 



20 miles to the northeast. This drive 
is threatening the whole German army 
group in Holland with encirclement. 

German troops pocketed in the 
Ruhr opened their first coordinated 
drive to break out between Paderborn 
and Siegen, but the Americans were 
standing firm. The German army 
groups in Holland and the Ruhr are 
estimated to comprise two thirds of 
the German strength on the western 

front. 

THOUSANDS ATTEND MASSES 

Vatican City — Thousands of Allied 
troops — outnumbering Italians — at- 
tended two Easter masses, celebrated 
simultaneously Sunday, in the great

zilian Expeditionary Force and Amer- 
ican sailors. . 



4Ist Strikes 
Thirty Miles 
From Borneo 

The 41st Division of the 
Eighth Army has seized the 
southern tip of the Sulu Archi- 
pelago at Tawi Tawi, in a new, 
ightning-like amphibious blow 
200 miles south from Zamboan- 
ga, General MacArthur revealed 
;oday. 

Today's communique stated that 
this great harbor was the former 
naval base of the Japanese fleet in its 
activities in Southwest Pacific waters, 
and added that its seizure seriously 
jeopardizes the enemy's main position 
n the Sulu Archipelago at,Jolo. 

Two weeks of heavy aerial bombard- 
ment preceded the landings, which 
were made under cover of local naval 
and air support in conjunction with 
guerrilla forces. American losses were 
light. 

One amphibious force landed on 
Sanga Sanga Island at 9 A. M. Mon- 
day, and another force hit the beach 
on Bonago Island at 1 P. M. the same 
day. General MacArthur pointed out 
that the landings bring our forces 
within 30 miles of Borneo with its 
great oil and rubber resources. Both 
islands, with their airfields, are now 
secure/ There was no serious op- 
position. 

Reds Push Within 
20 Miles of Vienna 

Moscow — Soviet troops charged to 
within 20 miles of Vienna from the 
south Sunday, as other Russian forces 
advanced to a point 13 miles from 
Bratislava, eastern gateway to the 
Austrian capital. 

Marshal Stalin announced the cap- 
ture of a town 10 miles from the 
Yugoslav border, after the fall of the 
Hungarian stronghold of Sopron 
earlier.

raham Urges Sugar Industry 
d Avert Impending Shortage 

David E. Graham, assistant sugar administrator, declared yesterday 
t there will be a sugar shortage in the Philippines in 1946 unless some- 
!ig is done to save the tottering Philippine sugar industry, 
jr. Graham pointed out that the<| ■ 



iual local sugar consumption is 
30,000 piculs, but he will not be 
prised if less than one-third of 
t total is produced this year, 
[he Philippine Sugar Administra- 
a, whose offices are located in the 
stern wing of the Malacanang 
mnds, has invited cane planters 
3 mill operators who are now in 
L&fia to call and discuss with Ad- 
Q^halion officials ways and means 
rehabilitating the Philippine sugar 
lustry. On the bases of an initial 
rvey made by that office, there is 
tr not only that there will be sugar 
tttage in 1946 but that there will 
no stands for the year's crop unless 
3 industry's major problems are 
trough ly threshed out, 
Mr* Graham stated that there are 
ough sugar mills in operating Con- 
xion, or requiring only minor re- 
irs, to mill a normal Philippine 
ne crop. But there is not enough 
ne planted for the 1945-46 milling 
ason. Mr. Graham also expressed 
ar that planters might be tempted 
sut their canes to make into pa- 
\cha or worse to dispose of them in 
gar cane bundles. 
"To save and rehabilitate the m- 
istry," Mr, Graham concluded, "seed 
■ds should be prepared now so that 
)ints will be available later this 
jar for planting,"

Several 



Complaints Against 
Rationing Answered 

Answering individual complaints 
from some members against the ra- 
tioning system, PCAU 20 officials 
said that the distribution of commo- 
dities is in the nature of relief and 
members of community stores can- 
not expect to get their supplies every 
day* 

Distribution of goods depends upon 
the amount of supply and the num- 
ber of items available from time to 
time, and PCAU officials advise 
store customers that insufficient ra- 
tioning should not be interpreted as 
the channeling of the supplies to the 
black market by store owners.

Owe Lives To Care Of Filipnos 



Washington — Stating that they

for the bravery and loyalty of the 
Filipinos who assisted them, two 
American soldiers paid high tribute 
to those who attended their wounds 
after their rescue from the Japan-

Final Ruling on Collaboration 
Declared Up to U* S. Army 



ie American Chamber of Commerce 
uilding on Calle Espana. Several 
TSzxob are being held there be- 
KL? of" transportation difficulties. 
Ianv messages for business repres- 
Hves are undelivered because 
Srner addresses have been decoyed 
nd messengers have been unflble to 
Mjato present »ddre«a«i 



The final arbiter as to what con- 
stitutes collaboration is not the Com- 
monwealth government but United 
States military authorities, especially 
the Counter Intelligence Corps, ac- 
cording to Secretary Maximo Kalaw 
of the Department of Instruction and 
Information* 

Explaining the government's stand 
towards collaborationists, Kalaw 
said today: "The policy of the Com- 
monwealth with regards to the so- 
called collaborationists is based on 
the statement of President Roosevelt 
on Jan. 20, 1044, when he signed le- 
gislation passed by the American 
Congress, authorizing him to give 
independence to the Philippines 
ahead of 1946" 

Kalaw pointed out that one of the 
conditions imposed by Roosevelt is 
that all collaborators should be re- 
moved from authority and influence 
over the political and economic life of 
the country. 

The secretary said that this is not 
intended to include minor govern- 
ment employees who do not occupy 
key positions. He added that his de- 
partment has reinstated many such 
employees. 

"The majority of employees of the 
department of instruction at present 
are old employees of the department," 
Kalaw said. "So are the employees 
of the only office saved, the Archives 
division of the Philippine Library 
and Museum. All employees of the 
only branch of the University of the 
PhillDpMes which has been saved, the 



serum laboratory of Alabang, were 
old employees." 

In regard to government employees 
whose posts have been eliminated by 
the Japanese destruction, Kalaw 
said: "It will be the task of our 
Congress to decide what to do with 
them." 

"As to those holding key positions, 
experience has shown us that the CIC 
has been careful and even rigorous 
in its investigation," Kalaw said, He 
then cited the cases of a superinten- 
dent of schools and a principal of a 
province who were at first cleared by 
the CIC, and after two months were 
declared within the prohibition 
laid down by President Roosevelt and 
were suspended. Kalaw explained that 
his department has tried not to en- 
gage people who might afterwards be 
barred by the CIC* 

The secretary attacked the theory 
that civil service employees should 
automatically be retained in spite of 
a change of sovereignty as untenable, 
saying that it is absurd to maintain 
that their tenure of office will trans- 
cend the very life of the government 
they were supposed to serve and de- 
fend. 

"The Commonwealth was wiped 
out in the Philippines and they ac- 
cepted positions under the so-called 
republic," he declared, "In order to 
serve again in the Commonwealth, 
they must be reappointed. This is 
my contention and I will hold on to 
it until the Supreme Court decides 
othtrwta*.

kock was never taken prisoner, re- 
maining in the Philippine territory 
until September 1044 as a guerrilla 
leader. Ho was badly injured in th« 
arm by sniper bullets, and was treated 
by Loveto Sanches, Filipino nurse 
who had served with the Red Cross. 
Hickock said, "She tended my wounds 
so carefully there was no infection. 
That would have been a miracle even 
it home with sulfa drugs*" 

Pulice who was at Cabanatuan and 
at Bilibid prison until the Japanest 
sent him to Mindanao to work in the 
rice fields, declared: "The Filipinoi 
always tried to bring us stuff — food, 
cigarettes, soap— things they needed 
for themselves, but were willing to 
share with us. Sometimes they wer* 
caught and beaten but that didn't 
stop them." 

Pulice was aboard a transport be- 
ing taken from Mindanao when 
the ship was torpedoed, and 
dragged himself ashore with a shat- 
tered leg after 17 hours in shark- 
infested waters, dodging the Japanese, 
Filipino guerrillas came to his assist- 
ance and took him to two doctors in 
their group who operated and pre- 
vented an infection. 

Both soldiers expressed a desire to 
return to the Philippines* 



Anderson Guerillas 
Honor Slain Comrades 

Services were held last week at the 
Manila headquarters of the Anderson 
guerrillas in honor of three slain 
members: Captain Manuel Cabo Chan, 
commander of Blue* Eagle sector, 
Capt, Henry Power, Tampa Area, 
Pvt Alberto Roxas, Xampa Area P 

Commander Cabo Chan, who was 
among the first to initiate the resist- 
ance movement in Bulacan, was 
killed in Manila December, 1944, in 
an encounter with hostile elements. 

Captain Power was captured by the 
Jap military police and executed, 
while Private Roxas was digging a 
grave for a civilian casualty when he 
was hit by Jap sniper fire. 

Maj. Bernard L. Anderson, com- 
mander of the Anderson Guerrillas 
expressed deep regret over their 
deaths, stating that they did not die

3-Mile Beach 
On East Coast 
Now Secured 



Final Link 
Forged To Cut 
Jap Li 



the mo 



Manila— Japan's so called empire 
ifeiine to the East Indies has been 
severed, with the seizure of Tawi 
rawi, Gen. MacArthur declared today. 

At the same time, General Mac- 
Arthur announced that 40th Division 
:roops landed on Masbate, joined with 
guerrillas forces and are rapidly se- 
curing the entire island. There was 
Little opposition. - . 

The 41st Division's lightning-like 
blow and its capture of the southern 
tip of the Sulu Archipelago Monday, 
forged the last link in the chain of 
blockading airfields which Wie re- 
capture of the Philippines has made 
possible, he said in today's official 
communique, which added: 

"Along the entire coast, from the 
northern end of Luzon to the southern 
tip of the Sulu Archipelago, a dis- 
tance of more than a thousand -miles, 
our airfields flank the water of the 
South China Sea between the coast 
of Asia and the Philippines, while 
our fields stretching for 2,000 miles 
from New Guinea to the Philippines, 
cover the waters necessary for com- 
munication from Japan to Java, Bor- 
neo, Celebes, the Moluccas and all 
other islands of the Southwest Pa- 

C ^The communique pointed out that 
the width of the South China Sea 
averages only a few hundred miles, 
so that its expanse, as well as the 
coastline of the Asiatic mainland, is 
easily covered by our bombers in ad- 
dition to our submarines. 

The effectiveness of this blockade 
results from its great depth, permit- 
ting multiplicity of successive fields 
to bear upon the target, General Mac- 
Arthur explained, and pointed out 
that the enemy can easily, under 
favorable weather conditions, slip 
through waters covered only from one 
set of bases, but when he runs into 
successive belts flanked by fields ex- 
tending for thousands of miles, he 
finds it impossible to pierce the block- 

&d General MacArthur then disclosed 
that the Southwest Pacific campaign 
along the coast of New Guinea 
through the Halmaheras and through- 
out the length of the Phiippines, had 
this as one of its primary, strate- 
gic objectives. 

"The entire Dutch East Indies are 
now isolated, not only for exploita- 
tion, but from enemy reinforceirant 
and annu ly." the communique said.

Eisenhower Says Nazis In Ruhr 
Now "Ripe For Annihilation 9 

Paris The Fourth Armored Division of General Patton's Third Army 

has plunged 19 miles eastward into the outskirts of the old German city 
of Gotha— three fourths of the way ac ross the Reich toward Czechoslovakia 
and only 140 miles from Berlin. 



Other Third Army units were fight- 
ing from house to house and from 
street to street in the great Hessian 
manufacturing city of Kassel, an in- 
dustrial center with a population of 
217,000 people. 

At the same time, British and Ca- 
nadian troops advanced to within 
striking distance of the Zuider Zee 
and the North Sea in Holland. This 
drive is aimed at encircling the Ger- 
man forces in Holland, while Amer- 
ican forces tighten their trap on 
thousands of Nazis in the Ruhr, 

The situation yesterday on the 
western front, was: 

Canadian First Army— Drove into 
Holland toward the Zuider Zee. 

British Second Army— Aided by 
American troops, this army cleared 
two thirds of Muenster, entered Osna- 
bruek and battled to within 60 miles 
*f Bremen and Hannover. 

American Tenth Army — Monoid hp 



in Hamm, Ruhr rail center, captured 
other Ruhr towns, moved within 90 
miles of Hannover, city of 472,000 
people. 

American First Army — Closed the 
Ruhr trap as General Eisenhower an- 
nounced the encirclement complete, 
and said that German forces are "ripe 
for annihilation." 

American Third Army — Raced to 
outskirts of Gotha and are fighting 
inside Kassel. 

American Seventh Army — On the 
southern end of this front, this army 
pressed to within 32 miles of Stutt- 
gart, city of 460,000 and advanced 
within six miles of Heilbronn, a traf- 
fic center, and within 44 miles of 
Nuremburg. 

French First Army— Widened the 
Rhine bridgehead near Harksruhe to 
25 miles and seized 60 localities within 

48 VionrB 



Okinawa — The Japanese defending 
forces on this island have been split 
apart, and American forces which 
drove clear across Okinawa to reach 
the eastern coast at two places now 
hold about three miles of the eastern 
beaches. 

Veteran elements of the Tenth 
Army reached the eastern coast near 
Tobara Monday, and Tuesday other 
units drove through to capture the 
coastal town of Awashi, about a mile 
and a half southeast of Tobara. 

Meanwhile, the Americans are 
probing forward out of the Awashida 
Peninsula. Units on the southern 
flank also were advancing against 
moderate resistance, and were still 
ahead of their time schedule. 

The drive across the island secured 
for the American a foothold on all 
vital north-south communications, 
including roads, railroads and tele- 
phone lines. There is a narrow 
gauge railroad running from the 
west coast, formerly used to haul 
sugar cane. 

Marines at the northern end of the 
Tenth Army's western beach front 
broadened their hold to at least 10 
miles, and cleaned out and secured 
Zampa Cape. They sent an armored 
spearhead probing the coastal high- 
way to the north. 

Admiral Nimitz announced that 
Japanese activity was increasing in 
the center of Okinawa Island, and 
frontline dispatches indicated the 
enemy may be preparing to make a 
stand across the narrow, bottleneck 
isthmus guarding the approaches to 
the capital city of Naha and its huge, 
nearby airfields. Latest reports 
placed Americans within six miles of 
Naha, and said that the isthmus is 
aflame with shelling by warships and 
attacks by rocket firing dive bombers 
and fighters. 

American unloading operations, 
carried on under floodlights, were 
interrupted only twice during the 
night of April 2 and 3 by air raid 
alerts, and the Japanese shore artil- 
lery failed to molesfc the activity. 
Casualties continued to be light on 
both sides.

Chungking — United States Four-

Evidence of atrocities against civi 
lans in Manila by the Japanese mili- 
tary personnel was found by Amer- 
ican soldiers of the 129th Infantry 
Regiment during an attack at Fort 
Santiago and the Intramuros area 
south of the Fort on February 23 
and 24. This was revealed in official 
documents made public last Sunday- 

The evidence of those atrocities, re- 
suiting in the death of some 400 per- 
sons^ was found in three different 
places In Fort Santiago. Death had 
oeen caused by shooting, bayoneting I 
or starvation. The majority of the I 
bodies had their hands tied behind 
them. They had been dead for four 
ur nve days. 

Bodies were in such a position, that 
a group could have been faced against 
the wail and shot in the back. Then 
another group would be brought in 
do suffer a like fate, with their bodies 
filing over those of the first group, 
The bodies weie shrunken, giving evi- 
Uence of malnutrition and near-star- 
vation. 

Among another group of bodies i 
found wcrejh ree Jive civilian Fiiipi- 



I nog. One of them said that 
of a group of 68 tubercular

Jap Lifeline 

Manila— Japan's so called empire 
feline to the East Indies has been 
evered with the seizure of Tawi 
'awi, Gen. MacArthur declared today. 

At the same time, General Mac- 
irthur announced that 40th Division 
roops landed on Masbate, joined with 
uerrillas forces and are rapidly se- 
uring the entire island. There was 
ttle opposition. 

The 41st Division's lightning-like 
low and its capture of the southern 
ip of the Sulu Archipelago Monday, 
orged the last link in the chain of 
lockading airfields which Vie re- 
apture of the Philippines has made 
ossible, he said in today's official 
ommunique, which added: 

"Along the entire coast, from the 
orthern end of Luzon to the southern 
[p of the Sulu Archipelago, a dis- 
ance of more than a thousand miles, 
ur airfields flank the water of the 
louth China Sea between the coast 
f Asia and the Philippines, while 
ur fields stretching for 2,000 miles 
rom New Guinea to the Philippines, 
over the waters necessary for com- 
lunication from Japan to Java, Bor- 
eo, Celebes, the Moluccas and all 
ther islands of the Southwest Pa- 
ific." 

The communique pointed out that 
he width of the South China Sea 
verages only a few hundred miles, 
o that its expanse, as well as the 
oastline of the Asiatic mainland, is 
asily covered by our bombers in ad- 
lition to our submarines. 

The effectiveness of this blockade 
■esults from its great depth, permit- 
ing multiplicity of successive fields 
o bear upon the target, General Mac- 
iirthur explained, and pointed out 
hat the enemy can easily, under 
avorable weather conditions, slip 
hrough waters covered only from one 
let of bases, but when he runs into 
mccessive belts flanked by fields ex- 
ending for thousands of miles, he 
inds it impossible to pierce the block- 

ide. • , , 

General MacArthur then disclosed 
;hat the Southwest Pacific campaign 
ilong the coast of New Guinea 
irough the Halmaheras and through- 
5ut the length of the Philppines, had 
Jhis as one of its primary, strate- 
gic objectives. 

"The entire Dutch East Indies are 
now isolated, not only for exploita- 
tion, but from enemy reinforcement 
md supp ly " the communique said. 
rWO VILLAGES CAPTURED 

Calcutta — Southeast Asia Com- 
mand Headquarters announced that 
fourteenth Army troops occupied two 
rillages northwest of Thazi and con- 
iaued to mop up isolated pockets of

Eisenhower Says Nazis In Ruhr 
Now "Ripe For Annihilation" 

Paris— The Fourth Armored Division of General Patton's Third Army 
has plunged 19 miles eastward into the outskirts of the old German city 
of Gotha— three fourths of the way ac ross the Reich tow-ard Czechoslovakia 
and only 140 miles from Berlin. 



Other Third Army units were fight- 
ing from house to house and from 
street to street in the great Hessian 
manufacturing city of Kassel, an in- 
dustrial center with a population of 
217,000 people. 

At the same time, British and Ca- 
nadian troops advanced to within 
striking distance of the Zuider Zee 
and the North Sea in Holland. This 
drive is aimed at encircling the Ger- 
man forces in Holland, while Amer- 
ican forces tighten their trap on 
thousands of Nazis in the Ruhr. 

The situation yesterday on the 
western front, was: 

Canadian First Army — Drove into 
Holland toward the Zuider Zee. 

British Second Army — Aided by 
American troops, this army cleared 
two thirds of Muenster, entered Osna- 
bruek and battled to within 60 miles 
•f Bremen and Hannover, 

American Tenth Army — Mooned nv 



in Hamm, Ruhr rail center, captured 
other Ruhr towns, moved within 90 
miles of Hannover, city of 472,000 
people. 

American First Army — Closed the 
Ruhr trap as General Eisenhower an- 
nounced the encirclement complete, 
and said that German forces are "ripe 
for annihilation." 

American Third Army — Raced to 
outskirts of Gotha and are fighting 
inside Kassel. 

American Seventh Army— On the 
southern end of this front, this army 
pressed to within 32 miles of Stutt- 
gart, city of 460,000 and advanced 
within six miles of Heilbronn, a traf- 
fic center, and within 44 miles of 
Nuremburg. 

French First Army— Widened the 
Rhine bridgehead near Harksruhe to 
25 miles and seized 60 localities within 

48 hoiirfl 



3-Mile Beach 
On East Coast 
Now Secured 

Okinawa — The Japanese defending 
forces on this island have been sDlit 
apart, and American forces which 
drove clear across Okinawa to reach 
the eastern coast at two places now 
hold about three miles of the eastern 
beaches. 

Veteran elements of the Tenth 
Army reached the eastern coast near 
Tobara Monday, and Tuesday other 
units drove through to capturo the 
coastal town of Awashi, about a mile 
and a half southeast of Tobara, 

Meanwhile, the Americans are 
probing forward out of the Awashida 
Peninsula. Units on the southern 
flank also were advancing against 
moderate resistance, and were still 
ahead of their time schedule. 

The drive across the island secured 
for the American a foothold on all 
vital north-south communications, 
including roads, railroads and tele- 
phone lines. There is a narrow 
gauge raijroad running from the 
west coast, formerly used to haul 
sugar cane. 

Marines at the northern end of the 
Tenth Army's western beach front 
broadened their hold to at least 10 
miles, and cleaned out and secured 
Zampa Cape. They sent an armored 
spearhead probing the coastal high- 
way to the north. 

Admiral Nimitz announced that 
Japanese activity was increasing in 
the center of Okinawa Island, and 
frontline dispatches indicated the 
enemy may be preparing to make a 
stand across the narrow, bottleneck 
isthmus guarding the approaches to 
the capital city of Naha and its huge, 
nearby airfields. Latest reports 
placed Americans w T ithin six miles of 
Naha, and said that the isthmus is 
aflame with shelling by warships and 
attacks by rocket firing dive bombers 
and fighters. 

American unloading operations, 
carried on under floodlights, were 
interrupted only twice during the 
night of April 2 and 3 by air raid 
alerts, and the Japanese shore artil- 
lery failed to molesfc the activity. 
Casualties continued to be light on 
both sides. 



14th AirfoTce Fighters 
Bag 92 Japanese Planes 

Chungking — United States Four- 
teenth Air Force fighter planes des- 
troyed 92 Japanese aircraft and pro- 
bably destroyed one other in attacks 
on Shanghai airdrome Sunday and 
Monday. Of this number, six planes 
were shot down. 

American fighter planes also atraf- . 
ed the entire length of the Peining- 
Hankow railway while bombers hit the 
Hankow airdrome.

we are to give her certain bases in 
exchange for the mutual protection 
of the Philippines and the United 
States. Besides this guarantee there 
mil also be this proposed world or- 
ganization under a General Assembly 
of which we are a member and a se- 
curity council composed of the United 
States, China, England, Soviet Russia 
and ultimately France and six repre^ 
sentatives of smaller nations. This 
council will be given military powers 
to police the world. With these two 
securities— the American and the 
United. Nations organization— the 
eternal guarantee of Philippine inde- 
pendence will be secure/' Kalaw ex- 
plained* 

Secretary Kalaw pointed out that 
in the future world to he governed by 
:.he proposed United Nations organi- 
zation, the old idea of complete and 
absolute sovereignity and indepen 
dence, even for the greater nations 
win have to be modified. He said 
nations was that nations refused to 
that the fault of the old league of 
give up part of their cherished sov- 
ereignity and independence for the 
collective security of the world. 

"In the proposed scheme that will 
be taken up in San Francisco, great 
powers, including the United States, 
will have to yield some of their sover- 
eign rights, so that there can be a 
common pool of forces, to police the 
world/' Kalaw said.

BRIGHT FUTURE FOR 
PHILIPPINES PREDICTED 
BY FATHER HURLEY 

"The future of the Philippines 
was never so bright as it is now" 
Very Rev. Fr. John F. Hurley, 
bupenor of the Society of Jesus in 
the Philippines and Secretary-Gen^ 
era] of the Catholic Welfare Organi- 
zation declared in a radio speech over 
the Commonwealth Hour. 

"We have gone through our Good 
hriday, but on the horizon we descry 
a grand and glorious Easter Sunday 
dawning for our beloved Philip- 
pines," he said. 

"The men at the helm of the Com- 
monwealth face a gigantic task. But 
they can meet this situation provided 
that every loyal Filipino and every 
loyal organization In the Philippines 
rally to their support," Fr. Hurley 
stated. 

Fr. Hurley said that Most Reverend 
William Piani, Apostolic Delegate to 
the Philippines, after witnessing the 
misery and destruction caused by the 
war in the Philippines, organized the 
Catholic Welfare Organization, one 
of the largest organizations in the 
islands, to aid the stricken populace. 

Services of the Catholic Welfare 
Organization were offered to Gen. 
Douglas MacArthur. In accepting 
this offer, General MacArthur said 
that he fully realized that the Church 
had neither food nor medicine to 
offer that the Church could ren- 
der great service by offering 
its personnel and properties, to 
assist in every way possible the 
United States Army relief agencies 
and the Commonwealth Government 
in their present mission of bringing 
material relief to the people. 

f4 Chief function of the Catholic 
Welfare Organization," according to 
Fr. Hurley, "is to provide personnel 
and properties to assist the military , 
civil and relief authorities in their 
mighty task of rehabilitation, 

"The Catholic welfare organization 
is liaison between the Church and the 
Government. Its watchword and its 
spirit is cooperation with the United 
States Army "and the Commonwealth 
Government, all for one purpose — to 
promote the common good pi the 
whole people," Fi\ Hurley explained.

Disease Prevention 
Steps Being Taken 
By Health Officials 

As a preventive measure against 
dengue and malaria, the city health 
department is repairing the drainage 
system and has assigned workers to 
see to the proper draining of stag- 
nant water, 

A health official pointed out that 
Ftajinant water in public places is 
not the only breeding places of mos- 
quitos that carry these diseases, 
Stagnant water in backyards must 
Etlao be eliminated to exterminate this 
threat, he said. 

The health department has also 
taken measures to prevent dysentery, 
diarrhea, cholera and typhoid. Health 
employees have been sent to refugee 
camps to innoculate the refugees* 

The mass innoculation of civilians, 
according to Lt t Col. Lorenzo Parks, 
of the health department, could not 
be effected at present due to lack of 
serum. The Alabang laboratory 
under the Institute of Hygiene which 
produced this kind of serum for the 
government before the war, has not 
been in operation for some time and 
its stock of serums was all used up 
during the Japanese occupation. 

Lt Col. Parks said that the Ala- 
bang serum laboratory is beinjr put 
in operation and as soon as enough 
serum is produced, mass innoculation 
of city residents will be started, 

CABILI LAUDS GUERRILLAS

taining the complete record of the

Allies Drive To Weser and Emsj 
Kesselring Caught In Ruhr Trap 

Paris — Allied armies reached the 
Weser and Ems rivers yesterday, 
smashing through the German lines 
within 48 miles of the North Sea and 
only 38 miles from the great Prussian 
stronghold of Hannover. 

In the center of the western front, 
General Patton's Third Army burst 
out into the rolling Thuringian plain 
in the heart of Germany, long a battle 
ground of middle Europe. Patton's 
forces were more than 200 miles east 
of Germany's western frontier, and 
only 68 miles from Czechoslovakia. 

In the south, the Seventh Army, 
flanking the Black Forest, moved 
within 34 miles of Nuernberg, while 
French forces entered Karlsruhe, cap- 
ital of Baden. 

The great cities of Muenster, Osna- 

brueck, Kassel, Fulda, Aschaffenburg, 

Siegen, Gotha and Bruchsal all had 

fallen to the Allied armies. Wuerz- 

burg, Hamm, Engelp and Zutphen 

were under assault and ready to top- 
ple. Germany's North Sea ports and 

naval bases were seriously menaced. 
The German commander of Kassel 

formally surrendered the city at 12:80 



P.M. Thursday, and the Sixth Armor- 
ed Division pushed on four miles to 
near Oberdorla, 4 miles south- 
west of Muehlhausen. 

After attacking Osnabrueck, Field 
Marsshal Montgomery's forces pushed 
deeper into Germany under a security 
news blackout. At last reports they 
were racing toward the North Sea 
in an effort to trap thousands of 
Germans in Holland. Canadian troops 
were menacing Arnhcm and were 
within less than 20 miles of the Zui- 
der Zee, forming a trap within a trap 
and threatening hourly to intercept 
the V-bomb coast from which the 
Nazis bombard England. 

An Associated Press report said 
that Field Marshal Kesselring is 
among the thousands of Germans 
caught in the Ruhr trap by the First 
and Ninth Armies.

Ships, Docks 
Are Smashed 
In Heavy Raid 

General Mac Arthur 'a communique 
today reported smashing aerial blown 
against Hongkong and Formosa, with 
American heavy bombers unloading 
168 tons of thousand pound bombe 
on shipyards, waterfront installations 
and ships anchored in Hongkong har- 
bor with devastating effect 

Nine merchant vessels, one of them 
a 7,000 ton craft, were sunk in the 
Hongkong attack, while two other 
merchat ships and a destroyer were 
damaged. On shore, oil storage tanks 
were left burning and smoke was ris- 
ing 7,000 feet in the air as MacAr- 
thur's bombers left their targets. 
Enemy fighters attempting intercep- 
tion were driven off after a running 
fight, We did not lose a single plane. 

Bombers of all categories with 
fighter escort continued the neutral- 
izing raids that have so seriously 
crippled Formosa in the past month, 
by striking at targets in the Kagi 
area. Many parked planes were de- 
stroyed on the airdrome, direct hits 
were scored on fuel and alcohol fac- 
tories and widespread damaged caused 
to railroad installations and rolling 
stock. Fires were started in a rail- 
road workshop. Meanwhile, night pa- 
trols bombed Keeling and Shinchiku 
and our fighters shot down three 
enemy fighters south of Formosa. 

In the China Sea, the American air 
blockade wrecked two 1,000 ton 
freighters east pf Formosa, thuee 
smaller vessels off the China coast 
and a 2,000 ton freighter off the 
French Indo-China coast 

General MaeArthur's planes also 
bombed- rail and road targets on the 
Indo-China coast and his bridges and 
gun positions in North Hainan, We 
lost one plane. 

On Luzon, American advances Ln 
the central and southern sectors con- 
tinued, and in the Visayas, the Eighth 
Army continued to reduce enemy po- 
sitions on Negros and Cebu. General 
Mac Arthur announced that engineer 
units are engaged in extensive recons- 
truction at Cebu City and other 
enemy-devastated areas. 

An ammunition dump on Job Island 
was blown up by American bombers. 

On Borneo, heavy bombers hit Miri 
airdrome and started fires in the Ta- 
rakan oil storage area. 

Other aerial bombardment wrecked 
16 vessels off Celebes. The Kendari- 
Ambesia airfields, Ambnina, Ccrara 
and the Halm ah eras in the Moluccas, 
Soembawa and Fuiloro on Timor, We- 
wak on New Guinea and Rabaul, New 
Ireland and Bougainville in the Bis- 
marck-Solomons also were targets for

and night from the 4th to the tenth 
of February, caring for Bick and 
wounded refugees, he described the 
events beginning February 10, as fol- 
lows: 

"Suddenly Saturday afternoon, a 
squad of Japanese entered the Red 
.Cross building and began to shoot 
and bayonet everybody they found in 
the building. As we heard the noise 
of rifle fire in every section of the 
building, Miss Andayas (a volunteer 
nurse) screamed for mercy to spare 
the lives of a mother and child be- 
side her. Before we knew what hap- 
pened, a soldier with drawn bayonet 
came into the temporary combined 
office-operating room- ward where I 
was, and all of us, Dr. de Venecia, 
two nurses and an attendant, ducked 
into our respective corners for safety. 
First, Dr. de Venecia was shot twice 
while he was seated at his corner. 
The soldier next aimed at the refugee- 
attendant beside him, but missed her, 
She threw herself over to where the- 
two nurses had covered themselves 
with mattresses beside my desk, and 
saw two patients crouching under- 
neath. One bayonet thrust finished 
each one of them. Another bayonet 
thrust at the girl who had escaped 
the first shot aimed at her, caught 
one of the nurses. The Jap soldier 
shot a young mother with her ten day 
old baby along with the baby's grand- 
mother. That, for all the Japanese 
knew, finished all of us in the room." 

Mr. Farolan was saved when the 
bullet aimed by the soldier struck his 
helmet. He and the two nurses were 
saved. His story continues: 

"More shooting went on around the 
rest of the building. We could hear 
the victims in their death agony, the 
shrill cries of children and the sobs 
of dying mothers and girls. Wher 
the job was done, to the apparent sa- 
tisfaction of the murderers, we heard 
the pharmacy being ransacked, then 
some soldiers eating the meagre noon 
meal that had been spread on our 
table, but which we did not have time 
to eat. On my way from the office I 
found both dead and alive, the latter 
too scared to say that they were alive. 
In the ladies at toilet room, which 
had been used as a shelter by 10 
Jewish refugees, I went over several 
dead bodies, One of those still alive 
whispered to me that he thought eight 
of their number had been bayoneted 
or shot to death.' 1 

As Mr* Farolan left the building, 
he saw two girls and a boy shot to 
death by a Japanese sentry as they 
were trying to cross the street. AH 
told, some 60 refugees and patients 
were killed Jn the Red Croia Build- 
ing* 




NAZI AIRCRAFT CENTER

Moscow— Marshal Stalin announ 
eed yesterday that Russian troops 
have captured Wiener Neustadt, 
Messerschmidt assembly center 25 
miles south of Vienna. 

The Soviets previously had captur- 
ed Eisenstadt, Glcgnitz and Netinkir-

and cut the road from Vienna to 
Graz and Klagenfurt. Other Soviet 
forces were filtering into Bratislava, 
30 miles oast of Vienna,

Moscow said that lack of discarded 
enemy equipment showed that the 
Japanese have evacuated the high 
ground that almost anyone else would 
have defended prior to the American 
landings. Lack of contact with the 
main enemy force still leaves the Jap- 
anese strategy to be exposed, although 
an enemy stand may be made along 
a high ridge running from Naha, the 
island's principal town, to the east 
coast. 

But while the Japanese have aban- 
doned the territory, including the high 
ground dominating the island's main 
harbor, Nakagusuku Bay, on the east- 
ern shore, our forces immediately 
started converting this ground into a 
bastion from which our sorties at the

!ommon Man's Defiance Of Japs 
aved Philippines, Confesor Says 



Tomas Confesor, Secretary of the 
terior in the Philippine Common- 
jalth government, in a recent radio 
oadcast, declared that it was the 
mmon man and not the politicians 
id so-called economic moguls who 
ved the Philippines in this war. 
mfesor, governor of Iloilo province 
hen the Japanese invaded the Phil* 
pines, defied the enemy and refused 
collaborate with him. 
Secretary Confesor, when inter- 
ewed on the Philippine Hour, said: 
^ singular aspect of the # Filipinos' 
and in this war is that it was the 
mimon man who niade and carried 
it the decision to fight by the side 
J the United States. The so-called 
[tellectuals let us down. They 
)rmed the nucleus of the group of 
uppets and collaborators. If the 
)mmon man did not assert himself 
l this war, democracy in the Phil- 
>pines would have been lost. The 
oliticians and the so-called economic, 
loguls and barons lived comfortably 
uring the Japanese occupations. The 
amnion man went through endless 
acrifices to carry on the resistance 
gainst the Japanese. I tell you it 
ras the common man who saved this 
Duntry." 

This ranking member of President 



Sergio Osmena's cabinet promised to 
use all the power and influence at his 
command to give the common man of 
che Philippines a square deal in the 
postwar period. "In the reconstruction 
of our devastated country and in the 
development of our economic resour- 
ces, the common man should be given 
all the opportunities and facilities to 
live decently, to live as a human being. 
The common man has long been the 
victim of exploitation. He should 
have a greater share of the product 
of his own toil." 

Secretary Confesor ' advocated 
stronger cultural ties with the United 
States. "We can form a stronger 
bond with the United States more 
easily through the use of a common 
language," he said. "I advocate the 
continued use of English as a national 
language. In my opinion, the use of 
English in the system of public , ins- 
truction in the Philippines has been 
the most vital factor in bringing 
about national unity." Confesor pro- 
posed that not only instruction in 
schools should continuue to be in 
English but also that the English 
classes in Philippine high and nor- 
mal schools and universities should 
be taught by American teachers or 
professors who have specialized ' in 
English. 



Byrnes Places Pacific War Needs 
Above Reconversion After V~E Day 

Washington— U. S. Director of War Mobilization James Byrnes, in a 
report to President Roosevelt and congross, declared that the plans of 
the government should be ready for the day of victory in Europe but that 
"in making these plans we must face the sober reality of war in the Pacific 

against... a foe who is strongly in-3>

■lousing Violations 
ivestiga+ed At Rate 
)f Twenty Each Day 

A daily average of 20 cases in- 
olving increases in house rental and 
miction of tenants are investigated 
y the house rental section of the 
riminal Investigation Division of the 
'ffice of the Provost Marshal, ac- 
)rding to Atty. Emilio Torres, chief 
f the division. ; 

In some cases the house owners 
re charged by their tenants with 
iking the rental as high as 300 per 
ent mdre than the* ipre-war rate, 
'orres said this is a gross violation 
f the executive order which set the 
icrease in house rentals at not more 
lan 25 per cent. 

Landlords threaten their tenants 
r ith eviction when they do not pay 
le demanded increase, Torres added, 
lost of the tenants do not object to 
le 25% increase but unscrupulous 
mdlords not infrequently insist on a 
00 per cent increase, especially when 
bher parties make tempting offers 
rith a view to converting the pre- 
sses into business establishments, 
[any cases not settled by the Office 
f the Provost Marshal reach the 
ivil courts.

All PCAU stores, retailers or 
wholesalers in Greater Manila who 
ave filed applications for licenses

BOOK ON ARCHITECTURE 
IS GIFT OF MANIIAN 
TO MALACANAN LIBRARY 

Enrico Cardenas of Manila has do- 
nated a book on architecture entitled. 
Renaissance Architecture in Tuscany, 
by Segmann & Geymuller, to the Phil- 
ippine Commonwealth, together with 
10 reams of coupon bond typewriting 
paper. "After the Japanese have 
wantonly destroyed several cities and 
towns in our country, including Ma 
nila," Mr. Cardenas wrote to the 
President, "I believe that a book on 
architecture will be of some help to 
our government in the reconstruction 
period that will take place after 
wards." 

Acknowledging receipt of the gen- 
erous donation, Acting Assistant Se- 
cretary to the President Melquiades 
Gamboa informed the donor that the 
book will form part of 'Malacanan 
Palace library, and that on the re- 
turn of President Osmena who is out 
of the Philippines at present, "this 
commendable act of yours will De 
brought to his attention." 

"There is no doubt," Mr. Gamboa 
said, "that these gifts and the -ac- 
companying expressions of loyalty 
and good wishes will be appreciated 
by the President." 



on 

che mainland of Asia". 

Byrnes said that although the end 
)f the European war is in sight, war 
production must still come first. 
Jeavier shipments of supplies and 
munitions including many new types 
,)f weapons are needed for U\e final 
all out drive and for speeding up the 
Pacific war. 

Byrnes praised American manufac- 
turers and workers for doing a 
'splendid job" on the production 
front, pointing out that where sche-* 
dules were not met it was due to 
concentration on specially needed mu- 
nitions and partly to a temporary 
mortage of civilian workers. Lend- 
lease supplies to our allies, he said, 
must continue after Germany's defeat 
;n order to press the Pacific war to 
its earlier conclusion. Byrnes dec- 
lared that the United States must 
assist in a speedy revival of world 
capacity to produce and consume, re- 
commending extension of reciprocal 
trade agreements, establishment of 
tn international monetary fund, an 
international bank for reconstruction 
and development, and extension of 
authority for an export-import bank 
finance- American foreign trade. 
He also suggested repeal of the John- 
son Act barring loans to govern- 
ments in default of debts to the Uni- 
ted States. 

America, Byrnes said, will eat less 
this year than last year in order to 
provide relief for sufferers in li- 
berated localities and in enemy areas 
occupied by our troops. He cited that 
relief for the people of Italy is being 
furnished, and that when our zone 
of control in Germany is established 
its women and children will be cared 
for. Congress, Byrnes said, should 
soon determine the amount of funds 
to be made available for this purpose. 



Reds Seize Bratislava; 
Enter Vienna Outskiris 

Moscow— Marshal Stalin announ- 
ced Wednesday that Bratislava, prov- 
incial capital of Slovakia, has been 
occupied by Marshal Malinovsky's 
troops, 24 hours after they reached 
the suburbs of the great Danubian 
city on three sides. 

The liberation of Bratislava un- 
hinges the northern anchor of the 
powerful enemy defenses based on 
Lake Ncusiedler and intended to 
guard Austria from the southeast. 
Other anchor of the defense line, the 
Hungarian fortress of Sopron, was 
captured by Marshal Tolbukhin's 3rd 
Ukranian Army several days ago. 

Tolbukhin's troops were some six 
miles from Vienna, which was within 
easy reach of Soviet artillery. The 
Moscow announcement hinted that the 
Oder river front facing Berlin may 
soon see action.

[ Mustangs. Spread Havoc 
Among Formosa Targets 

Rounding up stray targets of op- 
portunity on Formosa recently, eight 
Mustangs of the Fifth Air Force 
Fighter Command shot-up transpor- 
tation, installations and Japanese 
troops. s . 

Along Formosa's railroads and 
! highways, the Mustang pilots des- 
troyed 15 trucks, two busses, two lo- 
comotive^ three boxcars, and a bubd- 
ing packed with Japanese troops. 
They damaged another locomotive, 
riddled a power station, and tho- 
roughly strafed * large factory. 



American Planes To Join 
War On Mosquitoes, Flies 

The city health department will 
take steps to wipe out mosquitos and 
flies in Manila in the next few days 
when low flying American transport 
planes will spray the entire city, it 
was announced yesterday. 

The spray which kills flies and 
mosquitos is not harmful to human 
beings and foods, it was explained, 
but will spot clothine:. The depart- 
ment warns the public to cover 
clothe to protect them from this dan- 
ger. 

Mosquitos and flics have been a big 
headache to the department as they 
constitute a positive threat against 
public health. It is feared that if they 
are not exterminated they will bring 
to the city epidemics of dengue fever, 
diarrhea and dysentery. 



RUHR ENCIRCLEMENT 
GAINS COMMENDATION 
FROM EISENHOWER 

General Eisenhower has addressed 
the following order of commendation 
to "every member of the A. E. F.": 

"The encirclement of the Ruhr by 
a wide pincer movement has cut off 
the whole of army group B and parts 
of army group II (enemy units), 
thus forming a large pocket of enemy 
troops whose fate is sealed and who 
are ripe for annihilation.- 

"The most vital industrial area is 
denied to the German war potential. 
This magnificent feat of arms will 
bring the war more rapidly to a 
close. It will long be remembered 
in history as an outstanding battle — 
the Battle of the Ruhr." 



ALLIES ENTER TAUNGUP 

Calcutta — Units of the 15th In-

ANOTHER JAP FAILURE 

It is a shame, in some resjtects, that members of the Japanese High 
Command can't be taken on a specially conducted daylight tour of Manila. 
For they would see, on every street comer, evidence of the complete failure 
vf their policy of killing, pillaging and destroying. 

Manila is a city of determination, Us people are imbued with vigor and 
}>i;Mtt*fcvj ulnvxti* the Japanese could destroy the city f but then could #ot 
den troy ike people. So the people who built .the city %n ike first place, arc

'i hu United States Army, with its unsurpassed mechanical equipment 
and "know-how , n ^ is setting the pace. Army trucks are moving .away the 
rubble,- construction^ engineers are patching up the building x t sig?ial corps- 
men are restoring light and power. 

If the Japanese who ordered the destruction of Manila, and of all oth&r 
cities and towns in the Philippines that fell within their reach, could nee the 
futility of their policy of annihilation, they might save the rest of tlie Far 
East from tiw carnage and destruction wreaked on the Philippines. But that 
in probably pious hope, in view of the medieval barburianism that controls 
Japanese policies today.

Beautiful New City Envisioned 
In Plans To Rebuild Manila 

The preservation and reconstruction of historical landmarks refilling 
of esteros, widening and straightening: Of city streets, round in*' of street 
corners, zoning of city districts with independent public markets are sa- 
lient features of tentative plans being<J> 
drawn in Malacafian for the rebuild- 
ing of Manila it was learned yester- 
day* 

Manila real estate proprietors and 

the general public will be acquainted 

with detail's of the plans in the near 

future, Inasmuch as AO percent of 

property in Manila is privately 

owned, it was pointed out that the 

major share of the rebuilding of thy 

city will have to depend on the people 

themselves. 

One of the plans envisions a water- 
front area which will embrace the 

section from the present port area tc 

Ton do and Sim Nicolas districts. Out 
„ of the slums, a large commercial and 

industrial center is expected to arise. 

Taft Avenue and Dewey boulevard 
may be made into main arteries of 
traffic. A riverside promenade along 
both sides of the Pasig river ,to widen 
the Escolta wHI be constructed. As 
much as possible, care will be taken 
to preserve the sites of burnt or de- 
molished churches and buildings of 
historical or aesthetic importance. 
Seme of these sites will have to be 
demolished, however, for the sake of 
appearance or sanitary convenience. 

Plans envision the rebuilding of the 
historic Walled City, now a mass of 
ruins because of the scorched-earth 
tactics of the Japanese. Malato and 
Ermita districts may be turned into 
apartment and hotel centers, with 
parks surrounding them in the recon- 
verted Si iifr along sector. 

None of the plans in Malacafian 
arc in, the final stajso. Members of 
the City Planning Division are how- 
ever busily at work to create a gen- 
eral plan which will satisfy Manilans

As early as December, 1912, civil 
government began to function in La- 
nao, under the direction of rru-rriilas 
organized by GoL Wendell Fertig. The 
seat of government was first located 

vi r^ an ' but was transferred

VlacArthur Heads All Pacific Armies 



Washington — General Douglas MacArthur has been placed in command 
I til army forces in the Pacific theatre of war, and Admiral Chester Nimitz 
aa been selected to command all Pacific naval forces, it was announced 
gsterday by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 

General Henry H. Arnold will continue in command of the 20th Airforce, 
>mposed of the giant B-29s. MacArthur has been commander-in-chief of 
ie Southwest Pacific, and Nimitz commanded the Pacific Ocean areas, 
jacb commanded naval, air and sea forces in his own area. 

The announcement said that "normally General MacArthur will be 
iiarged with conduct of land campaigns and Admiral Nimitz will conduct 
2a campaigns. Each commander will furnish forces and resources of his 
ervice for joint forces which are required for conduct of operation or cam- 



paign such as has been duly directed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff." The 
Joint Chiefs of Staff will continue to exercise strategic direction of the en- 
tire Pacific theater and will charge either General MacArthur or Admiral

paigns. 4 

The announcement added that "essentially, the new arrangement per- 
mits either commander in chief to conduct operations or campaigns in any 
part of the entire theater as directed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and 
the choice as to which will be charged with responsibility in each case will 
be dependent upon the nature of the operation or campaign to be under

WS DENOUNCE JAP NEUTRALITY PAG 



MOSCOW SAYS 
\GREEMEM 
UEANINGl&S 

Moscow — Russia denounced 
he Russian-Japanese neutrality 
►act yesterday. The treaty ex- 
►ires April 25, 1946, and would 
tave been automatically extend- 
d for five years if it had not 
ieen denounced. 

Soviet Foreign Commissar Vyaches- 
iv Molotov, in a note to the Japanese 
mbassador to the Soviet Union, point- 
d out that the neutrality pact was 
included April 13, 1941, before Ger- 
lany attacked Russia and before the 
utbreak of war between Japan and 
ie United States and Great Britain. 
"Since that time the situation has 
langed radically," Molotov wrote. 
Germany has attacked the USSR and 
apan, Germany's ally, helps the 
Ltter in the waf against the UbSlC. 
esides, Japan is fighting the United 
tates and Great Britain, who are 
[lies of the Soviet Union. 

"Under such 'conditions, the 
neutrality pact between Japan 
and the USSR has lost its mean- 
ing, and its prolongation becomes 
impossible; 9 Molotov^ note de- 
clared. 

Molotov cited Article Three of the 
act, which provides for the right of 
enunciation one year prior to the 
jcpiration of the five year term con- 
*act» 

The note was handed to Japanese 
Linbassador Sato in the midst of the 
apanese cabinet crisis.

Okinawa — American forces have 
battled their way within four miles 

>f Naha, capital of Okinawa Island, 
and within 3,000 yards of the Machi- 
aato airstrip, against increasing Jap- 
inese resistance, front dispatches re- 
oorted yesterday. 

Marines on the north side of the 
American wedge worked forward 
from three to five miles without meet- 
ing opposition, but heavy artillery 
and mortar fire from well organized 
Japanese units slowed the drive to- 
ward Naha, limiting gains on the 

outhwestern coast to 2,000 yards and 
stopping the Seventh Division's push 
»n the southeastern coast after an ad- 

ance of 500 yards. 

The Americans now control more 
han 80 square miles, or one sixth 
•f the island. 



MacArthur' s Selection 

Hailed By Leaders Here 

"MacArthur will go down in 
history as the world's greatest 
general," Secretary Tomas Ca- 
bili of National Defense de- 
clared upon hearing the news 
that General of the Army Mac- 
Arthur had been made comman- 
der of all allied forces in the 
Pacific theater. 

Secretary Maximo Kalaw of 
the department of Instruction 
and Information declared that 
MacArthur's new designation is 
a recognition of his great leader- 
ship. 



LOSS OF PHILIPPINES 
RESULTS IN OUSTER 

Tokyo radio announced yesterday that the Koiso cabinet 
has collapsed. Admiral Baron Kantaro Suzuki has been ordered 
to form a new cabinet. 

Koiso's resignation, along with those of his entif-e cabinet, 
came yesterday morning after a long series of military defeats 
in the Pacific, climaxed by General MacArthur's liberation of the 
Philippines, and the successful American landings in tfte Ryukyus.

ALLIES NOW HOLD 
OVER ONE-THIRD 
OF PRE-WAR REICH 

Paris — With more than one-third 
of pre-war Germany already in their 
hands, the victorious Allied armies 
swept forward on all sectors of the 
western front yesterday. 

Two Ninth Army divisions crossed 
the Weser River south of Hamlin 
and threw the Germans back toward 
the Elbe, last barrier before Berlin. 
The enemy was reported evacuating 
Hannover and retreating hastily to- 
ward the Elbe which flows within 
50 miles of their capital. 

General Patton's armor was in 
Scholtheim only 132 miles southwest 
of Berlin. Canadian armored forces 
seized Almelo, 35 miles east of the 
Zuider Zee and 70 hiiles from the 
North Sea port of Emdon. The Bri- 
tish Seventh Armored Division was 
within 38 miles of Bremen in a drive 
through Osnabrueck. 

In the past 14 days, 254,471 Ger- 
man prisoners have been taken — an 
average of about 18,000 a day. 

GIVE UP PRIVILEGES 

Chungking — Sweden signed a 
treatv with China today relinquishing 
extraterritorial and other, previliges 
in the country. 



announcing Premier Koiso's failure, 
said only that the resignations were 
submitted "in view of the war situa- 
tion and in order to bring a more 
powerful cabinet into office." 

Behind this "explanation" were 
the unbroken line of Pacific defeats, 
mounting American air attacks which 
have devastated vast areas of Jap- 
anese business and industrial centers 
and brouglrt an abject apology from 
the Koiso government to the people 
for failure to protect them, and the 
grave threat to the home empire itself 
by the loss of I wo Jima and the win- 
ning of a foothold by American forces 
on Japan's "doorstep" island of Oki- 
nawa. 

General Kuniaki Koiso himself, at 
the emergency meeting marking his 
regime's fall, collected the resignations 
and submitted them to Emperor Hi- 
rohito. 

The emperor immediately summon- 
ed Marquis KoicKiro Kido, lord keeper 
of the privy seal, "for consultations 
regarding the choice of the next pre- 
mier," and Kido conferred with the 
council of former Japanese premiers. 

Baron Suzuki, 77-year-old president 
of the Japanese privy council, was 
recommended to succeed Koiso as pre- 
mier, and the emptor ordered him to 
organize a new cabinet.

85 women and children on a concrete 
flooring from which blood trickled 
to a ditch below, The bodies were 
then dumped into the ditch. Small

victims taking refuge from artillery 
fire, were shot, their bodies then 
burned. Other bullet-riddled, burnt 
bodies were discovered hanging on a 
wall and* on the ground. One mother, 
holding a boy, appeared to be shield- 
ing the child from attack* An un- 
determined number of charred re- 
mains were found on Colorado street 
near the Price home. 

Major Binkley, accompanied by 
Francisco del Rosario, funeral dir- 
ector of the Cfty of Manila, dis- 
covered 100 burned bodies of men, 
women and children at Concordia 
College, Approximately 600 Filipino 
bodies were found in three dungeons 
within the Walled City, either starved 
or suffocated to death. Forty priests 
of the Manila Cathedral were mur- 
dered at Plaza McKinley, all in 
priest's robes. Forty five bodies of 
women and several children lay in the 
Campos residence, Taft avenue. 
Many of the women had been as* 
saultcsd, then bayonet ted through 
their genital organs, and all of the 
children cruelly bayonetted.

Practically all of the Manila north

ter consumers must carefully con- 
serve water because reservoirs are at 
low ebb without hope of replenish- 
ment, in the dry season. 

Consumers are asked to see^that

Jap Soldier Surrenders; 
Shouts "Phooey On Japan 11 

With The 25th Infantry (Trohc 
Lihgtning) Division On Luzon — 
Major James A. Moore of Kansas 
City, Missouri, battalion executive of- 
ficer of a combat unit of the 25th di- 
vision, fighting in the Balete pass 
area of northern Luzon, recently had 
the "distinction" of being "adopted*' 
by a jap soldier who was apparently 
fed up with the "Bushido" code of 
dying for the Emperor. The Jap sur- 
rendered to Major Moored doughboys 
by advancing on their position with 
upraised arms, waving a surrender 
leaflet and shouting "Japan phooeyl" 

Before being taken to the rear, the 
unusual Nip insisted on following the 
busy Major about the battalion com- 
mand post, occasionally giving vent 
to his favorite theme; "Japan phooey."

Joaquin Says Food Prices 
Continue To Soar Here 

Prices of foodstuffs continue to 
■iae, according to Atty. Don a to F.

Joaqui cited the following reasons 
behind high prices: (1) official prices 
if certain commodities are low, even 
ower than those before the outbreak 
if the war; (2) there is no coopera- 
ion from the people in enforcing the 
irice control order in that they con- 
inue to buy goods even if they know 
hat the prices arc above those pres- 
cribed by the government; (3) mem- 
bers of the armed forces pay top 
jrices for anything that they buy; 
4) city restaurants compete with 
iousewives by offering to pay more 
or the goods they buy; (5) people 
dctimized by profiteers not infre- 
luently refuse to testify in court 
Lgainat the latter.

Daring Thirteenth 
Shatters Jap Ships 

Headquarters, 13th Aap, Philip- 
penes. — Japanese shipping in the 
southern Celebes lost heavily to the 
veteran "Long Rangers 1 ' of the 13th 
AAF, the Jungle Air Force, when, in 
one roaring, co-ordinated sweep, they 
sank a destroyer, probably sank ano- 
ther, left a 150-foot vessel listing 
with all its crew abandoning ship in 
panic, and severely damaged six other 
cargo vessels by strafing. 

It was the biggest bag in several 
months in the virtually blockaded Ma, 
kassar Straits. 

The "Long Rangers" took off about 
three hours after receiving the mes- 
sage announcing sighting of the Jap 
(Jonvoy. The regularly^schqduled 
crews and planes for that day's mis- 
sion were striking enemy land instal- 
lations in Northern Borneo when the 
radio from a patrol plane told of the 
presence of the destroyers and their 
cargo charges. 

Crews, resting from the previous 
day's longrange mission, had to be 
used. Remaining available aircraft, 
waiting for check-ups and minor re- 
pairs, were pushed into service. 

Ordered to a rendezvous on the 
coast of the Celebes, the "Long 
Rangers" sighted the Japs before ren- 
dezvous could be made and formation 
assumed. 

The convoy was spotted by the lea- 
der of the "Long Ranger" group, 
Capt. Clyde W. Dooley of Kalama- 
zoo, Mich, Five of the "Long Ranger" 
planes formed a ring around the des- 
-troyer as it zigzagged wildly and fired 
inaccurate ack-ack. The B-24 Libe- 
rators tightened the noose, attacked 
singly from different directions. 

Bombs from the first four Libera- 
tors missed but fell close enough to 
damage the warship's rudder, causing 
the ship to wheel in circles, and 
slacken speed. Then 2nd, Lieut, Ken- 
neth L. Smith of Alvin, Ilk, piloting 
the fifth plane, made his run. His 
bombardier, 2nd Lieut William Hi 
Cunningham of Concrete, Washing- 
ton, walked a string of nine 500- 
pounders down the decks of the 
swerving destroyer. There was a tre- 
mendous explosion and the destroyer 
disappeared In 30 seconds. 

Meanwhile, another plane engaged 
a large schooner- type cargo flhip,

missing with its bombs. The vessel 
and two smaller ones circled the po- 
sition where the destroyer went down, 
picking up survivors. Smith Dooley 
and other pilots strafed the three 
ships, heavily damaging the smaller 
vessels while the larger vessel listed 
badly with the crew abandoning ship. 

Three more ships, moored to a dock 
in a small bay in the Gulf of Bone, 
were bombed and two barges strafed. 

Another small convoy was sighted 
toward Makassar Town by other 
"Long Ranger" planes. Two destro- 
yers and a gunboat raced out of the 
harbor and* 1st. Lieut William H. 
Stephens of Opal, Ark,, made a single- 
plane attack on one of the destroyers. 
The bombardier, Second Lieutenant 
Eugene C. Rice, of Camp Hill, Har- 
risburg, Pa., dropped four bombs on 
the first run which fell alongside the 
speeding destroyer splashed huge 
waves over its decks. 

Stephens made a ISO- degree turn 
for another rim where Rice expended 
the five remaining bombs, two plas- 
tering the destroyer, Terutsuki class, 
amidships. The warship caught fire 
in recurrent explosions scattering oil 
and debris over the water. It was 
left in a sea of flame probably sunk. 
Stephens also strafed a cargo vessel 
causing severe damage. 

The "Long Rangers" expended 
more than 12*000 rounds of ammuni- 
tion and more than 25 tons of bombs 
— all in one lightning stroke.

Extension of trw tiade 
between the United States «f 
Philippines on a greater scale for ai 
least 20 years was advoveated by tr*e 
American Chamber of Commie 
recent statement issued by its pree 
ident, Samuel P-OacheB. 

The Chamber believes that trie re- 
construction and rehabilitation of tne 
Philippines depends on free trade and 
that the country which baa borne the 
brunt of Japanese destruction under 
the American flag should be given 
every consideration in speedily rees- 
tablishing its economy- . 

The statement pointed out that if 
free trade is not established U^een 
the two countries both ^ *5§£ 
The Philippines cannot find any otner 
available market in the Far Bast 
in Europe for their raw products, 
which the United States cannot ^ af- 
ford to lose the Philippine market 

"The standard of living m tne ^f" 
lands has been increased W **** 
trade, and the demand for American 
products has increased /ccordingly. 
The Chamber said. "Under free trade 
relationship, Philippine - American 
trade has equalled American trade 
with China and one-third formerly 
with the Japanese Empire.

Of special interest to French, Chi- 
nese and other allied nationals is the 
opening beginning today of commer- 
cial communications between Manila 
and a dozen other countries. 

Leon Javinezp in charge of the Press 
Wireless Agency on the corner of 
Quezon boulevard and Raon St., said 
that wireless communications from 
Manila can now be made with Spain, 
Free France, London, Palestine, 
Chungking, Mexico, Cuba, New Zea- 
land, Rio de Janeiro, Panama City, 
Puerto Rico, and Santiago de Cuba. 

Heretofore wireless communications 
were only possible between the Unit- 
ed States, Hawaii, India and Austra- 
lia. But as the Allied forces in dif- 
ferent parts of the globe make their 
advance on all fronts, more and more 
countries and cities are brought with- 
in the orbit of direct wireless com- 
munications with Manila, he said. He 
predicted that in a few months the 
disrupted communications system be- 
tween Manila and a few unHberated 
countries will be completely restored. 



CHINESE LAUNCH ATTACK 
ON LARGE JAPANESE 
FORCE IN 2 PROVINCES 

Chungking — The Chinese High

mated at eighty thousand in south- 
west Honan and Northern Hupeh, 

In Honan, the Chinese counter-at- 
tacked and regained the town of 
Suichwan, twenty-two miles southwest 
of Neisiang. Four hundred Japanese 
were killed. 

Thirty miles southeast of the for- 
mer air base of Laohokow in Hupeh, 
the Chinese launched another attack 
against the enemy-held town of Siang- 
yang on Han river. Three Japanese 
strong points were taken and more 
than two hundred troops were killed 
and wounded. Chinese reports said 
that the Japanese suffered heavy 
losses in what were described as "fu- 
tile attacks' 1 around Laohokow.

VICTORIOUS ALLIED ARMIES PUSH AHEAD 
ON EVERY WESTERN EUROPEAN FRONT 



Paris — General Hodges' First 
American Army drove across the 
Weser River Saturday, joining Amer- 
ican Ninth and British Second troops 
on a 50 miles front, while in the 
north, the British Seventh Armored 
Division gained up to 35 miles, send- 
ing forward units to a point south- 
east of Bremen, German stronghold 
3 miles east of the Weser. 

In the south, the Sixth Armored 
Division pounded 7 miles north to the 
city of Keit, 8 miles north of Muel- 
hafen plain, while other units cleared 
Langensalza, 10 miles north of Gotha, 
Threatening Stuttgart, Seventh Army 
forces pushed six miles below Amer- 
gen, and on an eastward surge Amer- 



ican tanks overcame stiff opposition 
from self-propelled guns and en 
trenched riflemen. 

First Army units, menacing Ger 
mans pocketed in the Ruhr, cleared 
defenders from factories and bar 
racks advancing 5,000 yards in the 
Siegen area. The Americans now hold 
a 35 mile assault front to the east 
and a 70 mile front along the Ruhr 
pocket. American Ninth and British 
Second armies scored gains on a wide 
front, cracking the whole northern 
flank of German positions despite 
Nazi reserves rushed from Demark. 
British forces were reported 150 miles 
beyond the Rhine and rapidly encircl- 
ing Hanover. 



SINK YAMATO 
AND 5 OTHERS 

Guam — Japan's greatest 
battleship, the 40,000 ton Yama- 
to, and five other warships were 
sunk yesterday by aircraft of 
Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's 
carrier task force in a mighty 
naval and air battle fought in 
;he East China Sea, marking the 
first venture of the Japanese 
leet out of the inland sea since 
the battle of Leyte Gulf last 
October. ■ 
Three hundred ninety one Japanese 
aircraft were shot down or destroyed 
by the American airmen in the Fri- 
day and Saturday battle, ranging 
from Okinawa to Kyushu, Japan's 
most southerly home island. 

In addition to the powerful Yamato 
the Japanese lost a light cruiser, 
Agano class, a small cruiser and three 
destroyers. Admiral Nimitz announced 
that American losses were seven air- 
craft, with several destroyers and 
smaller craft damaged. Search air- 
craft sighted the Japanese fleet head- 
ing into the East China Sea sometime 
yesterday morning. Mitscher prompt- 
ly sent his task force to intercept. 
Carrier planes first hit the Jap fleet 
at midday, 50 miles southwest of 
Kyushu. 

Despite heavy gunfire from the 
ships, American planes swarming in 
all directions, crashed deadly torpe- 
does and bombs into hulls and decks 
of the Japanese force. The Yamato 
went down belching smoke and fire 
from at least eight torpedo and eight 
heavy bomb hits. The Japanese light 
cruiser, a smaller one, and three des- 
troyers followed the Yamato to the 
bottom- 
Navy spokesmen said that a good 
25 percent of the remaining Japanese 
major combat force has been lost or 
put out of action by East China Sea 
defeat. It leaves the Japanese with 
a task force that can easily be hand- 
led by any of our major task force. 
The spokesman said that emergence 
of the Japanese forces was presuma- 
bly an offensive action, although it 
might have been an effort to escape to 
safer waters, or to retire to remoter 
positions north of the home islands.

Broad Interpretation 

Of Independence Viewed 

By Kalaw In Radio Talk 

The new meaning of independence 
was discussed by Secretary Maximo 
Kalaw of the Department of Instruc- 
tion and Information in a radiocast 
over the Commonwealth Hour yester- 
day noon, 

"Independence will not mean for 
the Philippines, being cast loose," Sec- 
retary Kalaw explained, "Today in- 
dependence means the right to enjoy 
as a nation the four freedoms which

the individual and the right to pro- 
tection and security for those free- 
doms," 

He said that in order to enjoy such 
protection and security, the Philip- 
pines, along with other nations, must 
surrender those attributes of sove- 
reignity which in a more selfishly or- 
ganized world were considered indis- 
pensable, but which in a world or- 
ganized for permanent peace under a 
system of collective security, must be 
discarded by individual nations, and 
contributed by them to the pool of 
strength which will guarantee world 
peace, 

Kalaw explained that fndependece 
is a settled question. What should 
interest the people now is the nature 
Of the new independence under col- 
lective security, he pointed out.

The defense of the mining Town of 
Masinloc, Zambales, for three days 
beginning Palm Sunday, by a small 
gueirilla unit commanded by Captain 
Bienvenldo Mallari of the Luzon 
Guerrilla Forces, against a greatly 
superior Japanese force, was related 
yesterday by Di\ Honorio Edano, 
physician of the unit, who recently 
arrived in Manila. . 

Mallards men who numbered about 
thirty with old rifles and only three 
machine guns, but with plenty of am- 
munition saved the town from the 
possible wholesale massacre of its in- 
habitants, Dr. Edano said. 

In this three-day encounter, the 
guerrilla unit inflicted heavy casual- 
ties on the enemy who lost over 120 
men killed, while none of its member 
was even scratched by enemy gunfire, 
according to Dr. Edafio. 

He said that the guerrillas were 
rewarded with badly "needed arms 
captured from the Japs, including 
three trench mortars with 20 rounds 
of ammunition, six rifles and two 
sabres. For souvenirs, four Rising 
Sun flags and five helmets were cap- 
tured* 

"It was Palm Sunday at about 
8 a.m. and many Masinloc inhabitants 
were in the church when the first 
trench mortar shelling started/* Dr. 
Edano related. "There was a scramble 
in the church for a while and ,thcn 
cool heads finally got control and 
order was restored. 

"A runner from the guerrilla camp 
arrived and told us that the shelling 
came from a Japanese force of about 
500 kilometer from the eastern part 
of the town. He assured us that 
Captain Mallari had taken his men 



to the crest of the hill overlooking 
the invading enemy and that the town 
would be defended at all costs. 

"The women and children were 
then taken by small boats to the near- 
by island of San Salvador and the re- 
maining civilians were advised to 
seek cover as best they could. 

"On top of the hill, the guerrillas 
deployed and answered the enemy 
with a continuous fire from machine 
guns and Springfield rifles, To bluff 
the enemy, . they had to crawl to 
farther positions and fire from there 
and then return to their former posts, 

"About mid-day the Japanese 
ceased firing. From the top of the 
hill, Captain Mallari noted that the 
Japanese were taking lunch and he 
immediately ordered an advance. The 
Japs retreated, leaving their food and 
some of their arms behind. 

"It was during this retreat that 
the enemy sustained heavy casualties. 
In the next two days smaller numbers 
of Japanese patrols were sent to the 
outskirts of Masinloc but were re- 
pulsed." 

OFFICIALS DEFIED JAPANESE 

In a wireless just received by the 
Department of Interior, Gov- Ramon 
Imperial of Camarincs Sur told the 
Commonwealth Governor that all 
Commonwealth officials of the pro- 
vince, except two members of the 
provincial board, never surrendered

ACONFLICT IN (DEALOGIES 

The full story of Admiral Ko pa' 8 .capture on Cebu la at year throws a 
new tight on Japanese barbarity. When the commander of the combined 
Japanese fleet was forced down on Cebu, guerrillas picked him uj> and took 
him to the headquarters of LL CoL James Gushing, Sine* Gushing was 
a United. States Army officer^ openly waging war under command of General 
Mac Arthur^ he held Koga as a prisoner of war. 

But the Japanese High Command could not admit that their ranking 
admiral was a prisoner in the hands of Filamcrican guerrillas. That ivould 
be little short of sacrilege. So, in order to force Gushing to give up the 
Admiral, the Japs launched into a wholesale slaughter of innocent Cebuanos 
which was probably unparalleled in Philippine history. 

This put Colonel Gushing on the spot Bis prisoner was one of the great 
prizes of the war, and by all the rules of civilized warfare he was entitled I 
to keep his prize. But he also had the wanton slaughter of civilians to worry j 
about. It didn't take liim long to make up his ?tiind m 

hi keeping with American, as opposed to Japanese ideals, he fr_eed Koga 
in return for a pledge that the Japanese would cease their sickening butchery. 

Admiral Koga, sick beyond any hope of cure, died soon thereafter. 
Of course, the Japs defied him and announced he had died a glorious death 
for the Emperor, adding one. more fraud to the long list already perpetrated 
by the Tokyo warlords on the Emperor and on the people of Japan, 

But the peojile of Cebv t ond of the Philippine;^ know the real significance 
of Toga's death. They know that in it is to be found the conflict between 
a modem, humane progressive ideology and a medieval, barbaric retro- 
gressive ideology*

COL. JONES LAUNCHES VIGOROUS DRIVE 
Otf FOOD AND LIQUOR PROFITEERS 



Col. Marcus E. Jones, deputy pro- 
vost Marshal and chief of police of 
Manila, has damped down on unscru- 
pulous individuals taking advantage 
of the present acute economic diffi- 
culties by, firstly, requiring all per- 
sons bringing- in food to the city to 
obtain a government licence and, sec- 
ondly, requiring food and liquor shops 
to display a price list of all commo- 
dities for sale. Violation of the first 
order will bar the violator from en- 
tering the city, and for the second the 
lawbreakers' place will be padlocked 
and his license confiscated* 

"I do not mean to curtail the bring- 
ing of foodstuff into the city," Col- 
onel Jones said, "but I certainly dis- 
like seeing Man Hans become the prey 
of unscrupulous vendors. The public 
must learn to cooperate in this move- 
ment if we are to solve this problem 
at all." 

Referring to the food and liquor 
shops. Colonel Jones will require all 
restaurants, bars and other places to 
keep posted in a conspicuous place a 
price list (Executive Order No.) 21 
of all commodities for sale. Colonel 
Jones warned that failure to do so 
and to ignore the schedule of prices 



will bring full penalty to violators of 
his order. Once a place is closed 
and its license confiscated, it will be 
necessary, he said, to obtain another 
h cense before reopening is permitted* 
The posting of the price list in all 
market stalls also applies to public 
.iiarkct vendors. They are warned 
that a violation of the order will 
mean the cancellation of their appli- 
cation for stall permit and that under 
no-condition will it be re-issued

AMERICAN TANKS CRACK NAZI LINE; 
DRIVE ON BERLIN 128 MILES AWAY 



Paris — U. S. Ninth Army tanks 
made a break-through Saturday that 
carried them within 128 miles of Ber-

ROMULO TO GIVE PROOF 
THAT TOKYO ORDERED 
DESTRUCTION OF MANILA 

New York — Brigadier General 
Carlos P. Romulo yesterday said he 
would place before Congress on April 
17 documentary proof that orders to 
destroy Manila and kill inhabitants 
were sent direct from Tokyo to the 
Japanese in the Philippines. 

Resident Commissioner Romulo told 
the Communion breakfast of the 
Catholic Institute of Press here that 
he would present affidavits and photo- 
graphs. 

After Romulo spoke, a plaque was 
awarded to Joe Rosenthal, Associated 
Press photographer who took the fam-

Suribachi on Iwo Jima. 



JAPANESE MAKE DESPERATE STAND 
AS YANKS GAIN FOURTH OF ISLAND 

Okinawa — Observers with the 24th Army Corps said yester- 
day that fighting on the Okinawa front rivals Iwo Jima in in- 
tensity and might bring the bloodiest fighting of the Pacific war. 
^ $ Japanese positions are cleverly con- 
ceived, as intricate as anything devis- 
ed by Germans, and smartly defended. 
The American assault yesterday gain- 
ed at most 300 yards. 

Inland, 7th Division troops are 
meeting the same tough resistance as 
did the Ninth farther south on the is- 
land. A 200-foot ridge, crowned by 
four blockhouses, was taken only after 
a daylong struggle. Heavy artillery, 
mortar and machinegun fire were en- 
countered as doughboys stumbled over 
coral embankments and through un- 
derbrush. 175 Japanese perished in 
the assault. 

Fighting was even more violent in a 
westward sector. However, capture 
of a rocky crag by the Americans re- 
moved the last obstacle before the 
strongly reinforced Machinato Line, 
where the Japanese seemingly plan to 
make a last major stand. General 
Buckner's Tenth Army of soldiers 
and marines now hold roughly one 
quarter of the island's 485 square 
miles. Japanese units held in reserve 
during the first week of fighting are 
entering the fight * 



MEXICAN PLANES IN PACIFIC 

"Mexico City — It was announced 
yesterday that Mexico's Air Squadron 
201 has left the United States for a 
Pacific base "to participate in the 
battle for democracy by fighting 
against Japan." 



When last reported, the Ninth Army 
tanks, which had slowed down to cross 
the Weser river, were on a super- 
highway 20 miles from Brunswick. 
The principal natural defense barrier 
between the Ninth and Berlin is the 
Elbe River. Hannover was by passed, 
but infantry and armored divisions 
were assigned to capture the city. 
Other Ninth Army forces, linked to 
First Army troops, pressed the clean- 
up of the Ruhr pocket and fought into 
Dortmund and Gelsenkirchen. 

Simultaneously, the First Allied 
Airborne Army dropped over a wide 
area of north Holland, joining the 
First Canadians in a move to smash 
the German retreat from the Nether- 
lands. 

The Canadians were but 14 miles 
from the Zuider Zee and 4% miles 
irom roads and railways along which 
thousands of coastal city Germans 
must travel to escape pocketing. 
General Pattons Third Army moved to 
within 130 miles of Berlin as the big 
tank battle roared into its second day. 
Last reports said that 50 German 
tanks had already been destroyed and 
that German reinforcements were 
hurrying from Weimar. 

At the southern end of the front, 
the Seventh Army neared Schwein- 
furt and the First French army cap- 
tured Pforzheim. General Hodges 
First Army completely collapsed 
enemy lines along the Weser. His 
swift moving infantry, overrunning 
Goettingen, discovered 15,000 Ger- 
mans in a hospital.

mass shootings of men and boys in I™ «

pleading mercy for their doomed kin, 
and of other equally horrifying spec- 
tacles. On two occasions she wit- 
nessed wholesale slaughters of about 
100 citizens at the intersection of Vic- 
toria and General Sulano streets with- 
in the Walled City. 

On each of these occasions, Jap- 
anese firing squads of ten soldiers 
lined tip civilians, then mowed them 
down with point-blank fire, Women, 
begging mercy for their relatives, 
were slain before they reached the 
Japnesc murderers. Others were shot 
down as they pleaded at the firing 
line. The Japanese went from house 
to house rounding up the victims, aged 
15 to 60 years, and accusing them 
of being guerrillas or American sym- 
pathisers. 

Miss Caruna then a nurse in St. 
Paul's Hospital, said that the Jap- 
anese made extensive preparations to 
defend the Walled City. Leaflets were 
passed to Filipino civilians within the 
walls, warning them that they would 
be shot on sight if detected leaving 
their homes. Many, forced outside to 
seek food and water for starving 
families, were killed by machinegun 
fire from nests set up at almost 
every street intersection. 

Miss Caruna, picturing her mirac- 
ulous escape from death, said that 
she had lived last February in Intra- 
muros with a family named Velez, at 
9S Anda street Mrs. Velez 's baby 
had been crying because of hunger, 
and a Japanese sentry appeared. He 
called Miss Coruna, who speaks some 
Japanese, outside a shelter, ordering 
her to return and quiet the infant 
Miss Coruna turned her back, and as 
she walked shelter wards the Japanese 
shot her in the legs, paralyzing the 
young woman from the hips down. 
Still conscious, she fell to the ground 
and feigned death. She watched the 
sentry enter the shelter, where Mrs. 
\ elez, baby in arma p tried to quiet its 
crying. Without preliminaries, the 
soldier thrust his bayonet into the 
babe : a head. Mrs. Velez was shot to 
death as she screamed in anguish, 
alter which the murderer disposed of 
her sister in the same manner. 

Miss Coruna was discovered on the 
ground by two Filipinos. As they 
caned her to a place nf safety, her 



' dating death when sentries ap-

# home of Dr. Celeste, a vice-minis-

With the 158th Regimental Com-

their cleaning up of Japanese pockets 
on Luzon's Bicol Peninsula, elements 
of the 158th Bushmaster Infantry 
have landed at Bacon, Philippines 
entry point of the Trans-Pacific 
Cable, approximately 22 miles south- 
east of their Easter Day landing at 
Legaspi Port. 

The new landing elements pushed 
quickly across the narrow neck of 
land from Albay Gulf to Sorsogon 
Bay without opposition. 

At the same time, stubbornly re- 
sisting Japanese troops continued to 
fight a strong delaying action along 
Road 160 about 2000 yards west of 
Legaspi. Approximately 1000 yards 
of the road just southwest of Daraga 
was controlled by our troops, but 
south of this position Japanese 
machine guns and mortars continued 
to offer stiff resistance. 

Close air support continued, with 
P-47s and A-20s dropping more than

have never denied, and as I am sure 
my people have never denied, our ra- 
cial heritage of the Orient. It is a 
rich heritage, rich in the things of the 
spirit, rich in the devotion of child to 
parent, rich in the humility with 
which we accept the will of God. But 
the spiritual heritage which is of the 
west, which has been our guide for 
four hundred and twenty five years, 
is also ours. By it we shall live as 
we have lived. For it we shall die, as 
many of our people have died in the 
last three tragic years." 

Cabili said that the Filipino people 
were oppressed by the invader be- 
cause the Filipinos chose to defend 
their spiritual heritage. He pointed 
out that when the invader offered the 
Filipinos peace if they would abandon 
their heritage, the people refused. 

"If we had surrendered," said Ca- 
bili, "perhaps our cities and villages 
would not be in ruins today. Perhaps 
our people would not be so impove- 
rished." 

Cabili pointed out that "the things 
that have been done to us were done 
because we chose to defend certain 
things. That is why we had to fight 
this war. And that is why we may 
have to fight again."

among the vast majority of the Filipino population. Anyone who would 
jeopardize the life of one of the liberators of the Philippines by selling him 
poisoned liquor should be puniahed to the fullest extent of the taw. 

Recently the city fiscal filed an information for multiple homicide 
through reckless negligence against a manufacturer and peddler of poisoned 
liquor which had resulted in the deaths of five American soldiers. 

Dean Francisco R. Capistrano, of the Arellano Law College, believes 
that the fiscal erred in not filing five separate charges for murder against 
the person charged with the crime. He contends that the selling of the 
poisoned liquor was deliberately and consciously done, that there were five 
separate crimes f that a charge for murder (carrying a maximum punishment 
of death) should have been filed instead of a charge of homicide (carrying 
a minimum punishment of four months)* 

Regardless of the legal aspects of the cane, everyone will commend Dean 
Capistrano for his civic mindedwess in talcing tip this case. The civilian 
officials of Manila will do their government a great disservice if they fail to 
press relentlessly for the punishment of the fiends responsible for the murder 
of American servicemen.

FORM ASSOCIATION 

To regulate restaurants and allied 
enterprises, an association of owners, 
of hotels, clubs, restaurants and bars 
was recently formed with Lorenzo 
Bautista of 1035 Bilibid Viejo as 
president. 

Mr. Bautista said that out of 120 
applicants for membership, only 12 
were approved to form the charter- 
member group. He stated that before 
an applicant was considered, his bus- 
in ess character as well as his reput- 
ation in the community and also his 
ethical conduct in other organizations 
were carefully investigated. 



Plcnes To Spray City 
With Insecticide Friday 

The spraying of the entire city by 
American transport planes as a mea- 
sure to get rid of mosquitos and flies 
which carry germs causing dengue 
fever, malaria, diarrca and dysen- 
tery has been set definitely for Fri- 
day, April 13, it was learned at the 
city health department yesterday. 

Although it was previously announ- 
ced that the spray will spot clothing, 
a city health official said that it will 
not harm those being worn, but that 
new cloths displayed for sale should 
be covered, however, as they will 
spotted.

"CO-PROSPERITY" 
Jn,t - * * ***** SU, 



Secretary of National Defense To- 
mat Cabili, ex-guerriJia leader in 
Mindanao Sunday declared that no 
person who had accepted appointment 
or performed service in a military or 
civil capacity in any activity controll- 
ed by the Japanese or the pnppet 
Philippine government will be admit- 
ed to the Philippine Army that is be- 
ing recreated. 

Secretary Gabili announced this 
policy of tlie Philippine Common- 
wealth government in an interview 
on the Philippine Hour. 

Exceptions to this ruling may he 
made in the cases involving individuals 
who joined and participated Actively 
with guerrilla, or United States armed 
forces prior to September 20 f 1044, 
one month before the American land-

OSMENA FIXES RENTS 
AT PRE-WAR RATES 

House owners in the Philippines 
cannot charge rental more than the 
pre-war rates, according to Executive 
Order No, 24 promulgated by Pres- 
ident Sergio Osmena which has been 
posted all over the city, 

This new regulation on house rents 
supersedes a former executive cider 
issued on October 2, 1941. According 
to the new order violators will be 
punished either with imprisonment cr 
a fine. 

Tenants in Manila who have been 
continually harassed by racketeering 1 
landlords hailed the new order because 
it fixes once and for all the main 
source of conflicts between landlords 
who insist on higher rentals and te- 
nants who refuse to pay the increased 
rental. The Office of the Provost 
Marshal which has been handling 
cases involving house rentals since the 
liberation of Manila believes there will 
be less complaints on the part of te^ 
nants now that the new executive 
order has fixed the ho use rental rates,

[MEDIATE RELIEF 

IGED FOR FILIPINOS 

Washington — Rep. Karl Stefan, 
mblican of Nebraska, former Ma- 
i newspaperman, on the floor of 

House yesterday said immediate 
to the Filipino people is necessary 
I "we must examine the needs of 

Filipino people and supply those 
ds, those basic needs of men and 
nen who are fighting and dying 
t Americans might live." 
>tefan said "clothing, feeding and 
ising the Filipinos is an elemental 
ae. It demands action. They must 
cared for before they can care for 
mselves. Before the Philippines 
umes normal functions — either as 
ommonwealth or a nation — we must

Justice Murphy Says U. 5. Obligation 
To Philippines "Greater Than Ever" 



Washington— U. S. Supreme Court 
Justice Frank Murphy, former high 
commissioner to the Philippines, in 
an opinion yesterday involving the 
import of hemp from the Philippines, 
said that the "moral and legal obli- 
gations" of the United States to the 
Philippines "are greater than ever 
before." He said: 

"It is clear that the Philippines 
cannot safely be thrown into the 
world market and left to shift for 
themselves. For the foreseeable fu- 
ture, at least, their economy must be 
closely linked to the United States, 
without either country abandoning or 
retreating from the common ideal of 
independence for the Philippines." 

Murphy's opinion was expressed 



along with the majority in a five to 
four decision of the Supreme Court, 
ruling that the products brought into 
this country from the Philippines were 
imports. Chief Justice Harlan F. 
Stone, delivering the majority 
opinion, said: 

"We conclude that the practical as 
well as the theoretical considerations 
of the structure of our constitutional 
system require us to hold that art- 
icles brought from the Philippines 
into the United States are imports 
x x x because the place from whence 
they are brought is not a part of the 
United States in a constitutional 
sense to which provisions with res- 
pect to imports, are applicable."

CABINET BACKS OSMENA'S REQUEST 
FOR ADVANCEMENT OF INDEPENDENCE 

The Philippine cabinet yesterday announced that it had "received with 
extreme gratification" the news that President Sergio Osmena had requested 
President Roosevelt to advance the date of Philippine independence to 
August 13, 1945. 

The cabinet heard Monday that 
President Osmena had made the re- 
quest in a letter to the American chief 
executive, and yesterday after a one- 
hour conference at Malacanan, issued 
the following statement: 

"The Philippine cabinet has re- 
ceived with extreme gratification the 
news that President Osmena has for- 
mally asked President Roosevelt to 
recognize the independence of the 
Philippines on August 13th of this 
year. The cabinet stands solidly be- 
hind the President, and firmly be- 
lieves that the advancement of the 
date of independence is but a fulfill- 
ment^ of the provisions of the Tydings- 
McDuffie Act and the Senate Joint 
Resolution No. 93 of . the Congress 
of the United States." 



Immediate Registration

In order to ascertain the num-

Jap Shipping 
Driven Out 
Of China Sea 

General MacArthur announ- 
ced today that the 41st Division 
landed in the Sulu Archipelago 
and seized its capital, the Jap- 
anese stronghold of Jolo. 

The landing occurred Monday after 
two weeks of saturation aerial at- 
tacks which completely disrupted the 
enemy's defenses. The Americana 
landed on the water front, captured 
the city and its airfields, and imme- 
diately drove inland 8 miles, scatter- 
ing all enemy resistance. 

"We now completely control the 
Sulu Archipelago," General Mac- 
Arthur's communique declared. 

Meanwhile, on Luzon, the 11th Air 
borne Division speedily drove more 
than 20 miles from Lucena to reach 
Atimonan on the east coast. General 
MacArthur stated that all organized 
enemy resistance in southern Luzon 
has collapsed and its liberation is at 
hand. 

To rescue the lepers of Culion Col- 
ony, American troops occupied Coron 
Bay on Busuanga Island north of 
Palawan, once used as an anchorage 
by the Japanese fleet during sorties 
against the American Leyte beach- 
head. The first medical and food 
supplies in three years were deliver- 
ed there by our troops. 

On Mindanao, American bombers 
hit Davao and Malabang, and the 
heavy aerial attacks on Formosa con- 
tinued at Matsuyama, Karenko, Taito 
and Koshun airfields, at the Keelung 
docks, as well as at Chomosui air- 
drome in the Pescadores. 

General MacArthur said the Amer- 
ican blockade has almost cleared the 
shipping lanes to the south in the 
China Sea. Medium bombers found 
no ships in their patrol runs, and 
turned their attention to bridges, rail- 
roads and other targets along the 
arterial railroad line running north 
along the French Indo-China coast. 
They also hit the Hoe How airdrome 
on Hainan. 



HAMBURG AND MUNICH 
ARE HEAVILY BOMBED 

London — American and British 
bombers dropped eleven and six-ton 
hombs on shipyards, oil and munitions 
tores and airfields at Hamburg and 
Munich yesterday, leaving large fires 
burning in submarine assembly yards. 

Over 250 bombers and 750 fighters 
bombed 10 airfields within 60 miles 
of Munich, and a synthetic oil plant 
near Leipzig was hard hit. Italy- 
based Liberators hit railyards at the 
Tronto Junction of the Brenner to 
Venice route and P-38s bombed brid- 
ges in Austria and southern Germany. 

Six German ships including a sub- 
marine were sunk in the Kiel at- 
fack April 3.

^Tuesday, 



Washington — Concern for the wel 
far* of the Filipino haa been and will 
continue to be the main motive in 
whatever steps the United States takes 
regarding the Philippines, Harold L. 
Jokes, secretary of the interior, 
declared. 

He said: 

"The army has assumed control of 
both direct relief and supply trade 
goods during the period of military 
activity. We assume this h bein£ 
done well, considering the extremely 
titfht shipping situation, 

"The Commonwealth Government 
has asked to take charge of direct 
relief alter the military period, 

"December 23rd, 1941, Congress ap- 
propriated funds for" civilian defense 
»nd public relief in the Philippines* 
About 525,000,000 remains unexpend- 
ed. The Commonwealth Government 



has requested access to these funds 
and I have endorsed that request. 

"The Commonwealth Government 
requested that I endorse a plan by 
which the Forcing Economic Ad- 
ministration would undertake the res- 
ponsibility for resumption of private 
trade under which the U. 3, Commer- 
cial Company when necessary would 
make shipments of trade goods to the 
Philippines," 

"the difficulty with all these pro- 
grams is not the question of available 
funds but the limitation of shipping 
space both from the United States 
to the islands and between the islands. 
Quite rightly purely military needs 
must come first. 

■ "Concerning the long range rehabi- 
litation wc have not yet been able 
to take definite action. As we view 
them the requirements are these: 
"Firstly an impartially administer- 



, compensation bill ( "wnen i* eo^ to

amendments are added, 
ment would extend the bill to cover 
claims of small farmers and house- 
holders/' - tl ^ 

"Secondly, definitely favorable set- 
tlement of future trade relations be- 
tween the United States and the Phil- 
ippines. There are many factors m- 
I volvcd, these must be harmonized 
somehow with prospective political re- 
| Jationships between the United States 
and the Philippines and with general 
United States trade policy. I do not 
think these arrangements should cover 
a shorter period than 20 years. Other- 
wise regardless of war-damage pay- 
ments there will be little reinvestment 
in agricultural and iig-ht industries in 
the islands," 



VAST NAZI TREASURES 
FOUND BY AMERICANS 
IN MINE NEAR BERLIN 

With U. S. Third Army in Ger- 
many — Associated Press Correspon- 
dent Edward Ball said the Third 
Army engineers today blasted a hole 
through the brick wall in Mergher 
salt mine, 140 miles west of Rcrlin 
and revealed more than 4,000 bags of 
ffoJd bullion each weighing 25 pounds. 

"The sacks were stacked along walls 
of the dimly lighted chamber measur- 
ing 65 by €5 feet along with thousands 
of sacks of coins too heavy for Amer- 
ican soldiers to lift," Ball said, Each 
unck bore a lead seal, red or yellow 
tag and in black print 'Keichsbank\ 

"In addition to sacks of gold bul- 
lion and coins, there were hundreds 
of paste board cases of Heichsmarks. 
Corridors leading to the 'gold room* 
were lined with huge stacks of bags 
containing 'Reichsmarks' and money 
of various other countries, including 
perhaps two million dollars in Amer- 
ican currency. Third Army officers 
began inventory of the treasure trove 
which will require days to complete. 

"With this vast monetary horde, 
the Germans had cached hundreds of 
priceless art works, including a Titian 
Venus. 

"Dr. Fritz Vicrck who was one of 
the three Reichsbank officials nabbed 1 
by Third Army soldiers in the mine 
*aid the bullion represented all the 
fold in Germany. 

"Dr. Werrner Have of the German 
state museum who was with Vierck 
aaid two-thirds of the Reichs national 
treasures were stored in the cave. He 
said the other third was in another 
salt mine which has been overrun by 
the Americans, 

"Vierck said the Germans started 
moving the gold reserve and currency 
from Berlin on February 11 and tried 
to remove it from the salt mine a few 
days ago but were prevented by Pnt- 
ton s fast moving troops and the 
blown -up bridges."

rupting our forces protecting Okina-

pave the way for the Yamato to rush 
m with her 16 inch guns to blast the 
beachhead. Cruisers and destroyers 
were to help in a quick hit-and-run 
raid. 

Japanese air attacks, it was pointed 
out, had failed. The Yamato task 
force moved out of the inland sea 
down the east coast of Kyushu and 
around the southern tip of the island. 
They were ready for a dash into the 
East China Sea, The biggest mistake 
of all was that the weakened Jap- 
anese airforee lacked sufficient pilots 
and planes to protect the Yamato, 

Vice Admiral Mitscher sent his 
carriers northward when Navy 
searehplanes sighted the Yamato 
force off southern Kyushu. Pour 
hundred planes left the carriers 
shortly after noon, and the strike was 
completed about two o'clock that 
afternoon. In addition to the six Jap- 
anese vessels reported sunli, patrol 
planes remaining until" nightfall re- 
port seeing three additional dost ro- 
vers in flames. The sea was full 
of survivors and wreckage. 

Major units of the British Pacific 
Fleet, including the 35,000 ton battle- 
ship King George, were damaged by 
Japanese aircraft fire in a British 
strike against the Sakishima Islands, 
March 31 through April 2, Admiral 
Nimite reported. Five enemy planes

REPORTER DESCRIBES 
SINKING OF U. S. SHIPS 

Okinawa — Associated Press Cor- 
respondence Vern Haughland, des- 
cribed how three United States des- 
troyers were sunk in the air and sea 
battle of Okinawa, in which the 
American Task Force sank six Jap- 
anese warships, including the battle- 
ship Yamato, 

Attacked by eight to 10 enemy 
planes, one of the destroyers shot 
down the first two before it was hit. 
An LCS drew alongside the burning 
warship to remove the survivors and 
shot down an attacking plane. An* 
other destroyer came to the rescue 
and was shot three times in six at- 
tacks. Two more destroyers rushed 
up, drove the attacking Japanese 
planes off and picked up the sur- 
vivors as the first distressed war- 
ship went down. 

To the north another destroyer had 
30 feet of her stern blown away and 
also had to be sunk. Another des- 
troyer shot down two planes before 
sustaining damage and gallantly took 
in tow another ship which had been 
hit by three Japanese planes. 

It was disclosed here that when 
Navy search planes sighted the Ya- 
mato task force off Southern Kyushu, 
Vice Admiral Marc A, Mitcher sent 
his carriers speeding northward, A 
force of 400 planes took off from 
carriers shortly after noon. The 
strike was completed around 2 p.m. 
with the Yamato, a cruiser of the 
Agano class, another cruiser and 
three destroyers sunk and three other 
destroyers in flames.

toring pre-war sports facilities which 
were destroyed or damaged by the 
Japanese, With these facilities avail- 
able for use, athletic talent in the

CONTROLLING BLACK MARKETS 

njnrtila officials are doing a commendable job in trying to keep prices 
. ^ASiTh^v^ been Bet in line with prewar standards, and mde

But official attempts to control prices can never prevent black markets 
mithoiAt two assisting factors: 

* The veovle themselves must refuse to patronize black markets t dif- 
* n as it may be to exist on regularly rationed goods; and, 
1 1 Every effort must be made to bring increasing amounts of food 
tS m.d other consumer goods into the city. 

L the lona run, the law of supply and demand cannot be repealed.

of the olach market.

90-DAY DELAY STANDS 
ON APPLICATIONS 
FOR MARKET LEASES 

No application filed by a foreigner, 
ither than American, for the leasing 
of market stalls or for a license to 
engage in the business of selling food- 
stuffs and other articles of prime 
tecessity will be acted upon until 
if ter the lapse of 90 days from the 
cceipt of the application, Secretary 
if Interior Tomas Confesor has ruled. 

The ruling was made in connection 
vith the request made by the Chinese 
Chamber of Commerce for the recon- 
sider ation of Section 3 of Emergency 
Control Administration Order No, l t 
egarding the lease of market stalls 
in Manila, 

"As you very well know/* Secretary 
Confesor wrote the Chinese Chamber 
if Commerce, "many foreigners in 
Manila and in the Philippines who 
vere not placed in the concentration 
4 amp by the Japanese made patent 
"n various ways their anti-democratic 
sympathies as well as their support 
to the Axis Powers and their political 
ioctrines. 

"On account of this, they enjoyed 
special pr ivi leges from the enemy, 
Vou are also well aware of the sacri- 
fices of America and of the loyal Fili- 
pinos in their efforts to destroy Jap- 
anese power and influence in the 
Philippines. All this would be in vain 
should we allow these pro- Axis ele- 
ments to enjoy the same privileges 
as our loyal citizens do." 

There must therefore be sufficient 
time for the investigation of the eon- 
duct of the applicant during the Jap- 
anese regime before any action should 
be taken on his application, declared 
Confesor,

vRTILLERY DUEL 
)N NAHA FRONT 
COUNTS IN FURY 

Okinawa — While the great artil- 
ry duel on Okinawa mounted in fury 
isterday, American forces made a 
iw landing in the Ryukyus — this 
me on Tsugen Island 10 miles of the 
;st coast of Okinawa — against 
>ome enemy resistance." 
The Okinawa fighting was concen- 
ated on the southwestern coast as 
te Americans slugged into the de- 
mises shielding the capital city of 
aha. 

The Japanese threw a murderous 
lin of steel on Americans from posi- 
es on a mountain ridge near Naha. 
he ridge appears to be the main 
terny defense line and the Japanese 
:e defending it bitterly. In the 
iuthern sector General O. P. Smith, 
iputy chief of staff of the Tenth 
rmy, revealed that more battalions 
artillery are supporting American 
-ound troops than ever before in the 
acific. He said that the concentra- 
on of guns per yard equalled the 
aximum known in warfare. 
Marines in the north holding about 
ilf of the Motobu peninsula gained 
)00 yards, overrunning enemy sub- 
arine pens and other installations, 
ipanese casualties reached 5,000 
ith 222 prisoners taken. Marine 
rtillery battalions, not needed in 
le north, where the 3rd. Marine 
mphibious Corps is pinching off the 
;otobu peninsula, were shifted to the 
>uthern sector/ 

Battleships and cruisers turned 
ieir heavy guns on Japanese em- 
acements sheltered in the hills, 
espite this support, American forces 
ere often pinned down by terrific 
ipanese fire, and American gams 
ere measured in yards. The 24th 
rmy Corpsmen on the west coast 
ere still about two miles north of 
ie Machinato airdrome, with another 
miles to go to Narhro. The Seventh 
ivision has gained 'possession of the 
onabaru airfield in the west. 
Americans fought from cave to 
tve and pillbox to pillbox in savage 
md to hand struggles to make their 
iins. After concentrating artillery 
p on it all night, the Seventh Divi- 
on recaptured the Red Hill strong 
)int. It was taken by the Japanese 
Le day before in a combined tank,

Americans Liberate Sampaloc; 
Secure Road Nets In Tayabas 



General MacArthur reported today 
that 14th Corps troops in southern 
Luzon are exploiting the enemy's dis- 
organized state by quickly securing 
the various road nets in southern 
Tayabas. 

First Cavalry troops advanced 14 
miles from Lucban to occupy Sam- 
paloc sending advance elements to 
Mauban on the east coast, while 11th 
Airborne units moved in force into 
the Atimonan area. In the Legaspi 
area the 158th Regimental Combat 
team continued its attack, capturing 
14 artillery pieces of various calibre, 
numerous trucks, a large fuel dump 
and technical equipment. 

In the center, 14th Corps troops 
continue to clear the area and are 
now advancing north east in the 
Angat River watershed. 

In the north, the Americans system- 
aticallv reducing the Balete Pass and 
Villa Verde Trail defenses, sealed 
58 cave strongpoints. Along the Na- 
guilian-Baguio road, we captured 
Salat, 'three miles southeast of Bur- 
gos and 11 miles inland from Bauang 
on the coast. * 

Air patrols hit installations near 
Baguio and other American planes 



wrecked five bridges and exploded 
enemy ammunition dumps in the road 
net leading to the southern Cagayan 
Valley. 

On Negros, the 40th Division has 
advanced 30 miles from Fabrica 
around the northern tip of the island 
to San Isidro and is pursuing enemy 
forces which have been isolated and 
forced into a narrow hill compartment 
12 miles inland. General MacArthur 
announced that civil government is 
rapidly being restored on Negros, 
which is practically freed of enemy 
control. 

On Mindanao, heavy bombers hit 
the road center of Kabakan and 
fighter patrols strafed Matina, Lica- 
nan and Sasa airdromes, destroying 
grounded planes. Other heavjes feit 
Koshun town and airdrome on For- 
mosa and air patrols destroyed four 
enemy ships and bombed fuel instal- 
lations at Mako in the Pescadores. 

The Victoria docks at Hongkong 
also were bombed, as well as two 
radio stations and railroad installa- 
tions on Hainan. A Japanese ship 
was sunk off Luichow Peninsula. To 
the south, a French Indo-China troop 
train was completely destroyed with 
direct hits. 



Yanks And Reds 
Only I 50 Miles 
From Junction 

Paris — While American First 
Army tanks drove into the Thurin- 
gian plain yesterday only 115 miles 
from Berlin and American Ninth 
Army troops burst into Hannover and 
beyond that flaming communications 
center to slash the Berlin super-high- 
way 120 miles from the Nazi capital, 
more than 2,150 American planes in- 
flicted the worst defeat in its history 
upon the German airforce. 

Russian and American forces were 
reported only 150 miles from a junc- 
tion which would cut the Reich in 
two. 

Carrying the air offensive into the 
4th straight day, our planes destroyed 
at least 336 German planes on the 
ground and shot down 41 in combat. 

Meanwhile an Associated Press dis- 
patch from Muelhausen said that 
American troops captured 285 mem- 
bers of the German foreign ministry 
staff when the United States armor 
advanced so swiftly that the staff had 
no time to flee. Foreign Minister 
von Ribbentrop and others of the 
ministry's top figures were not 
among the captives. 

Another frontline dispatch said 
General Omar N. Bradley's Twelfth 
Army group has taken its one 
millionth prisoner since D-day. 

Other front dispatches said the 
First Army is only 60 miles from the 
Elbe River, while Ninth Army troops 
are mopping up isolated resistance 
in captured Hannover. 

The American Third Army was 
within 2V> miles of Erfurt and within 
3 miles of Coburg, only 50 miles 
from the Czechoslovakian frontier. 

In the north, British forces ripped 
a hole in German Elbe River de- 
fenses only 60 miles from Hamburg, 
while other British units advancing 
on Hamburg were only 50 miles from 
the city. Bremen, now under seige, 
is burning. 

Canadians across the Ems River 
were 25 miles from the U-boat base 
of Emden and 15 miles' from the 
North Sea. 

The Ruhr pocket, where more than 
100,000 Nazis are trapped, was nar- 
rowed to 2,000 square miles, while 
Allied headquarters raised its esti- 
mate of Germans trapped in Holland 
to "'well over 100,000." 

The American Seventh Army drove 
within 4 miles of Schweinfurt and 
the French First took Stuttgart. 

JAPANESE ATTACK REPULSED 

Melbourne — Heavy fighting conti- 
nues between Australian and Jap- 
anese troops on southern Bougain- 
ville in the Solomons. A strong Jap- 
anese bayonet attack was repulsed. 
Japanese artillery is shelling Austra- 
lian positions on the Soraken Penin-

KOENIGSBURG 
FALLS AFTER 
6 WEEK SEIGE 

Moscow— Koenigsburg, home 
of German militarism and capi- 
tal of East Prussia was taken 
by the Russians yesterday, 
as other Soviet forces captured 
the center of Vienna, Austrian 
capital. 

Formal surrender of Koenigs- 
burg was made last night after 
more than six weeks of seige. 
Stalin said that 27,000 prison- 
ers were taken, including the 
garrison commander, 

Bloody hand to hand encounters, 
shelling and grenade fighting swept 
through Vienna's entire area south 
of the Danube. 

Moscow dispatches said that Rus- 
sian shock troops have overwhelmed 
three quarters of Vienna and are 
within 8 to 12 milea of encircling the 
city. Other Russian forces, mean- 
whilei mercilessly pounded Brcslau, 
lower Silesia, which has been encir- 
cled and under siege for several weeks. 

The last major highway escape for 
Germans in Vienna was threatened 
by Russian cavalry units teaming 
with American Sherman tanks who 
drove within 9 miles of the Vienna 
Bruenn highway,

Paris— Five hundred casualties have ^™^ lc JS w S 
in the last 10 days and the 1"^™*™ =jg«^™ Way 
trapping thousands of Germans still ?n the Netherlands, _ 

Yesterday, American Ninth and 
British Second armies were within 
sight of the shelled and burning north 
German cities of Hannover and Bre- 
men, These troops are within oO 
miles of the Elbe River at Hamburg 
and 70 miles from Madgeburg. The 
Elbe is the last flat country water 
barrier leading to Berlin and flows 
within 50 miles of the German 
capital. 

Press dispatches said that the fall 
of both Hannover and Bremen were 
Imminent, with the Germans fighting 
stubbornly for Bremen, one of their 
greatest ports and shipbuilding cen- 
ters. Tanks have by-passed both 
cities, hopelessly outflanking them. 

Ninth Army troops stormed into 
the streets of the Huhr industrial 
city of Essen, home of the Krupp 
gun plant, and also into Dortmund 
and Gelsenkirchen. The Krupp works 
were probably the most pulverized 
spot in Germany. Not a wheel has 
turned there since March 11, when 
R.A.F. bombers demolished the fac- 
tory. To the south the SeVenth Army 
is within 94 miles of Munich and 170 
miles from Hitler's mountain fast- 
ness of Berchtesgardcn, 

The Canadians have wrested con- 
trol of North Holland communications 
after a successful joining with Allied 
airborne troops. 400 square miles 
were flooded by the Germans, who 
exploded the dikes* Our First Army 
was 140 miles southwest of Berlin

Murphy's opinion also said: 
"That affirmative answer in my 
estimation is compelled in good mea- 
ure by practical considerations. The 
noral and legal obligations owed the 
'hilippincs by the United States are, 
iO far as I am aware, merciless. 

"The United States is committed 
so a policy of granting complete in- 
lependence to the Philippines. It has 
liready granted their people and their 
officials a large measure of auto- 
nomy. But until the sovereignty of 
.he United States is finally^ with- 
Irawn, restricted power over them is 
■esponsible for their welfare. 

"Since the islands were ceded to 
js, we have at once fostered their 
economic development through prefe- 
rential trade agreements .and their 
lesires for freedom and independence. 
Their industries and agriculture have 
gradually been adjusted in contem- 
plation of their eventual sovereign 
ndependence. 

"But the war has stricken their 
land and their peoples. Their grow- 
ing economy has been largely deci- 
mated by over three years of ruth- 
'ess invasion and occupation. Filipi- 
nos in countless numbers have yielded 
up not only their property but their 
'ives and their liberties. Their eco- 
nomic and social structure has fallen 
about them in ruins. 

"Now with the islands liberated, 
our moral and legal obligations are 
greater than ever before. Our res- 
ponsibility for providing relief and 
rehabilitation has been readily as- 
sumed. But a more complex and 
difficult duty of helping to recons- 
truct the Philippine economic struc- 
ture remains to be fulfilled," 
Murphy's opinion said. 

He added that it was his view, that 
if it is reasonably possible to do so, 
we should avoid construction of the 
term "imports" in a way that would 
place Philippine products at a dis- 
advantage on the American market, 
to the advantage of products from 
other countries, or that might be a 
means of impeding economic rehabi- 
litation of the Philippines.

WILA SURGEON TELLS HOW JAPANESE 
JRDERED WHOLE FAMILIES IN PASAY 



FREE PHILIPPINES 



Page a 



he shocking murder by Japanese 
ers of 16 people, mostly Filipinos, 
>ax Court, 176 Balagtas, Pasay 
February was testified to, re- 
ly, by Dr. Walter K. Frankel, a 
ila surgeon, before military auth- 
es. Dr. Frankel, himself, narrow- 
scaped a horrible death from 
ling and hand grenades while 
rs including small children 
shed. 

r. Frankel said that he was sit- 
at his office table with his wife 
sister when a Japanese sergeant 
iked at the door. Frankel showed 
soldier his official pass, but the 
mese ordered all three out of the 
;e. At the moment, other Jap- 
e soldiers were hauling people out 
ther houses at the bayonet's point, 
captives' hands were tied and all 
3 then driven to a sala in Balag- 
St., Pasay. 

rhe moment we were bound it be- 
e clear to me that they would 
der us", Frankel explained. "My 
» and I kissed farewell, and as we 
sred the house were ordered to 
2I down, face to the wall. Because 
a broken leg I could not kneel, 
lay on my left side permitting me 
ee what the Japanese were doing, 
y put furniture around us, heaped 
lions, pillows, strawbags on them, 
1 poured gasoline over all from 
les. Two soldiers were so em- 
red while the third, a sergeant, 
ked a cigar and observed their 
k. As the place was set in 
aes, the sergeant threw a hand 
lade almost directly at his vic- 
5. Apparently it was his inten- 
to burn us alive. 

due person, Justice Villareal, was 
lediately killed by the grenade. 

that moment Mrs. Villareal 
ped up screaming, then fell dead, 
fc through the head as the three 
anese soldiers, guns in hand, 
ked entrance to the room. My 



wife, lying on my sister's back, rais- 
ing her head, was shot through the 
neck and died immediately, her blood 
flowing over me in streams. Another, 
Mrs. Luerse, was shot dead because 
she moved, and her husband, near 
me asked 'Is my wife dead?' When 
I confirmed it, he said 'thank God.' 

Frankel's hands were untied by a 
Filipino housegirl who escaped with 
another girl from upstairs when the 
floor was in flames. The smoke, be- 
coming unbearable, Frankel, his sis- 
ter, Dr. Luese and his little daughter, 
hands still tied, jumped through the 
flames, expecting to be shot outside. 
The Japanese killers had left the 
room, too, but the thick smoke in the 
court permitted the escaped prisoners 
to flee unseen. They took refuge in 
a garage near the house. Frankel 
obtained a knife in the kitchen and 
cut the bindings of his three com- 
panions. The group once more es- 
caped, this time to hide in an air- 
raid shelter of a large house sixty 
meters distant. During the night, 
Dr. Luerse's 8 year old daughter 
died suddenly from the effects of the 
suffocating smoke and a weakened 
heart. 

Following this tragedy, Frankel, 
placed the child's body into a hole 
in the garden. Then the remainder 
of the tortured band crept into the 
servants' quarters of the big house. 
They hid there, expecting momentary 
death, for a full day, when an Amer- 
ican patrol rescued them. Dr. Luerse, 
unable to walk because of burned legs 
and weakness, was taken to an am- 
bulance on a stretcher. An officer 
gave Frankel a stretcher to bear 
those waiting behind to the am- 
bulance. On the way back Frankel 
and two Filipino assistants were fired 
upon by Japanese snipers. Frankel 
took shelter again for half an hour 
in an undestroyed house in Leveriza 
street. When he emerged he found

Unit, composed of American and Filipino officials. 



the ambulance had gone, but was told 
his sister had been taken by the Cap- 
tain to a hospital. 

Dr. Frankel was then taken by 
American soldiers to Mandaluyong to 
find a nearby evacuation camp. Here 
he encountered fresh tribulations. 
Asking the direction to the evacua- 
ion camp, a Filipino instead delivered 
Frankel to a guerrilla headquarters. 
A German Jew, he was kept in cus- 
tody under suspicion of being a Ger- 
man spy. Frankel, a professor in the 
College of Medicine, University of 
the Philippines, was politely released 
after being identified by a former 
student of the University. 

Two days later, Frankel discovered 
his sister confined in the Quezon Ins- 
titute for treatment of infected burns. 



He said that he believed that fifteen 
people who fled for shelter in a neigh- 
boring house of Mr. Sy were mur- 
dered by burning and hand grenade 
explosions. Only Frankel and his 
sister survived death in the fire and 
explosions in his doomed group. He 
thought that the fifteen in the other 
group, whose cries he heard from the 
neighboring house, consisted of two 
members of the Campos family, 
Spaniards, five persons of the Arros 
family and eight of the Ocainpos 
family. 

Frankel declared that his own 
future will be dedicated to avenging 
the murderers, and that if Japanese 
prisoners were in the Rizal Memorial 
Stadium he would find our murderers 
with absolute certainty."

ment against the enemy in the Philip- 
pine area between December 8, 1941, 
and June 15, 1942, or who was sta- 
tioned in that area for not less than 
30 days during that period. 

The Liberation ribbon may be worn 
by servicemen who participated in the 
initial landings on Leyte or adjoin- 
ing islands from October 17 to Octo- 
ber 20, 1944; who took part in any 
engagement against the enemy during 
the campaign or who served in the 
islands or on ships in Philippine 
waters for not less than 30 days be- 
tween October 17, 1944 and a later

Fil-American Forces 
Operate Field Hospital 
In Laguna-Tayabas Area 

The Fil-American guerrilla forces 
under Col. Hugh Straughn maintains 
a field hospital and a corps of nurses 
in the front line in the Laguna-Taya- 
bas sector according to Miss Pacita 
T. Paguio, a USAFFE nurse who re- 
turned to the city last night from 
the Laguna-Tayabas front. 
, She said the guerrilla field hospi- 
tal, under Dr. Alvaro Gutierrez, a 
USAFFE medical officer, is taking 
care of scores of casualty cases, both 
Americans and Filipinos. Its im- 
provised ambulance and stretcher 
service in the front lines under the 
management of experienced physi- 
cians and nurses has been responsi- 
ble for the saving of many lives. 

In the beginning of the present 
campaign, the guerrilla field hospital 
was located in Pila, Laguna. But as 
the front lines advanced deeper into 
the Sierra Madre sector in Tayabas, 
the hospital was transferred to Santa 
Cruz, Laguna, which is now comolete- 



HOUSE RENTALS FIXED 
AT PRE-WAR LEVELS 

The 25 per cent increase in house 
rental approved by the cabinet some- 
time ago was only an emergency 
measure, without legal force, accord- 
ing to Eugenio S. de Gracia, officer 
in charge of the house rental price 
control division of the Manila police 
department. The rates now in effect 
are those of December 8, 1941, by 
virtue of President Osmena's Execu- 
tive Order No. 24. 

Complaints against profiteering 
landlords are now handled by the 
price control division. De Gracia said 
that meritorious complaints on the 
part of tenants will be entertained 
by his division and corresponding cri- 
minal complaints against landlords 
violating Executive Order No. 24 will 
be filed in court at once.

AMERICA AND THE PHILIPPINES 

Writing a concurring opinion in a United States Supreme Court decision 
thw week, Justice Frank Murphy applied on unusual word to Philippine- 
Anierican relationships, Although Murphy's obiter DICTU does not bear 
the force of law, its inclusion in a Supreme Court decision gives it an 
importance that it could never have attained otherwise. 

"Tlie nit/rat and legal obligations owed the Philippines are, so far as I 
am riwdtet merciless" said Justice Murphy, who was the last Governor 
General unci the first High Commissioner in the Philippines. 

h'tuhk Murphy's friendship for the Filipino people is well known* It 
u'ita a$?ain illustrated when he wrote, in this week's Supreme Court decision, 
that. America's "moral and legal obligations are greater than ever before. 1 ' 
7 .statement that those obligations are "merciless" however, is farther 
than any responsible American official lias ever gone in discussing Philip 
pnte- American relations. 

it shoim that American interest in the Philippines and American 
determination to treat the Filipinos squarely, have not abated.

RESTAURANTS WARNED 
NOT TO REDUCE MEALS 
TO BEAT PRICE LAWS 

The reduction of quality or quan- 
it; of food served in restaurants is 
just as much of an offense as sell- 
in tr the goods above controlled prices," 
l-rhrod Maj. H. M. Parker, chief 
the price control division of the 
1 r ce department yesterday. "Such 
kl" he added, "Is just as bad as 
weighing a customer in the 
ket If the sizes of the orders 
are cut in half the price must also 
be reduced proportionately." 

JVice control supervisors and 
agents have observed that after the 
new ceiling prices for foodstuffs were 
1 ased by the office of President 
ena, some restaurant owners lost 
ao r-ime in reducing the quantity and 
quality of the fond they sell in order 
to beat the price control law. Del- 
fin F. Bntacan, price control agent, 
has observed that the rice cakes now 
sold in the restaurants have shrunk 
to almost one half of their former 
sizes and the coffee cups are very 
much smaller than those used before 
the price control law went into effect 
Restaurant owners reducing the 
quality or quantity of their orders 
will be criminally prosecuted in 
court just like any profiteer, accord 
mi to Major Parker.

y Holiday For Shaw 
itil Japan Is Beaten 

x>ndon— George Bernard Shaw, 
ed how he planned celebrating the 
of the European war, declared: 

'I do not intend to celebrate it at 
The war will not be over on 
Day'\ It will go on for a long 
e against Japan." 



the American Ninth Army, which 
took Brunswick in its stride and raced 
on to Madgeburg on the Elbe River, 
in a 50 mile advance in 24 hours. 
Front dispatches placed the 
First A(rmy f which is linked with 
the Ninth and Third only 140 
miles from a junction with Rus- 
sian lines to the northeast. One 
report said the Russians and 
Americans were only 110 mites 
apart at one point 
First Army troops entered Nord- 
hausen on the southern slopes of the 
Harz mountains within 57 miles of 
Leipzig and 110 miles from Berlin. 

The 11th Armored Division of Gen- 
eral Patton's Third Army captured 
Coburg and pushed on. To the north, 
British forces west of Bremen were 
30 miles from the Heligoland bight, 
and 12 miles northwest of their Weser 
River bridgehead. Canadians fought 
across the Issel River in Holland, 
threatening the great dutch ports of 
Amsterdam and Rotterdam, 

Essen, the great munitions capital 
of the Ruhr fell to American airborne 
troops. So rapid was the unprece- 
dented Allied advance everywhere in 
the west that the principal difficulty 
was maintaining supply lines. 



Spain Ends Diplomatic 
Relations With Japan 

Madrid— Spain today severed diplomatic relations with 
fapan, in what was apparently an aftermath of the 
silling of Spanish nationals by Japanese soldiers at Manila- 

It was reported the Spanish government would hold 
Japanese Minister Yakichiro Suma and other Japanese 
liplomats until Tokyo arranges the safe departure of 
Spanish diplomats from Japanese capital. 

On March 24th the Spanish government accused Japan 
)f the wanton killing of a large number of Spanish citizens 
md the destruction of considerable Spanish property in 
Manila, 



American infantrymen 
on southern Okinawa regained the 
foothold they had lost to Japanese 
counterattacks as clearing skies set 
the stage for ground fighting of in- 
creased fury- 
Abatement of the heavy rainfall 
brought a slight decrease in the artil- 
lery "fire on both sides, hottest of any 
Pacific campaign. 

One American regiment, which had 
been receiving heavy artillery punish- 
ment, jumped off early Wednesday to 
assault the ridge northeast of Kaka- 
z\i on the heavily fortified Japanese 
lines stretching along Okinawa la- 
land. They met stiff mortar, machine- 
gun and small arms fire, but gained 
the top of the ridge for the second 
time in three days. At last reports, 
they were consolidating their posi- 
tions. 

The Japanese commander at Kaka- 
zu abandoned all ideas of passive 
resistance and counterattacked when- 
ever ground was lost along the 7,000 
yard front. 



Vatican Charges Japs 
With P. I. Destruction 

ROME — The premises of the Apos- 
tolic Delegation in Manila were com- 
pletely destroyed and plundered by 
Japanese troops during their occupa- 
tion of the city, the Vatican Ptess 
Service announced yesterday. 

This announcement said that the 
Japanese had burned down all the 
delegation buildings and destroyed 
all archives and documents. It was 
the first direct news received by the 
Holy t See since the recent fighting in 
Manila. 

Monsignor William Piaoi, apostolic 
delegate to the Philippines and Guam 
was reported safe at Manila's Bene- 
dictine Convent, the report added. 



Speedy Stroke 
By MacArthur 
Surprises Japs 

Units of the veteran Amer- 
ica! Division, in another swift 
amphibious stroke which caught 
the Japanese by surprise, land- 
ed on Bohol Island Wednesday 
morning, the last of the Visayan 
islands to be liberated, General 
MacArthur announced today. 

The Eighth Army forces stormed 
ashore at 7:30 a.m. near Tagbilaran, 
under strong naval and air support, 
and rapidly drove inland "before the 
surprised enemy could rally his 
strength/' the communique said. 
Local guerrilla forces are aiding in 
the operation* 

Elsewhere in the Philippines, 14th 
Corps troops advanced 30 miles in 
southern Luzon on the east coast of 
the Bicol peninsula, closing a trap 
on the remaining enemy forces. East 
of Manila, other units continued the 
steady reduction of cave positions in 
the upper Marikina River area. At 
least 257 enemy dead were counted 
in one cave recently sealed in the 
Bosoboso River sector. 

In the air, MacArthur's bombers 
and fighters attacked enemy defenses 
near Davao and inland on Mindanao, 
"causing much damage," and damaged 
two small vessels in the "almost de- 
serted" China Sea areas. 



Russians Wh eel 
Beyond Vienna 
And Head West 

Moscow— With most of Vienna in 
their hands and the city completely 
encircled to bar escape of the remain- 
ing Nazi garrison troops, the Rus- 
sians wheeled a big force of Cossack 
cavalry up to the Berlin front yes- 
terday. 

Front dispatches said the Russians 
had taken half of the last German 
toehold in the Austrian capital, cross- 
ing the Danube River and overrun- 
ning much of the area between the 
canal and the river, Much booty and 
more than 2,000 prisoners* were cap- 
tured. 

While the Soviets cut the last escape 
route for the Germans from Vienna, 
other Red Army troops invaded the 
Czechoslovakia war production center 
of Moravia within 35 miles of the 
arsenal city of Bruenn,

Soviets Head For Munich, Prague 
To Link Up With Allies In The West 



London— Russian forces yesterday 
were reported beyond Vienna, head- 
ing for the strongholds of Munich 
and Prague, in a linkup with Allies 
in the west, as Soviet storm units 
within Vienna were driving Germans 
from the last few blocks of the city. 
Moscow radio said that the complete 
fall of the city was imminent 

Yesterday's capture of Koenigs- 
bntg on the Baltic coast, cradle of 
Prussian militarism, was hailed by 
the Russian press as one of the great 



victories of the war and comparable 
to the breaching of the Siegfried Line 
in the west. It was revealed that the 
east Prussian capital collapsed after 
the Russians hurled a massive 33 hour 
barrage at it, softening: three lines of 
fortifications surrounding the city. 

Russian dispatches reported that 
Marshal Tolbukhin's 3rd, Ukrainian 
Army had crossed the Danube im- 
mediately northwest of Vienna near 
Dusscldorf and were now believed to 
be crossing 12 miles upstream in the 
vicinity of Tulfend.

SWEDEN SHUTS DOOR 
TO NAZI REFUGEES 

London— Sweden has shut the door 
to fleeing Germans, a move designed 
to prevent German war criminals 
from slipping into that country in dis- 
guise, according to a press dispatch 
todiry, German refugees who arrived 
recently in Sweden will be deported 
unless they are deserters from the 
German armed forces or are in poor 
health, the Swedish government said. 
Switzerland is now the only neutral 
haven adjoining German or German 
occupied areas for their refugees. 

A Bern broadcast said that Swit- 
zerland welcomes innocent victims of 
the war but bluntly added she was 
determined not to "accept on her 
territory any foreigners who have 
trespassed elementary bounds of 
decency."

TOLENTINO SUGGESTS 
SLIDING PRICE SCALE 

Batangas Congressman Miguel To- 
lentino hag asked that city mayors 
and municipal executive be given 
authority to increase or decrease 
ceiling prices of daily commodities, 
in accordance with the food situation 
and transportation facilities in their 
respective jurisdictions. 

In a memorandum sent to Presi- 
dent Osmena, Mr, Tolentino suggest- 
ed that Executive Order No. 24, fix- 
ing prices of commodities, be am- 
mended to minimize profiteering by 
making prices just and fair. 

The increase in price should not 
exceed 100 per cent and the decrease 
should not be more than 20 per cent 
according to the memorandum. 

Air And Naval Strength 
Of Japan Believed Broken 

Okinawa — Correspondents' dis- 
patches yesterday indicated that the 
main Japanese air and naval strength

warships and 417 planes. 

Admiral Mitscher said: "I believe 
Japan's fleet and entire airforce 
decidedly on the wane." * iriorce 13

Escaped Woman Describes 
ap Reign Of Terror In Lipa 



Fag* 8 



gscaping from Japanese military 
ice who tortured and killed her 
3bsnd ae a guerrilla supporter, 
a, Rosario Musca de Melgarejo 
•ountered mare hardships and suf- 
ings in Lipa, Batangas, to which 
\ evacuated with her children, she 
icrted on her return to Manila last 
■ht 

Although she barely escaped with 
• life, she lost three nieces who were 
tgged away by Jap soldiers. 
Mrs. Melgarejo said she left the 
1 last January after being tipped 

that she was on the list of the 
sanese military police and would 
picked up anytime. In Batangas, 
) stayed in Barrio Anilao until the 
aerican liberating forces arrived, 
\ the Japs didn't leave Lipa with- 
: turning the city, killing most of 
s male inhabitants and raping 
■ny young girls and women, 
'During the reign of terror in Lipa 
t month, families were separated 
the confusion, 1 ' she said. "Those 
to escaped alive run to the barrios, 
t the Japs followed thorn; Some- 
ie during the latter part of March, 
3 Japs encircled Barrio Anilao. 
e men ran to the sugarcane fields 
d laid flat on their stomachs to 
:ape capture. Seeing that there 
re no male folks, the japs lined up 

the women and picked from their

tong the lot* It was in this manner 
it I lost my three nieces," she said. 
Nat all the men who hid in the 
le fields escaped, she said. The 
ps discovered their hiding places 
i raked the fields with machine- 
[i fire. The hysterical cries of the 
men who were raped and after- 
xds bayonetted to death mingled 
th the groans and shrieks of the 



men as they were blasted by machine-^ 
guns. To make sure, that nobody es- " 
caped, they set fire to the cane fields, 
Mrs. Melgarejo, said, 

In Barrio Lodlod, which was a Ma~ 
kapili and Sakdal territory, the Japs 
pursued a different form of mass 
murder. To get all the people in one 
place, they asked tKem to line up fnr 
[•asses which would get them across 
the Japanese line in Batangasf to 
safety. While the people were in line, 
chey were mowed down by machine- 
qun fire. Around 600 men, women 
and children were killed in this man- 
ner Mrs. Melgarejo reported. 

When she finally succeeded in leav* 
ing Lipa, the American forces had 
already driven the enemy away to his 
customary position in the hills. But 
the once aristocratic Lipa with its 
homes of old Spanish architecture 
and its old and socially prominent 
families was virtually wiped out, Mrs, 
Melgarejo said. Lipa is in ruins like 
in any other cities and towns of the 
Philippines.

matton will recommend the creation 
of a copra office or the reopenim- 
of the NACOCO (National Coconut 
Corporation) even if only a skeleton 
force can be employed. 

Secretary Kalaw who is himself a 
coconut planter, reported that copra 
experts from the United States con- 
tracted by the Commonwealth govern- 
ment are arriving in Manila soon to 
help restore the coconut industry. 

Of the many cash crops of the 
islands, coconut and hemp have been 
chosen for earliest rehabilitation in 
view of the relative ease with which 
these crops can be harvested and 
processed, 

Malacanan sources opined that the 
rehabilitation of the coconut and hemp 
industries will relieve to a great ex- 
tent the nation-wide unemployment 
and sufferipjy. 

It was pointed out that su^ar, the 
country's leading export crop, would 
be harder to restore to its pre-war 
importance. Neglected sugar lands 
would have to be fertilized before they 
can be planted. It would take time 
to get a cane crop ready for mill- 
inff, and the restoration of sugar cen- 
trals as well as the processing of 
cane juice will take morp time.

frequently differed with their Filipino friends on questions of immediA^e 
ihvmHamet but basically they worked toward the same goal. 

They could have fled to the safety of the United S ates when war came, 
but they chose to remain in their adopted homes and brave the wrath of the

Dr> Luther Bewley t former director of education who haB spent hie en-

"The infinite kindness of friends during my enforced sojourn at Santo

Consumers Asked To Aid 

In Stopping Inflation 

CoL M. E. Jones, chief of police, 
yesterday suggested a way the pub- 
lic can help law enforcement agencies 
in their campaign to bring the prices 
of commodities and services down. 

In the campaign against bars and 
restaurants, for instance, the chief 
of police suggested that a person who 
has been served and charged a price 
higher than that in the list of ceiling 
prices may effectively aid by secur- 
ing a signed receipt from the estab- 
lishment and mailing it to the price 
control division with a statement of 
the facts and crcumstances surround*

U.S. Armies 50 Miles from Berlin 



TRUMAN SWORN 
IN AS PRESIDENT 

WASHINGTON — Messages of condolence began 
pouring into the White House last night from a shocked 
and saddened world, stunned by the sudden death of 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt Thursday afternoon (5:30 
a.m. Friday, Manila time.) 

The president, who died as American armies were 
pounding at the gates of Berlin and were standing at the 
doorstep to Tokyo, passed away at his summer home in 
Warms Springs, Ga., of a cerebral hemorrhage. 

The only president of the United States ever to be 
elected for four terms, and a 
world-wide symbol of fighting 
democracy, his death imme- 
diately set off a wave of deep 
mourning throughout the globe. 

As soon as word of the 
president's death was received 
in Manila, the flag at General 
MacArthur's residence was low- 
ered to half-staff. Government 
offices and establishments fol- 
lowed the same procedure. 
Theater performances here were 
cancelled and special masses 
were scheduled. 

Harry S. Truman, President 
Roosevelt's running mate in the 
last election, was sworn in as president of the United 
States by Chief Justice Harlan Fisk Stone last night at 
7 p.m. 

The scene was the cabinet room in the Executive 
offices of the White House. Truman read his oath from 
a slip of white paper, swearing to uphold the constitution. 
To his left was Mrs. Truman and their daughter. 

Late last night, President Truman issued the follow- 
ing statement: 

"The world may be sure that we will prosecute the 

fronts,

irs, swung around Magdeburg, then crossed the

'arther south, American Third Army tanks were 
*d entering Halle by Allied reconnaissance pilots. 



This would place General Patton's spearheads within 50 
miles of the German capital from the southwest. 

Within the past nineteen days, the Ninth drove 240 
miles from the Rhine to the Elbe at an average rate of 
nearly 20 miles a day. 

At the northern end of the Western Front, German 
lines crumbled before the British Second Army near 
Bremen, and fell apart in northern Holland under at- 
tacks from Canadian tank columns.

west, with all the vigor we pos- 
sess to a successful conclusion." 

Meanwhile cabinet officers, 
senators, and public figures 
throughout the United States 
joined in tribute to the late 
president. Secretary of State 
Stettinius, declared that "a great 
tragedy has come to America

Water Consumers 
To Be Billed As 
Conservation Act

supply of Manila, according to Gen- 
eral Manager Ambrosia Magsaysay

Manager Magsaysay declared that

Hassefc said, that Mr. Roosevelt 
made his usual comment as he sign- 



ed, "Here is where I make a law," 

The President's mail was quite 
heavy on his last day and "it took 
some twenty minutes sign papers/' 
Hassett added. 

Other papers Mr, Roosevelt signed

E DITORIA L 

A FRIEND OF THE FILIPINOS 

The Philippines joins the whole world in mourning the death 
of President Roosevelt, His loss will he fdt from Aparri to 
Tawi-Tawi For despite his preoccupation with Europe and with 
the larger aspects of international relations, Mr, Roosevelt was 
a sincere friend of the Philippines, 

Just a week before he died he had a conference toith Presi- 
dent Osrnena in which American intentions to deal fairly and 
xqttarriy with the Philippines were reemphasized. President 
Poosevelt told President Osmena that he believed independence 
should be granted in advance of the stipulated date of July 4, 
T9i6 t and pledged anew his country's determination to help re- 
construct the Philippi7m after the horrors of the war had passed. 

President Roosevelt always wanted to visit the Philippines 
and frequently told Filipino leaders in Washington of his desire. 
It's a pity that the demands of his great office made it impossible 
for the Filipinos to show, by their hospitality, their appreciation 
of the interest that Mr. Roosevelt always showed in their problems. 




Judge Mabana* Explains Reasons 
For Charge in Poison Liquor Case 

Antero Lara, accused of multiple homicide in the Manila court of first 
instance for having sold alleged poison liquor to five American sol- 
diers, "did net have the least intention of causing them injury, much 
less killing: his American guests/' declared Judge Alejo Mabanag, chief 
city prosecuting attorney, The$- 
statement answered President Fran- 
cisco Capistrano's contention, pub- 
lished in this paper, that five instead 
of one separate complaints for mur- 
der should have been filed against 
Lara. 

According to Judge Mabanag, no 
evidence in "the preliminary investiga- 
tion showed that Lara knew the al- 
cohol used in preparing the beverage 
was methyl alcohol. On the contra- 
ry, Pgt Arvfllt Kinjr, companion of 
the dead soldiers, testified during the 
investigation that Lara would "test 
each drink by tasting it himself be- 
fore giving it to me," 

''In view of the above facts and 
findings/' Judge M aba nag concluded, 
attorney filed only one information 
"the office of the city prosecuting 
for multiple homicide through reck- 
less negligence because, in our opi- 
nion, the death of the five victims 
was the result of only one act of 
criminal negligence/' 



Labor Groups Urge 
Early Independence 

Labor leaders representing three 
labor unions of Manila has approved 
a resolution to be addressed to the 
President and Congress of the United 
States advocating Philippine inde- 
pendence on August 13 as sought by 
President Osrnena or on July 4 T 1946 
as provided for by the Tydings-Mc- 
Htiffie Act. 

The resolution was drafted by a 
committee headed by Dr. Pedro Ve- 
iasco and created at fl recent meet- 
ing of labor leaders representing the 
Confederated Workers Alliance, Na- 
tional Federation of Labor and the 
National "Workers Brotherhood* 



Notarial Commissions 
For Attorneys Asked 

Secretary Delfin Jaranilla of the 
department of justice has wired 
President Sergio Osmena in Wash- 
ington to authorize the executive 
judge of Manila to issue notarial 
commissions to city attorneys. This 
authority from the President is nec- 
essary, he said, in view of the fact 
that the supreme court which issues 
such commissions has not yet been 
organized. 

Til the case of provincial lawyers, 
they can secure their notarial com- 
missions from the judge of the court 
of first instance of their respective 
provinces. Since there are no auth- 
Q $™*$ notaries in Manila at present, 
officials directly appointed by the 
^resident may administer oaths and 
authenticate documents.

He reminded property owners that they are held 
equally responsible with the tenants for payment 
of water charges. Water District officials ex- 
plained the lack of water in some sections Satur-

Washington— The body of

shed the White House at 
14 a.m. Saturday after mov- 
th rough ; hushed capital

asands.

route, women dropped to their

2 German Cruisers 
Believed Damaged 

London— The German heavy crui- 
sers Admiral Hipper and Evidenwre 
believed damaged in the British bomb- 
ins of Kiel April 9 when the pocket 
battleship Admired Scheer was sunk, 
the British Air Ministry announced 
last night. 

The two cruisers were the largest 
ships remaining in Hitter's crippled 
navy. ' 



Heavy military and civilian traffic, jamming the Jones Street bridge 
in the heart of Manila, was considerably lightened Saturday morning when 
the new Santa Cruz bridge over the Pasig River was opened to general 
traffic. 

Engineers of the 841st. Aviation Battalion of the Luzon District, work- 
ing under the handicap of lack of materials and a labor shortage, completed 
the job in the remarkably fast time <' 
of 12 days. 

The Santa Cruz is the third bridge 
spanning the Pasig which has been 
erected by the Luzon Engineer Dis- 
trict under wartime hardship. Jones 
Bridge was completed shortly after 
Manila was liberated. Quezon bridge 
has been in operation for several 
weeks, there now remain the tasks 
of making the Ayala and Santa 
Ana spans workable. All were dyna- 
mited by the Japanese and the 'twist- 
ed wreckage plunged into the Pasig 
during the struggle for Manila. The 
Engineers expect to finish both the 
Ayala and Santa Ana bridges by 
June 30th., before the rainy season 
commences. 

The Jones, Quezon and Santa Cruz 
are Bailev bridges of the pontoon 
type, a British-American wartime 
invention to almost magically replace 
structures that have been dynamited 
by the enemy.

Mac Arthur s Troops 
Advance On Baguio 
From 3 Directions 

During the past week, Ameri- 
can forces have killed an addi- 
tional 8,156 Japanese troops 
and taken 205 more prisoners in 
the Philippines, General Mac- 
Arthur announced today. 

This brings total Japanese casual- 
ties since the Liberation campaign 
began last October, to 321,827. 

Meanwhile, on Luzon, MacArthur's 
forces were converging on Baguio 
from three directions, south, west and 
northwest. As they moved toward 
the Philippines summer capital and 
present seat of the pupet government, 
the Americans systematically reduced 
enemy positions in the rugged sur- 
rounding terrain. 

In southern Luzon, the American 
forces cleared Cagraray Island off 
the east coast of Albay. 

In the air our bombers and fighters 
closely supported the ground troops 
in all sectors, dropping 400 tons of 
bombs. 

The drives to clear Negros and 
Cebu of enemy remnants were being 
pressed, and on Mindanao, American 
planes hit Davao and vicinity with 
387 tons of bombs, causing wide, 
spread destruction. Enemy traffic 
has been kept ar a standstill by low 
level sweeps over the highway net- 
works. 

Formosa targets took another 
heavy pounding as the daily bombing 
attacks continued with increased fury. 
Tainan and Okayama air centers 
were hit, along with railroad yards 
at Shoka and the Keelung -dock area. 
Large fires were started among 
parked planes, warehouses and rolling 
stock. The Japanese sent no planes 
out to intercept the heavy and me- 
dium bombers, which were fighter es- 
corted, and we lost only one fighter 
to antiaircraft fire. 

On the China Coast, escorted 
heavy bombers his supply terminals at 
Hongkong and in the Canton area, 
dropping 170 tons of explosives. Fuel 
storage tanks and other installations 
were destroyed and a freighter was 
sunk in Hongkong harbor. 



Von Pafien tabbed by Yanks 

Paris — Franz von Papen former German premier and ambassador to 
Turkey was captured by American troops in the Ruhr pocket April 11 
supreme allied headquarters disclosed yesterday. 

The German diplomat, long regarded as a specialist in Nazi political 
"dirty work", was taken at his son-in-lawV home in Stockhausen, 25 miles 
southeast of Hamm. , " 

Von Papen was captured by glider troops mopping up Ruhr pocket, 
which was closed April L, when units of U. S. First and Ninth Armies met 
at Lippstadt on the eastern side of Ruhr dispatches said. 

Since then they have taken 110,000 prisoners from an estimated 150,000 
of German army groups "B" and "G".

Ruhr, Germany — "Germany's 
once rich Kuhr glows like a giant 
torch, aflame from one end to the

vice president Virgil Pinkley de- 
dared yesterday after a 1400 mile

Pinkley said he saw the hope- 
Jess position of Hitler's scattered 
armies and pulverized condition of 
German cities where even cross- 
road farhouses were reduced to 
rubble because they were used for 
defense. Tanks, mortars and ar- 
tillery knocked down entire cities 
and broke every brick twice. 

"I have never seen anything in

neral of the dead president. Truman 

"The leader of his people in a great 
war, he lived to see the assurance of 
:he victory but not to share it. He 
lived to see the firs foundations of 
the free and peaceful world to which 
his life was dedicated but not to enter 
on that world himself. His feflow 
countrymen will sorely miss his for- 
titude and courage in time to come- 

"The people of the earth who love 
the w^avs of freedom and hope will 
mourn for him, but though his voicr- 
•s silent, his courage is not spent, hi? 
faith not extinguished. The courage 
of great men outlives them to be-

poses and their hopes to the task. 1 '

Prime Minister Churchill declarer! 
the death of President Roosevelt was 
die loss of the British nation and of 
the »cause of freedom in every land. 
He said in a message to Mrs, Roose- 
velt; "I. feel so deeply for you all, 
As for myself, I have lost a dear and 
cherished friendship which was forged 
in the fire of war, 1 trust you may 
find comfort in the glory of his name 
and in the magnitude of his work," 
In a message to Truman, Premier 
Stalin said: "On behalf of the 
Soviet government and myself, per- 
sonally, I express our profound con- 
dolence to the government of the 
United States of America on the occa- 
sion of the premature death of Presi- 
dent Roosevelt. The American peo- 
ple and the United Nations have lost 
in Franklin D. Roosevelt a great 
political leader of world significance 
and a pioneer in the organization of 
peace and security after the war. 
The government of the Soviet Union 
expresses its sincere sympathy to the 
American people in their #reat loss 
ind its conviction that the policy of 
friendship between the great powers 
who are shouldering the main burden 
the war against the common enemy 
will continue in the future,' 1 

From Chungking, Generalissimo 
Chiang Kai-shek messaged: "His 
name and his ideas shall be a beacon 
fJ f light to humanity for centuries to 
come. The sorrow of the Chinese 
people is intensified by a deep sense 
Of gratitude that they bear for him. 
President Roosevelt has firmly laid 
the foundation of a lasting peace as 
well as for the ultimate victory of the 
Allied forces" 

Gen- Charles de Gaulle, president of 
the French provisional government, 
Cellared that "in the heart of all hu- 
manity, Roosevelt was the symbol of 
the great cause .for which the United 
Nations have suffered so much and 
fought so hard— the cause of liberty.

Washington— Unequivocal as* 
surance was given Satxirday by 
Secretary of State Edward R. 
Stettinius Jr,, that the succes- 
sion of President Truman to the 
White House will mean a eonti^ 
nuation of the Roosevelt pro- 
gram to keep the peace for gene- 
rations and to give security and 
wider opportunity to all men* 

"Under President Truman's 
leadership we shall not falter// 
he declared, "either as a govern- 
ment or a people in the accom- 
plishment of these ends for 
which Franklin D. Roosevelt 
gave his life." 



Roosevelt Called 
Filipinos' Friend 

Gen. MacArthur on Friday paid 
high tribute to President Roosevelt as 
the greatest friend of the Filipino 
people. In a statement thanking the 
Philippine cabinet for a resolution 
)f condolence on the death of Roose- 
velt, MacArthur said: 

"The Philippines had no greater 
friend than president Roosevelt. Its 
welfare and future were constantly 
in his uppermost thought. His pre- 
mature death at this critical moment 
"n world's history is a tragedy which 
affects all mankind, He was a great 
liberal, both in thought and "action, 
and the loss of his beneficent and 
powerful influence in shaping the des- 
tinies of the new world which is 
emerging from the ashes of a devas- 
tated civilization is irreparable. The 
American people will be grateful to 
you for sharing their sorrow/ 1 

Earlier President Sergio Osmena 
had sounded a similar note when he 
said: "The nam^ of President Roose- 
velt, so dear to all of us, will always 
be remembered with affection, admi- 
ration and gratitude in the Philip- 
pines."

Cases Is Declining 

Manila is now practicing an emer- 
gency form of "state medicine/ 1 de- 
clared Col, Maurice Fincoffs, city 
health department head, at a meeting 
of the various department heads of 
the city government. 

The functions of the Bureau of 
Health and the City Health Depart- 
ment have been consolidated, and the 
only hospitalization available is prc~ 
vided by the state, said Fincoffs. The 
objective of the authorities in charge 
of the city's health is to close emer- 
gency hospitals erected during com- 
bat and reinstate private hospitals 
in practice. 

At the same meeting, Pincoffs re- 
vealed that the diarrhea and dysen- 
tery cases in the city are declining 
but that the tuberculosis death rati

CONSERVE THE WATER 

During the past few days Manikins have been able to Bee for themselves 
how precarious the water situation is in the capital Although there usually 
km leen wa er in the mains, there have been frequent intervals ^hen il 
would not flow through the pipes due to lack of pressure. t 

Army engineers are doing everything within their power to repatr %m 
facilities destroyed by the Japs and get ihe water system to operating 
again. But the people of Manila ?nust help by conserving every drop oj 
woler. 

Water must not be used for sprinkling streets, wa'ermg lawns, w 
&a\ h,ng cars and buildings. It must be used sparingly for cooking pur 
poses and for only the most essential bathing, cleaning of dishes and wash 
ing oj clothes. 

Above all, taps must' be turned off and leaking faucets must be re 
paired* With six weeks remaining before tjie rains start, water must b* 
conserved or everyone will suffer. 

Wasting water today is as much of a crime as stealing food. It should 
be condemned by public opinion and drastically punished by civil law.

In Water Consumption 



Red Cross Club Will 
Open This Afternoon 

The Manila Enlisted Men's Club, 
the first Red Cross recreational hall 
in this area, will officially open at 
the former Philippine Trust building, 
No. 1 Plaza Goiti, with a party this 
afternoon at three o'clock, according 
to Nyles I Christensen of the Ameri- 
can Red Cross. 

Gen. F. F. Baker, commanding gen 
eral of the Greater Manila area, will 
accept the club on behalf of American 
service men. Mrs. Douglas MacArthur 
and several high ranking Army offi- 
cers are expected to attend the 
opening. 



' Metropolitan Water District officials in 
Manila appealed today for city residents to 
slash their water consumption by half. 

If this is done, water available at present 
in the reservoirs may last until the rainy season, 
v^they said. Previously, water officials 
warned the city's supply would last 
only 20 more days at the present 
rate of consumption. 

The current supply is so low that 
water does not flow in some of the 
mains. Army distribution trucks 
which transport water to various dis- 
tribution points in Manila are handi- 
capped in their work, because many 
residents continued to tamper with 
water hydrants, reducing pressure 
and slowing up the distribution 
service. 



Dropped On Japs 

American infantry continued 
their drive toward the Japanese 
stronghold of Baguio in north- 
ern Luzon through stubborn 
enemy defenses, repulsing num- 
erous counter-attacks, while 
other units to the south smash- 
ed strong pockets of instance 
in the Novaliches-Marikina watershed 
area, General MacArthur reported 
today. 

The fierce air bombardment of Jap- 
anese defenses on Luzon continued at 
full peak, with another 700 tons of 
explosives unloaded within the past 
24 hours, raising the two day total 
to well over 1,000 tons.

of the small island 350 miles below southern 
Japan. 

At the southern end, however, 24th Corps 
Army forces were deadlocked four miles 
above the capital city of Naha for the 
twelfth straight day, amid the fiercest 
artillery duel of the Pacific war. 

Artillery fire broke up three Japanese 
night counterattacks in the southern sector, 
and warships, carrier and land based 
planes continued to render effective sup- 
port, Pacific Fleet headquarters announced. 

On Saturday, yesterday's communique re- 
vealed, American forces went ashore # on 
another island in the Kerama group, just 
west of the southern tip of Okinawa. 

In recent air strikes over the northern 
Ryukyus, Navy bombers damaged a small 
cargo ship and wrecked buildings and radio 
towers on Tanega island 

At the northern end of Okinawa, Marine 
columns moved with ease through the 
rugged mountains beyond Momobaru town 
on the west and Arakawa on the east 
coast. The big Motobu peninsula, where 
Jananese forces had attpnrmt.pd cnuntpr- 
attacks last week, was completely occupied.

Macflrthur's Tribute to Roosevelt 
Mirrors Reverence in Philippines 

General MacArthur's tribute +r> Pyw,;^™*. t>~ J v. r V * • *V ;* . 



DeoDle t 1 Roosevelt, naming him the greatest friend of the Filipino 
people is m agreement with the Filipino nation's love and respect for the dead president. 

No one thought higher of Roosevelt than the average Filipino who had followed and become inspired 
by the great leader's career Since the passing of the president, it has been interesting to note how S 
Filipinos m high government circles and elsewhere linked the name of Abraham Lincoln with that of Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt as the greatest of American presidents. 



It was a keen comparison. It f urn- 
:hed a glowing example of the Ameri- 
democratic spirit that can find 
obility of character and wisdom in 
oth the log cabin of Lincoln and 
1 the mansion of Roosevelt. The 
outhful Lincoln poured over his few 
ooks on the candle-lit cabin floor, 
loosevelt was educated in the illu- 
iinated dormatories of a fashionable 
chool. Yet both now belong to the 
lumni of humankind's outstanding 
enefactors. 

RECOGNIZED WAR SIGNAJLS 

Franklin D. Roosevelt won the 
dmiration of the oppressed peoples 
f Europe and Asia and the Pacific 
s a symbol of deliverance'' from Ger- 
lan and Japanese savagery. He was 
he leader who forged the productive 
light and fighting skill of the Unit- 
d States into an invincible weapon 
f liberation. Roosevelt was the 32nd. 
resident of the United States and 
72ls the first to be elected four times 
d that office. 

Bitter controversy marked his third 
residential campaign. His enemies 
ailed him the wrecker of a sacred 
residential tradition. But it was 
he great American voting public who 
[ecreed there should be a third, even 
t fourth term for the gallant war 
sader. 



Roosevelt early recognized the 
danger signals in Europe and the 
Far East. He warned of need for war 
preparations and eight years before 
America was attacked, he obtained an 
increase in military and naval appro- 
priations. He called early for a 
"quarantine" against aggressor na- 
tions. His Lend-Lease act of 1941 
made the United States the arsenal 
of democratic countries battling the 
Axis powers. The manpower of the 
United States was mobilized into a 
mighty American army with the pass- 
age of the Selective Service Act. 
Roosevelt was the first and foremost 
nation's commander-in-chief devot- 
ing himself to the gigantic problems 
of war production and strategy. 

GIFT FOR TELLING PHRASE 

Now, the U. S. has the most power- 
ful army and navy in the global war. 
Joining with our Allies, they turned 
the tide of battle in the Pacific, swept 
the enemy from Africa, have brought 
Germany to her knees for early sur- 
render, and are poised for the des- 
truction of Japan on the enemy's 
homeland. 

Throughout his brilliant public 
career Roosevelt displayed a gift for 
the telling phrase. He sounded the 
keynote for his administration in his 
inaugural' address with the deathless 



words: "The only thing- we have to 
fear is fear itself". On this premise 
he developed a public works program 
which created jobs for millions of 
unemployed and loosened the fearful 
grip of the economic depression. 

WAS MASTER OF RADIO 

Roosevelt sponsored a vast program 
of social^ reforms — the National La- 
bor Relations Act recognizing the 
right of trade unions to collective 
bargaining; employment and old age 
insurance; regulation of financial 
operations, and he vigorously attacked 
monopolistic practices in industry. 
No administration ever achieved such 
monumental social reforms as those 
of the Roosevelt administrations. 
They won him the gratitude of the 
American common people and the 
bitter enmity of the social group of 
which he was a born member. 

These social milestones including 
repeal of the unpopular prohibition 
act Roosevelt aptly characterized as 
the "New Dear'. Roosevelt, the man, 
commanded loyalty and affection. A 
hard taskmaster to himself, he ha- 
bitually worked far into the night. 
He also had the gift of humor and 
relaxation. His charm and wit dom- 
inated world diplomatic conferences 
as well as personal relations. Roose- 
velt was the first president to make 



use of the radio for public expression 
and he possessed one of the most 
persuasive radio voices in the world. 
His "fireside chats," as he called 
them, frank discussions of vital topics 
with the people, became a cherished 
program of the American home. 
Many of the talks were memorable. 

Roosevelt was ever in the forefront 
of the war against the Axis powers. 
He flew thousands of miles over land 
and ocean to confer with other Allied 
leaders, Churchill and Stalin. These 
conferences took him to Cairo, Casa- 
blanca, Teheran and to Yalta on the 
Black Sea. And there the strokes 
were charted for the defeat of the 
aggressors and measures agreed upon 
for the permanent organization of a 
better world for free peoples every- 
where. \ 

TRIBUTE TO GI JOE 

Goodness is always a strong ingre- 
dient of true greatness. Roosevelt 
was both a good and a great man. It 
was fitting and proper that eight 
noncommissioned officers of the Uni- 
ted States Army, Navy, Marine 
Corps and Coast — "G.I. Joes" all 
should lift his coffin from the 
funeral train that arrived from Warm 
Springs. Franklin D. Roosevelt was 
a champion of the common man — the 
"G.I. Joe" of peacetime America.

Declares MacArthur, Nimitz, 
Others To Remainln Command 

Washington— President Harry S. Truman, in his first 
public address as chief executive of the United States, told a 
joint session of Congress yesterday that "both Germany and 
Japan can be certain, beyond any shadow of doubt, that America 
will continue the fight for freedom until no vestige of resistance 
remain." "Our demand/* he declared, "has been, and it remains — 
unconditional surrender." 

In a vigorous pledge that there will be no 
change in leadership among the fighting com- 
mands, Truman said: 

"The grand strategy of a United Nation*, 
war has been determined. We are now carry- 
ing out our part of the strategy under the able 
direction of General MacArthur, Admiral Nimitz, General Eisen- 
hower, General Arnold, General Marshall, Admiral Leahy, and 
Admiral King. "I want the entire world to know that this direc- 
tion must and will remain unchanged and unhampered. 

Truman promised an "unconditional surrender" of the enemy 
on firm but just peace terms. 

Pointing out the heavy price of victory, he said to "settle 
for merely another temporary respite would surely jeopardize 

A the future security of all the 
world." 

President Truman, speaking to b 
packed chamber, was given a ten 
minute ovation as he entered to de- 
liver his first address to Congress, 
Waves of applause a wept the House 
chamber when the former Missouri 
boy, who has become the nation's 
leader, spoke. Afterwards members 
of all political parties and faction? 
acclaimed his address. 

He entered the house at 1:02 p.m. 
walked with firm step to the speaker's 
desk, pausing to bhake hands with 
two representatives in wheel chairs 
along the aisles* 

The President's 20-minute speech 
was given in a clear, firm voice, with 
no attempt at oratory, 

The President declared that the 
Allies "will not traffic with the 
breakers of the peace on the terms 
of the peace," observing that the laws 
of God and man had been violated 
and that the guilty must not go un- 
punished, "even though we must 
pursue them to the ends of the earth," 
Lasting peace, he pointed out, was 
impossible if we permitted "dangerous 
opponents to plot future wars with 
impunity at any mountain retreat, 
however distant/' There was no 
safety behind geographical barriers 
he said and real security could be 
found only in law and justice. 

Truman, indicated a continuance of 
a realistic democracy for the Ameri- 
can people, "declaring that America 
had labored long and hard to achieve 
a social order worthy of its great 
heritage. 

He said tremendous progress had

THE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA 

One of the outstanding manifestations of Manila 9 s determination to pull 
itself out of the ashes of the destruction wrought by Japan is the reforma- 
tion of the Manila Symphony Orchestra* 

Music has always been close to tlte heart of the Filipinos, and the 
Manila Orchestra uxts probably the outstanding symphony orchestra of the 
Far East, Its rebirth is evidence — if evidence were needed — that the Jap* 
anese could destroy the physical aspect of Manila, but could do nothing 
to hurt the artistic soul of the city. 

When and where Dr. Zipper ivill be able to present his first symphony 
concert has not been announced. It is to be hoped that it will be soon, 
and it is certain that anywhere it may be put on in Manila will be %vtjkin 
view of destruction wrought by the Japs, 

Wfien the concert is put on, all the world will realize the failure of 
Japanese totalitarianism to destroy the good things of Occidental culture 
which have been part of the Philippine heritage from the West,

Food Procurement For Manila 
Stepped Up In EGA Program 

A comprehensive program of food procurement has been launched by 
the Emergency Control Administration to bring down prices of foodstuffs 
and insure a steady supply for city residents. 

EGA Executive Officer A, de Castro reported Monday that the EGA 
sent cut agents to the provinces to canvas sources of foodstuffs, including 
rice, fish and vegetables with a view to having them available to the gov- 

■ ^ernment 

Purchasing stations, according to 
Castro, have been established in 
Nueva Ecija and Tarlac and more arc 
to be opened in other areas where 
food supplies are abundant The 
stations in Cabanatuan and Panique, 
he said, have been buying rice and 
camotes for the city. 

Castro disclosed that about seven 
truckloads of earn ate are being 
brought daily to Manila by the EC A. 
These are being sold wholesale at P. 08 
per kilo to market vendors who were 
ordered to sell them to the public 
at the government price of JMO per

Lipa 

Secretary of Information and Ins- 
truction Maximo Kalaw, who returned 
last week from a visit to his farm 
in Lipa, Ba tan gas, said yesterday 
that a ravine where he used to play 
as a boy "is cluttered with the rot- 
ting bodies of about a thousand men 
massacred by the Japanese." 

He added that barely 30 persons 
are left of about 100 persons who 
formerly lived on his farm. Kalaw 
said that shortly after the Japanese 
learned that he was a member of 
President Osmena's group of officials 
in Leyte, they started hunting down 
those who had anything to do with 
him. Among those beheaded were his 
step -mother and a sister-in-law, the 
wife of Attorney Jose Kalaw, 

"The bodies in the ravine were 
those of male residents of Lipa and 
the neighboring barrios," Kalaw said. 
"The men were rounded up and kept 
in a seminary in the northern part 
of the town. Then in groups of ten 
and fifteen, they were taken to the 
ravine and bayoneted." Those left 
behind each time were told that the 
men being taken away were leaving 
the next town, Kalaw explained.

Defines Democracy 

New Yokk— Marshall Field, 
owner of two United States 
daily newspapers— P.M. in New 
York and the Chicago Sun— said 
in his newly-released book, 
"Freedom Is More Than a 
Word", that democracy is an 
"endless series of group, resolu- 
tions as indicated by group 
needs/' 

The book was a reaffirmation of 
Fields' faith in democracy as well 
as a plea for extension of its oppor- 
tunities and privileges, He found 
that results, by adhering to democracy 
over a period of years in the United 
States, have been good. 

Field listed elements of "that free- 
dom-cooperation balance we call 
democracy" as reasonable economJC 
security, peace, access to facts, and 
toughness of what he termed "skep- 
ticism of trade and ways of doing 
things." He characterized as parti- 
cularly helpful in the United States 
"certain tendencies in corporation 
law, in general social intelligence m 
the growth of small businesses, and 
in development of pressure group 
trade unions and consumer co-opera-

Field asserted the most insidious 
form of organization was the inter- 
national cartel which, in the long run 
actually "stifled employment, best 
utilization of natural resources and 
full development of diverse creative 
talents". He declared "free competi- 
tive enterprise should always have 
advantage over cartels in world 
trade. Field also stated that "eter-

during Japanese occupation and 
are still under repair. 

Eager customers, lured by 
incorrect reports of the bank 
opening to the Banco Hipoteca-

bluntly that the bank is not yet 
ready to do business.

Plans Made To Transform Camp O'Donnell 
Into National Shrine For P. I. War Dead 

Committee Is Named 
To Acquire Property 
Of Former Jap Prison 

Secretary of National Defense 
Tomas Cabili announced yester- 
day that he will appoint a com- 
mittee to arrange the transform- 
ation of Camp O'Donnell into 
the Arlington of the Philippines. 

Camp O'Donnell was the Japanese 
concentration camp for USAFFE 
prisoners. The Secretary who" visit- 
ed the camp's graveyard yesterday, 
was appalled by the neglected condi- 
tion of the place. 

"The crosses over the graves have 
disappeared, he said. Only mounds 
indicate where the men, who died of 
starvation and disease lie buried in 
communal graves." 

Secretary Cabili stated it shall be 
the duty of the committee to acquire 
title over the property and arrange 
for its conversion into a national 
cemetery An attempt will be made 
to identify the graves. 

' "Twenty-six thousands heroes," the 
Secretary recalled, "lie buried 
O'Donnell."

Is Planned At 150,000 Men 

Under present plans the Philippine Army will be composed 
of 150,000 men, Secretary Tomas Cabili of National Defense 
revealed in Malacanan yesterday. Of these, 50,000 will come from 
the USAFFE. The remaining 100,000 will be drawn from 
guerrilla ranks. 



Cabili revealed further "there will 
be places for 20,000 other guerrilas 
in the Provost Marshal General." 
Unarmed members of the guerrillas 
will be given jobs in a labor pool 
or special services of the Philippine 
Army. 

Secretary Cabili estimated that 
there are about 180,000 guerrillas in 
the Philippines distributed as follows : 
36,000 in Mindanao, 40,000 in the Vi- 
sayas and 120,000 to 150,000 in Luzon. 
"While there are fewer guerrilleros 
in the southern islands, including 
Mindanao, they are better organized 
and 75 to 80 percent of them are 
armed, Secretary Cabili said. 



Two More Fighting 
Ships Launced In U. S. 

Kearney, N. J. — Two more men of

informal get-acquainted party given

your Philippine music that intrigues 
me," Ross remarked as he hummed 
Ay Kalisud and Planting Rice after- 
wards. He warned against chang- 
ing the individualistic rythm of 
Philippine music.

From Pursuing 



Cenizaf 
Japs 



Josef ino Cenizal well-known figure 
in pre-war college and local movie 
circles played his most dramatic role 
on the stage of life recently when 
he fled from Cuenca, Batangas, in an 
inadequately fuelled car chased by 
seven Japanese armed with a tommy- 
gun, rifles and hand grenades. 

The Japanese had set a price of 
several thousand pesos was set on 
his head for writing a victory song 
revolving around the landing of the 
Americans in Luzon. 

Cenizal's car stalled enroute to

Within Sight Of Berlin 



On Great Assault 

London— Soviet troops are 
fighting within sight of burning 
Berlin, Red Army dispatches 
from the Oder River front 
declared yesterday, without offi- 
cial confirmation. 

Other dispatches told of Russian 
successes in Austria and Czechoslo- 



A dispatch to the official Russian 
lewspaper Red Star said Soviet divi- 
jions massed "near Berlin" carried 
janners which they intended on Sta- 
in's orders to nail to flag poles in 
Berlin. 

Eddy Gilmore, Associated Press 
correspondent relayed a quoted dis- 
patch which said a group of Russian 
commanders, on an unspecified sec- 
tor east of Berlin, viewed the German 
capital burning under the bombs of 
American and British air fleets. One 
Russian officer was quoted as say- 
ng: 

"There dancing on the horizon was 
■ed flames. There Berlin burns. We 
iee it with our naked eyes/' 

Officially, however, the Soviet 
rapreme command maintained securi- 
ty silence on the Berlin bound drive. 
)ne press message from Moscow said 
he Soviet capital was humming with 
umors of impending big events. 

Last night's Russian communique 
nentioned only fighting in southeast- 
srn Germany, Austria and Czechoslo- 
vakia, and listed another 8,000 Ger- 
nans captured in mopping up opera- 
ions in East Prussia.

MINDANAO DRIVE SPEEDS 



Ernie Pyle, Famed Correspondent, 
Is Killed By Gunfire Off Okinawa 

Washington— Ernie Pyle, famous war correspondent 
beloved of American doughboys and generals alike, was 
Killed instantly Wednesday by a surprise burst of Japanese 
machmegun fire while watching action on tiny Ie Jima, off 
the west coast of Okinawa. 

His death was announced by Secretary of Navy James 
Forrestal in Washington yesterday. In his message, 
Forrestal paid tribute to the small, grey-haired reporter 
whose stories of this war "endeared him to men in all forces 
throughout the world." 

"At the time of his death/' Forrestal added, "he was 
with foot soldiers, the men for whom he had the greatest 
admiration. 

President Truman, in his tribute to the 44-year-old 
Scripps-Howard newsman who covered the war in Europe 
before going to the Pacific early this year, said: "No man 
in this war has so well told the story of the American fight- 
ing man as the American fighting man wanted it told." 



US. 3rd. ArmyTanks Cross Czech 
Frontier, Cutting Reich In Two 

Paris — American 3rd Army tanks and infantry, driving 
across the waist of Germany, slashed into Czechoslovakia yester- 
day, while other U. S. troops conquered the Elbe River strong- 
hold of Magdeburg, drove almost to the heart of Leipzig, and 
fought to clear the Nazi shrine city of Nuernberg. 



The invasions of Czechoslovakia 
placed Third Army forces within 100 
miles of Prague and 70 miles of 
Pilsen. 

Capture of Magdeburg gave U. S. 
Ninth Army forces a firm grip on 
the Elbe Rver along an 80 mile 
stretch from Magdeburg north to Wit- 
tenburg. The Germans were fight- 
ing back heavily against elements of 
the Ninth which crossed the Elbe 
River at Darby, some 45 miles west

front, British Second Army tanks 
moved with in 18 mile sofjlamb^ 



• Gen. MacArthur Hails 
| Reopening Of Bank 

General MacArthur, in a state- 
ment issued yesterday on the re- 
opening of the insular treasury 
bank, expressed the greatest 
pleasure on restoration of bank- 
ing facilities in Manila. He has 
been active in rendering every 
possible assistance to accomplish 
this purpose, Manila banking of- 
ficials said. 



Marines Reach Northern Tip Of Okinawa 



Gda M— American Marines on embattled Okinawa 
aye reached the northern tip of the- island, after an 
"interrupted advance since their original landings two 
erday 8g °' Pacific fleet head( l uarters a nnounced yes " 
On the southern end of the island, however, Ameri- 
»" Army forces were still held up by stubborn Japanese 
Renders alonjr the mountain ridges four miles above 
be capital city of Naha. . „ aa 

Off the central west coast of Okinawa, Army as- 
i01t troopi had ensrnlfed nearly two-thirds of tiny i© 



Island including a four-strip airfield. In the three- 
day action, Army units killed 388 Japanese on Ie. Our 
losses were 15 killed and 73 wounded. 

Yesterday's Pacific Fleet communique also an- 
nounced total casualties since the battle of Okinawa 
opened at nearly 8,000 American soldiers, sailors, and 
Marines, including 1,482 killed. 

Heaviest losses were suffered by the Navy which 
lost 989 killed, and 2,220 wounded. The last official 
™nnt of Japanese casualties on Okinawa placed enemy 
dead and captured at well over 9,000. 



Mac Arthurs Troop 
Penetrate 22 Miles 
From Beachheads 

The 24th Division on Minda- 
nao, taking full advantage of 
the surprise landing reported in 
yesterday's communique, moved 
rapidly southward fifteen miles 
to capture Cotabato and Tamon- 
taka controlling the north and 
south branches of the Mindanao 
River. 

This movement, made with heavy 
air support, was quickly consolidated 
and followed by a 22-mile drive in- 
land along both forks of the river to 
he road junction of Lomopog, today's 
ommunique from Gen. MacArthur's 
eadquarters said. The northern 
eachhead at Malabang is already be- 
ng expanded, with the airfield in 
operation by American forces. 

On Luzon, American forces repuls- 
ed a Japanese counterattack on the 
highway northwest of Baguio, des- 
troying an enemy tank spearhead. 
The encirclement and destruction of 
solated enemy strongpoints around 
the city continued, with medium, at- 
tack and fighter bombers dropping 
300 tons of bombs and heavily straf- 
ing enemy positions in support of 
ground operations. 

Today's communique also announced 
the seizure of Balabac Island, south 
of Palawan, which brings General 
MacArthur's forces within 45 miles 
of the northern tip of Borneo. 

Reduction of Japanese air bases 
and railroad installations on Formo- 
sa continued as bombers and fighters 
dropped 257 tons of bombs, destroy- 
ing many planes on the ground, and 
starting large fires and explosions on 
airfields and in railroad yards. Other 
planes harassed enemy shipping at 
Keelung harbor and in the Pescado- 
res Islands. 

In the air blockade of the China 
coast, reconnaissance bombers sank a 
Japanese transport loaded with 
troops, wrecked two coastal vessels 
and swept rail lines along the Indo 
China Coast, destroying rolling stock 
and other equipment. 

Heavy bombers hit the large oil 
installations at Tarakan on the north- 
east coast of Borneo, wrecking 
storage tanks. General MacArthur 
said the enemy's oil supply from this 
area has now "ceased." 

Other American and Allied planes 
hammered Japanese coastal positions, 
shipping, and troop supply areas 
from the Netherlands Indies, through 
New Guinea, to the Rabaul and

THE NEW MINDANAO LANDING 

The landing of American troops west' of Davao j 'allows the well-esta- 
blished Mac Arthur pattern of massing his military force at one point* 
achieving surprize by carefully planned strategy, then destroying the enemy 
in detail* 

Only one American division, the 2&th, was identified in the landing west 
of Davao City, General Mac Arthur es imatcd that the Japanese have three 
divisions of infantry and one mixed division of naval, marine and garrison 
forces on Mindanao, Nevertheless the Americans went ashore and soon 
secured a 35-mile beachhead, 

Ths rapid mopping tip of *he Philippines indicates that it won't be long 
before every Japanese force of any size in the islands has been dissipated 
and rendered militarily impotent. Then will come the time for the final 
assault on the enemy's homeland.

Although fighter opposition was 
nil, these missions are one of the 
most gruellin- fighter operations 
possible. Cramped into tiny cock-

the moment of take off until they 
are back on Land six or seven hours 
later. 

A few seconds too long over the 
target or in a dogfight, and the 
pilot may not have sufficient gas 
to get back. Almost every second 
of the 1500 mile trip is over water. 



Kalaw Reaffirms Ouster Stand

stL^ Secretary of Public Instruction Maximo Kalaw 

JraiLH? t0 J letter 0f Dr ' Arturo Tolentino, special- 
Piosecutoi m the summary court created daring Laurel's regime 

Kalaw wrote: "Your letter was* 

oasea on the supposition that collabo- anese. "Laurel's own town was razed 
ration was a matter of self-preserva- 
tion for our people, that annihilation 
of our people was the possible con- 
sequence of non^cooperation." 

In answer, Kalaw stated the offer of 
our leaders to cooperate made matters 
worse, "for the Japanese must have 
concluded that we were convinced of 
their 'noble 1 war motive or were at 
least willing to submit to them." 

"As a consequence," wrote Kalaw, 
"the Japanese had a right to expect 
strict obedience to and compliance 
with their wishes and they did not 
have t to pursue their policies of at- 
traction, I noticed that in the places 
where there was a more organized 
guerrilla resistance, the Japanese 
were more tolerant and sought to 
attract the Japanese population." 

Kalaw pointed out that the province 
of Laurel, Recto and Alas — Batangas 
was severely punished by the Jap- 



to the ground and his own home re- 
duced to ashes," he said. 

Regarding the status of civil serv- 
ice employees, Kalaw presented the 
following considerations: "When the 
civil service employees of the Com- 
monwealth took the oath of alleigiance 
to the puppet republic, a government 
antagonistic to the Commonwealth 
not only in its organization but in its 
aims and principles, those employees 
violated that prime qualification of 
loyalty and lost all merits they had 
they had to hold or retain a position." 

DEPOSIT BOXES FOUND INTACT 

The safe deposit boxes of the

20 Percent Rate 
Of Tuberculosis 
Found In Check 

Six thousand seven hundred Ma- 
nila residents were diagnosed for tu- 
berculosis at the San Lazaro hospital 
last month and about 1,300 or 20 per- 
cent of them were found to be suf- 
fering from the disease in its advanced 
stage, according to Dr. Cesar Ongpin, 
senior tuberculosis specialist at San 
Lazaro. 

Dr. Ongpin stated the majority of 
the T.B. sufferers came from eva- 
cuation centers where they had suf- 
fered from acute malnutrition and 
complete lack of medical treatment 
for months. 

Plans are now under way to ex- 
pand the T.B, ward at San' Lazaro, 
Dr, Ongpin added* T.B, dispensaries 
may be established in various sections 
of the city in the near future in order 
to enable patients in distant districts 
to report for immediate treatment. 
The establishment of such clinics will 
relieve congestion in San Lazaro.

Smaller Models 
To Be Dropped, 
Rix Corps Says 

Washington— tL S. Army 
Air Forces headquarters an- 
nounced last night decreases in 
aircraft production of lighter 
models to allow for concentra- 
tion of Super Portress bombers 
in the coming all-out offensive 
against Japan. 

There will be no immediate discon- 
tinuance of aircraft production in 
any plants, but a tapering off pro- 
cess will be followed over several 
months, the statement said, Changed 
strategical and tactical requirements 
were set forth as cause for a 15 per- 
cent overall reduction measured in 
airplane weight. * 

This will enable concentration on 
production of B-29 and B-32 super 
bombers for use in the offensive on 
the Japanese homeland. 

"Larger and more complex models 
will require untiring effort of man- 
agement and labor to meet future 
production schedules, "the official an- 
nouncement added. 

Meanwhile, Washington announced 
two Super Forts were missing from 
the two day series of attacks Tues- 
day and Wednesday on six airfields 
on Kyushu island in the Jap home- 
land. There was little fighter oppo- 
sition except over one airfield, but 
"considerable" anti-aircraft fire was 
encountered, a communique said. 

The two-day smash at airfields 
represented a significant departure in 
the pattern of B-29 operations against 
Japan, which previously were concen- 
trated on strategical objectives like 
factories and arsenals. 

Plans Laid To Rebuild 
P. I. Chemical Industry 

To rehabilitate and rebuild chemi- 
cal process industries already exist- 
ing before the war, representatives 
ot chemical and allied industries in 
the Philippines met last Saturday 
afternoon under the sponsorship of 
the American Chamber of Commerce 
and organized a committee on chemi- 
cal and allied industries. 

This is the fourth committee al- 
ready organized, President Samuel F. 
Caches stated, three other committees 
on banking, transportation and min- 
ing industries having been act up 
previously.

London— Since April 1, the Allied air offensive has destroy-

Virtually Ended' 
Jays MacArthur 

American amphibious forces, 
in a surprise envelopment man- 
euver which outflanked the 
Japanese garrison on Cebu, 
killed 5,000 enemy troops and 
scattered the remnants into the 
hills, virtually writing an of- 
ficial finish to the campaign to 
liberate the Visayas, General 
MacArthur announced today. 

Proclaiming that "our forces now 
control the entire Visayan group," he 
declared more than 6,400,000 Pilipi- 
pinos, living in an area 33,000 square 
miles, have been liberated on Leyte, 
Samar, Mindoro, Panay, Palawan, 
Cebu, Negros, Bohol, Masabate and a 
score of lesser islands. 
• "This sweeps clear," he said, "the 
center of the Philippines and leaves 
the only remaining enemy organized 
resistance in Mindanao on the south 
and upper Luzon on the north." 

He emphasized that many food- 
stuffs and raw materials for recons- 
truction of the Philippines, and for 
presecuting the war against Japan 
would be available now from the 
Visayas, in addition to air, land, and 
aaval bases for attacks on Japanese 
positions in the East Indies and 
southeastern Asia. 

No exact figures were given, but 
today's communique said that Ameri- 
can casualties were "extraordinarily 
tent" for the victorious Visayan

Americans Capture 
Leipzig And Halle 

Paris — American First Army troops 
scored a double victory yesterday, 
overcoming all opposition in the great 
industrial center of Leipzig and cap- 
turing Halle, 15 miles to the north, 
Allied headquarters reported last 
night. 

Leipzig, a city of 1,000,000 popula- 
tion, and Halle, fell only a few hours 
apart. 

In southern Germany, American 
Seventh Army troops cleared the 
greater part of Nuernberg, capturing 
a large bag of German prisoners in- 
cluding three generals. West of Ber- 
lin, Ninth Army columns battled a 
fierce German counter-attack between 
captured Magdeburg and Brunswick, 
while British tanks rolled within 10 
miles of Hamburg. 



MOSCOW — Powerful Russian armies were storming Berlin's 
approaches on a broad front, the Soviet High Command an- 
nounced officially last night for the first time. 

Red Army troops spanned both the Oder and Neisse Rivers 
east and southeast of the German capital. Last night's brief 
communique did not reveal the depth of the Soviet penetrations, 
but disclosed that fighting had raged for three days for "capture 
and widening" of bridgeheads. 

Along the Neisse, three towns 38 

to 72 miles southeast of Berlin were 

overrun in the new drive. 

German broadcasts placed Rus- 
sian spearheads even closer. One 
commentator admitted that Red 
Army columns captured two strong, 
points east of the capital, and 
smashed on within 14 miles of 
Berlin. 

Paris Radio, in another unconfirm- 
ed report, broadcast yesterday that 
Russian artillery already was shell- 
ing Berlin. 

Earlier, Moscow revealed that Rus- 
sian troops driving west of Vienna 
had moved closer to Linz and Munich 
and punched more holes into the 
central Nazi defense line in Austria. 
In Czechoslovakia, other Red Armies 
made substantial advances toward the 
industrial center and arsenal of Brno. 
Entry into Brno was reported im- 
minent. 



Us Will Do Duty By Hitler 

Washington— Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, asked at 
esterday's press conference what American soldiers have been 
istructed to do if they found Hitler, remarked : . 
, "You may be sure American troops will do their full duty if 

^ circumstances arise." „ tJi1 .„ ^ 

Stimson added that "unless he resists" Hitler will be taken

Calcutta — British 14th Army 
forces encircled and captured the im- 
portant Burmese oil field town of 
Chauk on the east bank of the Irra- 
waddy, Allied headquarters stated 
yesterday. 

Singu to the north and a key river 
point to the south also were taken, 
while "good progress" was made be-

Advance Preceded 
By One Of Heaviest 
Barrages Of War 

Guam — Preceded by one of the 
heaviest barrages of the Pacific war, 
American assault troops opened a 
powerful new offensive yesterday 
along the entire southern Okinawa 
front, Pacific Fleet headquarters an- 
nounced yesterday. 

Concentrations of Army and Ma- 
rine land-based artillery joined with 
swarms of carrier planes, battleships, 
cruisers, and light units to smash at 
the Japanese mountain line four 
miles above the capital of Nana. 

Under this barrage, 27th, 7th and 
96th Infantry Divisions swung to the 
offensive between 6 and 8 a.m., and 
by noon, the left and right flanks of 
the American lines moved forward 
from 500 to 800 yards, overrunning 
the village of Machinato. Japanese 
defenders were resisting stubbornly 
with artillery, mortars, and light 
weapons, which failed however, to 
halt our advance. 

Army Mustangs, based on the new 
Iwo Jima airfields, made another 
attack on the Japanese homeland 
yesterday striking at the Atsugi air- 
field in the Tokyo area and shipping 
south of the Japanese capital. 

They destroyed or damaged 84 
Japanese planes, including 21 shot 
down in cornbat, crippled a large 
cargo ship, and set fire to another. 
They met no fighter opposition.

A MAP OF THE FUTURE 

Hanging on the wall of a room on the second floor of Malacanan Palace 
is a map with the bumed-out portions of Manila splashed in f$$» m Across 
the room is another map showing Manila as the city planners hope it will be 
reconstructed. 

On the second map there are definite districts for heavy industry > 
for light industry, for commercial and residential section and r best of all, for 
large parks. There are broad boulevards t allowing rapid transportation 
from one end of the city to oth&r t and special roadways for truck traffic. 

To change the map of a Greater Manila into reality will be difficult. 
Property owners wilt be forced to yield land they consider invaluable. 
Houses will have to be moved f and business enterprises will be restricted. 
But a finer city for everyone to live will emerge. 

The challenge of making Manila into the finest city in the Orient should 
appeal to every resident,

_jed Mains, Esteros Pose 
Flood Danger in Rainy Season 

In the next few months Manila will be faced with serious 
flood conditions, warned Louis P. Croft of the City Planning 
Office yesterday. The river is silted and clogged with debris 
and the esteros are overgrown with water-hyacinths (water- 
lilies), he said. The esteros have not been cleaned for several 



years. 

The debris of the city has clogged 
surface drainage, storm e ewers have 
bocn cither broken or so damaged and 
clogged as to no longer function effi- 
ciently, according to Croft, 

The only permanent solution for 
the problem is to fill the low areas of 
the city in many places as much as 
& meter. Croft said, The debris of 
the city should be used to raise the 
low places of the city. Drainage 
would be later augmented by the 
dredging of the north harbor and the 
river. 

The raising of the city would facil- 
itate the flow of sanitation sewage 
which has been an expensive and 
serious problem of Manila in the 
past. Temporary open drainage chan- 
nels in the center of proposed streets 
leading to the bay and the river would 
alleviate the imminent flood problem. 
These can later be replaced with con- 
crete tiled storm sewers. 



New USO Show To Tour 
Manila Area For Month 

"Music Lane," first of many USO 
shows to play at Army camps on 
Luzon, will continue its tour in the 
Manila area for about a month. The 
concert show features Althea Almon- 
da f violinist; Freda Draper, con- 
tralto; Lucy Kelston, soprano; Wal- 
ter Stafford, baritone and Marian 
Kalayjian, pianist. 

According to Ma.i\ Parker S. Kim- 
ball, Phibsec special service officer, 
an effort is being made to develop 
talent from army ranks through ques- 
tionnaires which have been distri- 
buted. — — ■ . 

NEW CLASSES PLANNED 

The Centro Escolar University, for 
the first time will open a high school 
department for boys. The regular 
first semester work from the first to 
the fourth year will commence on 
April 23rd and end on July 10th + 
Second semester work will begin im- 
mediately after. Sessions will be held 
in the afternoon beginning at 1:30. 



Ration Rackets 
Cost Manilans 
Goods for 100,000 

Kation racketeers have been obtain- 
ing enough extra commodities to 
supply 100,000 more persons than are 
actually served in the Manila area. 
Doubling up in rations was disclosed 
in the recent PCAU census, and 
PCAU 20 has taken steps to plug the 
loopholes revealed in the house-to- 
house canvass. 

It has established a card system 
and central issuing agency to prevent 
duplicate registration. In the past 
according to Vicente F. Barrano of 
the marketing division of PCAU 20, 
unscrupulous persons have registered 
at relief distribution centers for free 
rations while having the privilege of 
buying at community stores. He also 
said that there were eases where a 
family purchased from more than 
one store. 

In disclosing these unfair practices 
Barrano charged that the fault for 
any inequitable distribution of conv 
modities l ies largely with the public.

Nueva Ecija Heads 
Call For Repair 
Of Water System 

The municipal mayors of Nueva 
Ecija, greatest rice producing pro- 
vince of the Philippines, have ^peti- 
tioned the Department of Public 
Works and Communication to order 
tlie immediate repair and operation of 
the Penaranda, Talavera and KizaJ 
River irrigation systems of the pro- 
vince. .■ . 

They also petitioned Secretary of 
the Interior Tomas Confesor, to raise 
the price of palay to FIB "unless the 
government can furnish the people 
of this province commodities such as 
clothing, sugar, oil, soap, etc., at pre- 
war price levels." 

The Tatter request would set aside 
the presidential proclamation which 
fixed the price of palay at P3 a cavan. 

The mayors declare that successful 
production of palay requires an ade- 
quate supply of water from the irri- 
gation systems. Preparation of seed 
beds have been delayed due to Jack 
of rain and water from irrigation 
systems damaged by the war.

Manila pickpockets are on the

most cases American soldiers are 
the victims of the thieves. 

The police find it difficult — 
and sometimes impossible — to

soldiers, especially those who 
have Just arrived in Manila, can- 
not tell police in what particular

Swift House Passage Of Filipino 
Measure Follows RomuIo*s Address 

WASHINGTON — Unanimous passage in the House Wednesday 
of a bill granting Filipinos the right to become American citizens 
is the best measure of congressional reaction to Brig. Gen. Carlos 
P. Romulo's address earlier in the day on the price the Filipino 
people paid in defense of their American ideal.

Advance Within 
8 Miles' Of Key 
City Of Bologna 

Rome — American Fifth Army 
troops, cracking the outer de- 
fenses of Bologna, drove within 
eight miles of the great Italian 
industrial city yesterday, after 
seizing the key heights of Mont 
Adone and Monte Rumici in a 
bitter 60-hour battle. 

To the northeast, British Eighth 
Army troops knifed through positions 
on the road to Ferrera, stormed 
through the Argenta Gap, and cap- 
tured the Po Valley town of Bocca- 
eone, key to the German's "Genghis 
Eahn" line. Boecaleone is 15 miles 
siouUi oi Ferrera, and about 18 miles 
;outh of the Po River, 

The American advance appeared to 
have loosened German defenses be- 
Fore Bologna, frontline dispatches 
aid. It £ave them possession of a 
down-hill road to the Po Valley gate- 

iy city. Fifth Army troops also 
seized a road village within 8 miles 
f Bolrigna, 

For the first time in six months, 
r he Germans were deprived of heights 
which enabled them to pour down 
leadl> fire on Amereian positions. 
Two hundred Germans-a high figure 
for this mountainous sector- were cap- 
tured in the actions below Bologna, 
Along the Florence-Bologna main 
toad Allied troops were running into 
some of the heaviest fighting of the 
Italian campaign.

0§menaTalk§ With Trail 
Independence Not Discus 

Washington— Philippines President Sergio Osmefia visited ?u , 
the White House yesterday to confer with President Truman, j 
declaring- that he had "simply come to pay his respeets" to the j Medal Ut no 



new chief executive of the United States. 

Speaking to correspondents later, President Osmena said 
he had expressed his deep sympathy to President Truman on the 
death of President Roosevelt and the great shock it was to the 

people of the Philippines. 

Asked whether he had discussed 



Filipino independence with the preai 
lent, Osmena said: 

"This was just a preliminary con- 
ference to be followed by others. We 
did not discuss independence at this 
meeting." 

Asked if he felt that previous com- 
mittments made by President Roose- 
velt will be followed through, Osmena 
said "this subject was not discussed. 
I feel confident that what President 
Truman said about relations in gen- 
eral will be applied to the Philippines." 

Also present at tbe White House 
conference were Secretary of State 
Stettinius, Secretary of War Stimson, 
Secretary of Interior Ickes, and Sec- 
retary of Navy Forrestal. 

Osmena said he would remain in 
Washington "for several daya to see 
the president again."

VAZIS SAY REDS IN CAP1T 



LONDON — Russian Armies, in an 
xplosive climax to the Battle of Ger- 
iany, have broken into greater Berlin, 
he Berlin radio reported today. 

The announcement from the official 
German radio admitted "the enemy 
as reached Berlin proper." 

Earlier today, the regular Soviet 
ommunique issued in Moscow ah- 
ounced that Russian troops were 
ighting in the suburbs of Berlin. 

Marshal Zhukov's forces, numbering 
jerhaps three and a half million men, 
;eized the town of Erkner, a half mile

from the southeastern edge of the 
German capital, and pre-ssed close 
against the city along an arc to the 
northeast, the latest Soviet communi- 
que said. 

Moscow dispatches, describing the 
great Russian drive, said "there are no 
spearheads here — just one tremen- 
duous wall of Stalin and Sherman tanks. 

"The whole Brandenburg battlefield 
northeast, east, and southeast of Ber- 
lin is ablaze with tank fire, and a heavy 
barrage is being laid down by German 
massed artillery, and hundreds of self- 



4ST 




propelled weapons and anti- 
tank weapons. 

"The Germans have been 
hurled back from most of their 
trenches, but their lines are sup- 
ported by a wealth of light field 
pieces and machine guns strung 
out almost continously in a great 
arc around the capital." 

Russian pilots, returning from 
the great battle arena, reported

GO EASY ON THE WATER 

Ever since the Carriedo fund, established during Spanish times, grew 
to sufficient proportions to allow the construction of the first Manila 
reservoir in Sun Juan, this city has enjoyed one of the finest water systems 
in the Far East. 

On some occasions the supply was inadequate. Until 1929, when the 
huge reservoirs at Ipo could draw on the Angat water shed, Manila ex- 
perienced a water shortage nearly every hoi season* 

But previous shortages can't be compared to the one now facing Manila, 
American army engineers have done an amazing job of restoring the San 
Juan reservoir and Balara filters so t/iat the entire northern portion and 
much of the southern part of Manila have been able to get regular water 
service. 

But no one can put water into dry reservoirs. And until the Angat 
water shed can again be drawn on, the San Juan reservoir will have a ten- 
dency to run dangerously dry, 

It is, therefore, up to everyone to make the existing supply of water 
Stretch as far as possible. Unless all except absolutely essential water re- 
quiremmits are ignored, the city may be entirely without water during May, 
the hottest month of the year* 

If Manila has no regular water supply next month, epidemics of con- 
tagious diseases may sweep the city, leaving many deaths in their wake, 
'The entire task of reconstruction will be slowed down* People won't have 
wnicr to drink, let alone to bathe in. 

This is no time for half-way measures* Every leaky tap must be re- 
paired, every bit of water ?iow being wasted must be conserved, it's a job 
for the entire community, and if it is not done everyone will suffer. 



Labor Men Laud 
Troops Fighting 
In Northern Luzon 

On NoBTHEftN Luzon Front— 
Three American Pacific coast labor 
leaders yesterday praised infantry 
men^ of the 32nd Division after spend- 
ing a night in fox holes in the Cara- 
□alio Mountains under heavy artillery 
and mortar fire, . 1 

"No one really can appreciate wnat 
it is like until they've seen these 
men in action," said Mervyn Kath- 
bone, San Francisco, secretary of the 
California C.LO, Council. '-The job 
these men are doing under unbeliev- 
ably bad conditions is the most mag- 
nificent thing Fve ever seen." 

Similar sentiments were expressed 
by Claude Ballard, Portland, Oregon, 
president of the C.I.O. International 
Woodworkers of America and Thomas 
A. Rostell, San Francisco, assistant 
secretary of the Bay City Trades 
Council, A.F.L. The three are among 
ten labor leaders touring- war zones 
under the sponsorship of the War and 
Navy departments. 

The 32nd Division claims its mark 
of 600 days in active combat is a 
record for troops in this war. The 
division completed three years yes- 
terday.

nant, his water service will be cut off. 



146,760 CIVILIAN CASUALTIES 

LondqiN — Home Secretary Herbert

Friday that 146,760 civilians have 
been killed or injured in the United 
Kingdom by enemy action since the 
start of the war.

xas, who managed to escape to the 
American lines, puppet officials still 
continue to be captured by our forces. 

The latest to reach the division's 
lines are; Dionicio de Leon, military

Brig. Gen. Eoxas, who served under 
Gen. MacArthur at Bataan and Cor- 
regidor escaped into the American 
lines wtih his family after three days 
of hardships on mountain trails. 
They had their first meal at the 
Division headquarters mess after be- 
ing greeted by Maj. Gen. p, y? m 
Clarkson, division commander.

scaped Lepers Urged to Return for Treatment 



)irector of Health Jose Guidote 
pealed yesterday to the many 
ers who escaped from government 
rosariums during the Japanese oc- 
>ation and are now scattered 
■oughout the Philippines to return 
treatment as the government can 
*r provide food and comfort. 
3r. Guidote pointed out that the 
ers escaped during the** Japanese 
rime because they were given very 
;le food. More than 400 lepers fled ; 



from San Lazaro Hospital alone dur- 
ing the past year. In the same period, 
239 patients died, mainly of malnu- 
trition. 

The greatest number of escaped 
lepers was recorded in January, 1944 
when 184 left tne hospital. During 
February when Manila was liberated 
not a single leper escaped. The death 
rate was as high as two a day during 
the last days of December as the food 
problem became very acute. 



A hospital official said during the 
last year of Japanese occupation, 
lepers received about a handful of rice 
and about an ounce of fish as a 
meal. 

The problem of feeding lepers in 
the Culion colony became so great as 
early as 1942 that patients were al- 
lowed to go to, other leprosariums 
near their homes so that they could 
be fed by relatives. 



GFsPoseas MP*s 
To Secure Liquor 

The office of the Prorost 
Marshal lias received several 
complaints about American en- 
listed men impersonating mem- 
bers of the military police. 
With fake armbands, they en- 
tered bars, confiscated liquor 
and issued forced receipts. 

According to an investigator 
of the Provost Marshal's office 
two soldiers were caught re- 
cently after they had taken a 
considerable amount of liquor 
and money from a city store 
swner. Another G.I. who posed 
as a military police took money 
from a bar proprietor but was 
:aught sbortly after. \

Delgado, who was living in Manila 
during the Japanese occupation, said 
of the American troops: "Busy as 
they were with hard fighting, they 
took time to really help us. Even 
though they were traveling on ra- 
tions soldiers gave us many of their 
food packages-. Their medical corps- 
men and doctors saved the lives of 
many civilians." 

Delgado added economic conditions 
in the Philippines were very serious 
but the U. S. Army is providing food, 
and clothing for the destitute. He 
pointed out this year's rice crop will 
be far below normal, as the Japanese 
had taken about half tne production, 
another quarter had been looted and 
much of the remainder was of poor 
quality. He said that fishing could 
not be relied upon as a source of food 
because the Japanese had comman- 
deered most of the boats and nets 
"Our people are largely dependent 
upon what the Americans can supply, 
Delgado said. "It will take long 
months to get new crops and raise 
livestock."

Anderson Wins 
Colonelcy and Post 
With Sixth Army 

Maj. Bernard L. Anderson, Luzon 
guerrilla leader and coordinator, has 
been promoted to lieutenant colonel 
in regular service with the Sixth 
Army. 

After the fall of Bataan, Anderson, 
then a captain in the USAFFE air 
corps, escaped the death march to 
Capaz and took to the mountains of 
Zambales. Later he went to Bulacan, 
and in Biak-na-Bato he formed his 
first guerrilla group. The Japanese 
raided his hideout, killing many of 
his men. But Anderson slipped away 
and moved to Sierra Madre. 

Using a patched-up radio trans- 
mitter, Anderson contacted the head- 
quarters of General MacArthur in 
Australia. Then American sub- 
marines began to bring supplies, arms 
and ammunitions to the guerrillas in 
Luzon. These arms were used by the 
guerrillas in harassing Jap garrisons 
before the return of the Americans. 

In a resolution last March, the 
various sectors and units of Anderson 
Guerrillas offered General Mac- 
Arthur 10,000 men to fight side by 
side with the Americans in the in- 
vasion of Japan. 

Anderson's Tampa and Blue Eagle 
Sectors are preparing a reception in 
honor of their chief when he conies to 
Manila this week.

"Cooperatives," he declared, "are 
the nearest approach to the real aim 
of economics — the greatest good for 
the greatest number.

BULLETIN 
MOSCOW— The Soviet mid- 
night communique announced 
today Russian troops had smashed 
into Berlin capturing 14 suburbs 
inside the city. No other details 
were immediately available. 

Earlier reports from Moscow revealed that the Ger- 
man capital was hemmed in by Russian steel on three 
sides. The German radio announced that Russian tanks, 
which yesterday entered Berlin proper in Weisensee and 
Panlcow districts on the northeast side, had broken into 
Glienicke, the northwestern suburbs, eight miles from 
the heart of the city. 

Red Army penetration of this industrial district rep- 
resented a 12 mile advance from Bernau, and left only 
a 30 mile gap to be closed around Berlin. 

Fighting also surged along the Landseberger 
Strasse to the southeast which leads into Berlin's center.

EDITORIAL 



HITLER GOES UNDERGROUND 

Adolf Hitler has admitted the , many remains to be seen 



defeat of the German armies 
and has ordered the German 
people to adopt guerilla war- 
fare tactics. This confirms our 
editorial statement in yester- 
day's extra that the Battle for 
Germany has come to a strategic 
close and that the war in Europe 
may be regarded as at an end. 
Just as th<* Battle for Philip- 
pines was strategically ended 
with the capture of Manila so 
the Battle for Germany comes 
to a strategic close with the oc- 
cupation of Berlin, Hitler's ad* 
mission that his armies are 
whipped, and his order to the 
Nazis to go underground, is the 
only logical sequence to the loss 
of Berlin. 

How serious the guerrilla 
movement vyiil become in Ger- 

BlTLEE— Continued from Page 1 

to organized German resistance in Europe. But it fol 
owed frequent warnings by General Eisenhower that 
there would probably be no formal surrender of German 
armies— only piecemeal destruction of disorganized Narl 
remnants. * 

German hopes for a "death stand" in southern Ger 
many were dealt a serious blow today when U. S. Seventh 
Army troops seized a bridge across the Danube intact 
at Dillingen, northwes't of the Nazi party's birthplace citv 
ot Munich. ' 
Meanwhile, "Russian armies were reported within lis to 28 



It 

is true, of course, that the Ger- 
mans can be as tough as the 
Norwegians, as adroit as the 
French, as stubborn as the Bri- 
tish, in the matter of resistance. 
Cut the guerrillas in occupied 
Europe were sustained by the 
knowledge that help was coming. 
The German know that there is 
no source they can call on out- 
side their own borders. 

The end of organized resist- 
ance in Germany means that the 
Japanese now stand alone. Of 
all the aggressors, they alone 
continue in their futile dream of 
world conquest. But their doom 
is certain. The ever-increasing 
stream of supplies made avail- 
able from the European theater 
will destroy Japanese militarism 
even sooner than had been ex- 
pected.

American troops in the Philippines have killed 10,896 Jap 
mese and taken 353 prisoners since April 16, General MacArthur 
revealed today. This brought the grand total of Japanese losses 
in the Philippines since the Leyte landings to 324,715. 

At the same time, today's communique said our losses since 
April 16 were 584 killed in acti on, 3 missing, and 2168 wounded. 

American bombers and fighters^ 
lontiiraed to support ground opera- 
tions on all ground sectors on Luzon, 
dropping 372 tons in their latest 
strikes. 

Meanwhile, the newly-opened 
American offensive to clear Minda- 
nao gathered new momentum. On 
Sunday, 24th Division troops advanc- 
ed 30 miles and seized the road junc- 
tion at Kabacan serving the only 
north and south line of land commu- 
nications between Davao and North 
Mindanao. 

The enemy's forces on Mindanao 
"are now split in two, with northern 
garrisons isolated from those in the 
south," General MacArthur said. 

Medium and attack bombers close- 
'y supported the Mindanao drive. 

On Formosa, American planes

Germany were storming

)oulevards yesterday and 
smashing through strongly 
Jefended barricades and

Von Papen Tries To Effect Peace 

Pakis — Franz Von Papen, German ambassador to 
Turkey, allowed himself to be captured by American troops 
in the false hope of finding employment by the Allies as a 
peace negotiator, Lieut. General Walter B. Smith, Allied 
chief of staff in western Europe, announced Saturday. 

Smith said there was absolutely no indication that the 
enemy had empowered Von Papen to carry out negotiations, 
adding that the Allies had no intention of justifying Von 
Panen's hope. It was also disclosed that American, British 
and Soviet officials had trusted Von Papen after he was 
taken into custody in the Ruhr.

Hies Hand Germans Task 
f Feeding Liberated Slaves 

Jermany— The German people, paying the price of defeat, will be made to feed and house 
millions of liberated slaves— Russians, Yugoslavs, Poles, Bulgarians, Italians, and all the 
even at the bitter cost of reducing their own food supplies to a minimum, according to a news

Dig!" And Prosperous Nazis 
Exhume Victims With Bare Hands 

Germany — "Healthy, prosperous Nazi party members 
exhumed with their bare hands hastily buried bodies of 500 
of their former prisoners— anti-Nazi Frenchmen, Belgians, 
Russians, Poles, and Dutchmen — who were burned to death 
and shot a few hours before the Americans arrived", an 
American correspondent wrote yesterday from the Gardele- 
gen concentration camp overrun by Gen. Omar Bradley's 
troops. After executions the bodies had been hurried 
dumped into makeshift graves. 

Gaedelegen citizens who arrived without shovels were 
told to "dig with their hands", and they began work under 
the eyes of American soldiers bearing rifles and tommy guns. 
When some protests were made against barehanded digging, 
the American captain pointed to the graves and said "Dig!" 

Each day, for 6 days, Americans have been rounding up 
groups of civilians and marching them 14 miles to the scene 
of the massacre for a silent sermon. Civilians who are now 
removing prisoners' bodies from their mass grave are carry- 
ing out the work under the order of a U. S. Army captain. 
He has instructed the mayor of the town "to have its 200 
civilians on hand for this purpose." 




Swiss Paper Declares That Germany 
Disgraces Self Before History 

Berne — "The German nation has disgraced itself before his- 
tory and before the world by tolerating shocking atrocities that 
come to light as the Allies drive across Germany," the neutral 
Swiss paper, Easier Nationalzeitun said yesterday, adding, "Shame 
brought upon Germany by the horrors committed under the Third 
Reich will stay with the German nation before history." 

The paper said in part : "How is it possible that there should 
still be people in Germany who are willing to sacrifice their lives 
for a system which has overand over again disgraced every shred 
of humanity? 
"What sort of nation is it, anyway, 



that cowardly consented to perpetra- 
tion of these horrors and even con- 
tributed brutal guards for camps 
and prisons in which men and women 
were tortured and worked to death 
without mercy?" 

The paper observed "the alibi of 
ignorance cannot be accepted from 
so-called 'decent Germans'," adding, 
"one must not forget that the masses 
in Germany, as well as leading busi- 
ness and professional men, must 
have had a pretty clear picture of 
what was going on in these camps 
because, otherwise, fear of a concen- 
tration camp couldn't have been an 
effective means of public terror. 

"Moreover, the paper pointed out, 
"many tens of thousands of small and 
big businessmen with war contracts 
have been exploiting foreign slave 
laborers in their plants. They must 
have had ample opportunity of wit- 
nessing cruelties and privations 
meted out bj Naii gro*rd« to these 



Agencies Advised 
To Set Up Budget 

The budget commission is rushing 
preparation of the budget for the 
period from October 23 when the 
Commonwealth government was re- 
established on Philippine soil to June 
30, it was learned at the finance de- 
partment yesterday. 

The various offices of the govern- 
ment have been advised to submit 
their plantilla as early as possible to 
enable the commission to complete the 
budget before end of the month. 

The budget is covered by executive 
order No. 30 of President Osmena 
which appropriated funds authorized 
by the Appropriation Act passed by 
the National Assembly in 1941 for 
the fiscal year 1942. These funds 
were not completely spent by the gov- 
ernment in 1942 due to Japanese 
occupation. 



Guerrilla Unit Now 
Part of 1st Cavalry 

The SMS Regiment of the Mar- 
king Fil-American Guerrillas was last 
week inducted into the First Cavalry 
Division, U. S. Army, with Col. 
Serafin M. Silvestre retaining com- 
mand of the unit. This regiment 
was originally a Manila unit but 
moved to the hills as soon as Manila 
and other points in the Philippines 
were subjected to air attacks in 
September, last. 

The SMS Regiment is credited with 
being the first guerrilla unit to raise 
the American flag on Laguna soil. 
They also helped in the liberation of 
the American internees at Los Banos. 



Manila Police Chief 
Post Still Vacant 

No appointment has yet been made 
of the successor of Col. M. E. Jones 
who was relieved last week of his 
duties as chief of police of Manila 
and made provost marshal of the 
Luzon area, the office of the provost 
marshal for Manila stated yesterday. 

In the absence of a chief of police, 
Capt. A. N. Tuazon, assistant chief 
of police, has been acting as head.

South Okini 



GUAM — American Marines 
have landed on two more islands 
off Okinawa while resistance on 
the main island itself is so fierce 
there are no changes in position, 
Pacific Fleet headquarters an- 
nounced yesterday. 

More than 11,000 Japanese were 
killed to date on the fighting front 
in southern Okinawa, above the cap- 
ital city of Naha, the communique 
added. In addition, Okinawa-based 
Army planes sank an 8,000 ton enemy 
vessel and destroyed 47 enemy planes 
in a far ranging strike over Nagoya 
on the Japanese mainland. 

The Japanese made another heavy 
attack on American task forces lying 
off Okinawa, sinking one light U. S. 
ship, but losing 110 more planes. 

A bitter battle raged in the south- 
ern Okinawa sector as 3 U.S. infantry 
divisions battled for every yard of 
irregular terrain. Thousands of tons 
of explosives were hurled into elabo- 
rate Jap defenses from naval guns, 
artillery and aircraft, including rocket 
firing planes. 

British Bombers 
Hammer German 
North Sea Ports 

London — Royal Air Force heavy 
bombers hit Bremen last night, strik- 
ing at German's second largest port 
less than 24 hours after RAF Mos- 
quitos hammered Kiel. 

These attacks followed strong at- 
tacks on German rail lines and 
highways in front of American Third 
Army troops punching into Czecho- 
slovakia. 

Allied headquarters announced a 
bombing line had been drawn in front 
of Russian lines to prevent accidental 
hits on Soviet columns, apparently 
ending the almost nightly attacks 
on Berlin.

Russian tanks which entered 
Berlin proper on the northeast 
side, had broken into the north- 
western suburbs, only eight 
miles from the heart of the city. 

The order signed by Hitler was 
captured by British Second Army 
troops below Hamburg. It admitted 
Germany's army had been shattered, 
and Allied superiority in N the west had 
ended any possibility of major mili- 
tary operations by the Germans. 

Hitler's o^der further called on 
Nazi troops to use guerrilla tactics 
"taught to us by the Russians," ac- 
cording to Allied headquarters. 

There was no amplication from Al- 
lied headquarters on the Hitler decree 
which virtually signalled the end of 
organized German resistance in 
Europe. 

German hopes for a "death stand" 
in southern Germany were dealt a 
serious blow yesterday when U. S. 
Seventh Army troops seized a bridge 
across the Danube intact, northwest 
of Munich. At the same time, French 
First Army tanks crashed into Stutt- 
gart, the most important industrial 
city in Southern Germany. 

The capture of Stuttgart trapped 
unestimated thousands of Germans in 
three pockets along a 100 mile stretch 
of the Swiss border between the 
Rhine and Lake Constance.

TIER FLEES TO FORT NEAR DENMARK, DUTCH SAY 



London — -Although the Nazi radio yesterday 
f Adolf Hitler and his propaganda chief 
>eU are remaining in Berlin to direct "from 
Vont line" the last battle for Germany, Stock- 
reports placed the Nazi government at Salz- 
!in the south, and the Free Dutch radio de- 



clared that Hitler had fled to northern defenses 
in Mecklenberg province near Denmark. 

Front dispatches, relaying an unconfirmed 
report, said Hitler and a number of high-ranking 
Nazis were hiding out in the cave-studded Harz 
mountains, and that U. S. 8th armored division 
reconnaissance crews were scouring the area* 



Stockholm dispatches t quoting German con- 
trolled Scandinavian Telegraph Bureau, laid 
Goebbels also had fled to Mecklenburg* 

An Associated Press dispatch from the Swiss 
frontier reported the wives of Gestapo Chief 
Himmler, Reichsmarshal Goering and Goebbels, 
fled in the direction of the Bavarian mountains.

Money is Sound, 
Mathay Declares 

"The Victory peso and the Philip- 
pine Treasury certificates unlike the 
Jap military notes are sound money," 
Ismael Mathay, Commissioner of the 
Budget declared in a radiocast yes- 
terday noon over the Commonwealth 
Hour. 

"Today's currency is backed up by 
100 per cent reserve in the form of 
dollar deposit in the United States 
Treasury/* he said. 

"In addition to this, the Philippines 
is fortunate that its Exchange Stan- 
dard Fund amounting to more than 
sixty million pesos was deposited in 
the U. S. Treasury and saved from 
the enemy."

B-29 Heads Marshal Forces 
For Unprecedented Assault 

With the 20th Airporce in the Marianas— Indicating the 
reinforced power soon to be hurled at Japan, a single bomber 
command — -the 21st— is set to strike Japan wi'h more destruction 
than the giant Eighth American Airforce in Europe rained at the 
Nazis, Associated Press aviation editor, James Strebig, said 
yesterday. 

"The combined striking power of 



both commands of the 20th Airforce 
this year may exceed in effective 
effort the entire output of Army air- 
forces in 1944," he added. 

Noting General H. H. Arnolds

dropped nearly 1,100,000 tons of 
bombs on the enemy last year, btre- 
hiZ observed: "The 21st Bomber 
SSfSTfatorkhW on a 600,000 ton 
annual rate and its sister command 
the 20th, is not likely to be outdone 



easily. Both commands have been 
exceeding established goals, which 
hpve been made possible through 
extraordinary maintenance and supply 
efforts."

New Oty Could Be Rebuilt In 
2 Years, Engineer Aide Says 

t • ."A^ew Ma nila could be created in two years" yesterday declared Maj. Gen. 
I4el J. byerdrup, head of the Engineer Construction Command and one of Ameri- 
ca s ^ding engineers, now in charge of emergency reconstruction of the city. 

* ihe & e * ei ;al> Qualifying his optimistic answer with personal considerations 
of how the task could be accomplished said: "Manila should not be rebuilt into the 
city it was. A new city should be created on an entirely new pattern that would be 
well planned. On that basis a new and modern Manila could be remade in two 
years, and it could be made the showspot of the world." 
Sverdrup said his vision of a r 



streamlined Manila would fea- 
ture a port area of what is now 
the heart of the city. That, he 
pointed out, would eliminate the 
long hauling of goods from 
docks to their destination. What 
is now the business section of 
Manila, he thought, should be 
moved to Quezon City, thus 
creating one of the finest port 
areas and business districts in 
the world. 

The general declared the re- 
birth of architectural Manila 
"should not be a patchquilt, 
constructed haphazardly, build- 
ing by building. Millions of 
dollars will be spent," he ob- 
served, "and since planning is 
most important, I think it 
would be a good idea to spend 
some of that money to bring 
leading U. S. city planners to 
Manila to help."

joined by friendship, goodwill, 
mutuality and understanding." 

Members of the community 



could include China, India, Ma 
laya, Indonesia, Oceania, the 
Philippines, New Zealand, Aus- 
tralia, Canada, the United 
States, Mexico, and South 
American countries bordering 
on the Pacific, he said. 

Henry C. Cassidy, Associated 
Press correspondent, comment- 
ed such a "Pacific Community" 
would fit in "with the Dumbar- 
ton Oaks provision for regional 
arrangements to maintain se- 
curity such as those already 
made in the Americas." 



B-29 sSwing Another 
Heavy Blow at Tokyo 

20th Airforce Headquarters — A large force of 
B-29s bombed the Hidachi engine plant near Tokyo 
today for the first time. 

Other plants in the Tachikawa industrial area, just 
west of Tokyo, were attacked at the same time, a 20th 

Airforce announcement said. <S> 

It was the first time since 



was 

April 16 that the Superfor- 
tresses had struck in the Tokyo 
area, and marked a shift from 
the repeated, destructive attacks 
on airfields throughout the 
southern homeland island of 
Kyushu. 

Between 100 and 150 of the 
big bombers hit five Kyushu 
airfields Monday, only 24 hours 
after they had struck at nine 
Japanese fields on the afeme 
island on Saturday. Not a 
single bomber was lost in the 
Saturday's attacks.

Washington— The War De- 
partment announced yesterday 
all U. S. Army enlisted men 43

application. 

It was estimated that 60,000 
or more soldiers were eligible

RAF Rips 32 Nazi Troop Trains 
Moving North Toward Denmark 



London — Pilots of RAF 
Mosquito Bombers, which 
Tuesday nig** bombed ship- 
ping in Kiel Harbor, reported 
the? also attacked 32 troop 
trains moving north from 
Germany toward Denmark. 

Some of the pilots, making 
their fourth attack on Kiel in 
three nights, «aid traffic on 



roads and railroads from Ger- 
many into Denmark had been 
heavy since early yesterday. 
They added the trains were 
full of troops and that anti- 
aircraft fire was intense. 
Several railroad yards, in- 
cluding the Rendsburg yards 
on the way to Kfel*, were also 
hombed Tuesday night, a* well 



as shipping at Travenmuende 
on Luebeck Bay on the Baltic. 

Rocket-firing Beaufighters 
left a German freighter in 
flames and listing heavily in 
a Norway fjord. The air min- 
istry said the planes dived 
nearly 3,000 feet down the 
sides of cliffs to make the 
attack. 



Crack Defense 
Line and Seize 
21 Otv Districts 

Moscow— More than half 
of Berlin was in Russian 
hands, Moscow radio re- 
ported yesterday. This an- 
nouncement followed Pre- 
mier Stalin's two orders of 
the day revealing the First 
White Russian and First 
Ukrainian Armies had 
cleared 21 metropolitan 
districts of the German 
capital. 

Approximately 25,000 Ger- 
mans were killed or captured 
in or near Berlin in the part 
six days, the Soviet High Com- 
mand said. 

Inner Berlin's main defenw 
line, based on a railway em- 
bankment, was shattered, and 
Soviet troops captured the gaj 
works within two miles of Pot*. 
dammer Platz, which is th# 
heart of Berlin, Stalin ai* 
nounced. 

The Soviet high command, 
revealing two Red Army pin- 
cers were within 17 miles of 
closing a ring completely around 
Berlin, said one army had 
reached Henningsdorf and the 
other was at Marienfelde in the 
move to encircle the Reich 
capital. 

However, later reports froia 
other European sources, includ- 
ing the German radio itself, 
said Berlin's encirclement waa 
complete, presumably by junc- 
tion of these two columns. 

The Moscow newspaper 
hvestia said the Russian staff 
had set up headquarters in * 
Berlin suburb, but was prepar- 
ing to move soon into a "mo*§ 
central address." 

Reports reaching Moscow 
from Berlin said Red Army and 
Polish troops had penetrated 
deep into south Berlin, and 
captured whole blocks of streets 
and avenues, necessitating the 
setting up of a traffic control 
system. Red Army girls were 
standing a numerous comers in 
the suburbs and the city proper, 
directing the flow of trucks- 
some of them American made — 
and other military vehicles fa 
and out of Berlin. 

A Moscow broadcast told hoi? 
Russian tanks were filling the 
streets in such numbers as to 
hamper traffic. 

Meanwhile, a broadcast aaid 
Marshal Gregory K. Zhukov'g 
First White Russian Army f 
which was the first into Berlin, 
had broken into Chalottenburg, 
sprawling area of the German 
capital lying directly west of 
the business area. His forcet 
were beating straight acrow 
th* heart of Berlin.

Truman Hails U.N. Delegates as 24th Division 

"Architects of a Better World" 

A/cfes of 46 



Nations Start 
%, F. Mmikg 

San Francisco — The 
United Nations conference 
on international organiza- 
tion opened here yesterday 
afternoon, attending by 
statesmen of 46 nations, 
who, already certain of vic- 
tory in war, were meeting 
to draft a master plan for 
peace. 

President Truman, whose 
welcome was broadcast from 
Washington, told delegates they 
were to be "architects of a bet- 
ter world," and called upon them 
to achieve a peace worthy of the 
great sacrifice of their peoples. 

<r We must make certain by 
your work here that another 
war will be impossible," he said. 

Continuing, he observed : "We 
represent the forthcoming maj- 
ority of aU mankind. We rep- 
resent people who have endured 
the most savage cruelties inflict- 
ed on innocent men, women, and 
children. We hold a powerful 
mandate from our people. . .and 
we must prevent, if human mind, 
and heart can prevent, the re- 
petition of the disaster from 
which the entire world will suf- 
fer for years to come." 

(r We must not continue to 
iacrifice our youth merely to 
check bad men, those who in ever 
*ge plan world domination. 
Justice remains the greatest 
Pwer on earth and to that tre- 
mendous power alone will we 
submit,"

Americans Dent Jap Line 
On Southern Okinawa 

Okinawa — American Seventh Division troops 
broke the six day stalemate in the southern sector yes- 
terday, smashing into stubborn Japanese defenses near 
WUmhi^^ ■ ^ 

Yesterday's advance marked 
the first change along the Naha 
front since the capture of Ka- 
kuzu, Tuesday, when Army 
units in the center occupied the 
town and took important strong- 
points on a commanding hill to 
the left. To date, American 
Army and Marine forces have 
cleared three quarters of Okina- 
wa and yesterday they landed 
on three more small islands 
north of the Motobu peninsula. 

A Pacific fleet communique 
revealed Army and Marine 
forces during the Okinawa 
campaign had killed over 21,- 
000 Japs and taken 399 prison 
ers up to last Wednesday. Dur- 
ing the same period, 1,146 
American soldiers and Marines 
were killed, 5,973 wounded and 
about 289 are missing.

The 24th Division, in its 
rapid advance eastward 
along Highway One toward 
the city of Davao, yesterday 
drove within less than 20 
miles of the shores of 
Davao Gulf, General Mac- 
Arthur's communique an- 
nounced today. 

This represented a two-day 
advance of 28 miles, and the 
daily communiques have reveal- 
ed that the sweep is being close- 
ly coordinated with heavy aerial 
support. 

On Luzon, the communique 
told of continous pressure on 
the enemy by the American 
ground forces, while from the 
air, the Americans steadily 
pounded away to breach the 
Japanese defenses. 

More than 400 tons of bombs 
were dropped yesterday, and the 
communique declared that "ex- 
cellent results" were obtained. 

Daily pounding of Formosa 
targets continued, with heavies 
striking Matsuyama, Tainan 
and Kamka airdromes as well 
as rail yards at Tainan and 
Hokko. Two vessels were sunk 
at night in Formosa Strait and 
large fires were started among 
fuel stores in the Pescadores. 

American blockading planes 
wrecked 12 freighters and a 
number of river boats and 
patrol craft from Hongkong to 
southern Indo-China, while other 
American planes struck at rail- 
roads and rolling stock along 
the French Indo-China coast.

BUILDING A GREATER MANILA 

With proper planning and careful execution, says Maj, 
0en, Lief J. Sverdrup, head of the U, S, Army's Engineer Con- 
struction Command, Manila crmld be made "the showspot of 
the world/' in two years. 

Every Manila n should thrill to the challenge of General 
Sverdrup's statement. Here is an opportunity to rebuild this 
great metropolis along modern, efficient lines, to make a city 
that will be a pleasant place to work and live in. 

Broad highways, open parks, good residential districts, a 
great port area— these are only a few of the vistas which open 
on the future of Manila. Fortunately for the Philippines, Gen- 
eral MacArthur stands in a key position to help in this re- 
construction of the city that he has so long regarded as his I 
second home. As he goes about the great task of making 
Manila a base for military operations, he is certain to keep in 
mind the dream of making the city into a beautiful, modern 
metropolis* 

But the main responsibility must rest with the Philippine 
Commonwealth officials, as representatives of the Filipino 
people. They must see that the goal ahead is never lost sight 
of, that every facility and resource is thrown into the job to be 
done. American^Filipino cooperation has worked miracles in 
the path It has another great opportunity to set an example 
for the world by building a greater Manila.

Food Plentiful, Prices Cheap 
In Province of Camarines Norte 



Normal life has been restored 
in all the municipalities of Ca- 
marines Norte, declared Simon 
Diauna, military governor of 
that province who came, to 
Manila lagt week for a confer- 
once with Sec. Tomas Confesor. 
With him was Atty. Pedro A* 
Venida, liaison officer of the 
Vinzons Division, oldest and 
most famous guerrilla unit in 
the Bicol region. 

Except in out-of-the-way min- 
ing towns of Faracale, Mambu- 
lao and Capalonga, food is 
abundant, and prices amazingly 
low, in comparison with Manila 
prices- In Daet, the provincial 
capital, chicken eggs cost not 
more than five centavos each 
and a bunch of bananas sells 
r0.15. Pork is selling at PQ.80 
And beef at rU70. 

There is a shortage of work 
animals in the province, Diauna, 
because the Japs slaught- 



ered for food practically all 
carabaog and cattle they could 
catch. 

All the towns of Camarines 
Norte have been completely 
cleared of Japs, Diauna added. 
The Vinzona Division had 
harassed the Japs garrisoned in 
a few municipalities and 
advanced* unite of the Sixth 
Army mopped up resistance. 
Before the Japs fled they burn- 
ed the provincial capitol, the 
municipal building of Daet, the 
provincial barracks, and the his- 
toric town church, and blasted 
tlie Labo Bridge, one of the 
longest in the Philippines.

Labor Heads Propose 
PI and 3 Meals Daily 
For Army Laborers 

Filipino labor representatives 
yesterday proposed that the 
Civil Affairs unit of the XL S- 
Army pay laborers working on 
Army projects a minimum daily 
wage of PI, plus three daily 
meals. The daily basic pay set 
by both the TL S. Army and the 
Philippine Commonwealth is 
P1.26. 

The proposal was made by a 
committee of Filipino labor lea- 
ders including Hugo Manas, 
Antonio Paguia, Faustino Agui- 
lar, Felipe Jose P Domingo Pon- 
ce and Pascsual Casimiro, who 
are actively engage in mobiliz- 
ing men for Army work. 

According to Hugo Manas, 
who acted as spokesman for the 
committee, "There's no reason 
in the world why the U. S, 
Army should feel the scarcity 
of labor in Manila. There 
are thousands of laborers in the 
city who are in the ranks of 
the unemployed simply because 
they think they cannot make 
ends meet with a daily

Teodoro Alegre, Liberato Tinio and Ricardo de los 
Reyes, all members of the 515th Infantry, Ramsey's 
Guerrillas, are charged with frustrated murder in the 
Manila court of first instance for having injured 
Dominador Panis, an alleged Japanese spy, early last 
March. Judge Mamerto Roxas is hearing the case. 

Conrado V. Sanchez, assist-^ — 

ant city prosecuting attorney, 
contended during the trial that 
Alegre, Tinio, and De los Reyes, 
went to Panis's house early in 
the evening of March 5. The 
trio arrested Panis for being 
allegedly a Jap spy, at the same 
time knocking him on the head 
with the butt of a .45 caliber 
pistol. They then took him 
to their guerrilla headquarters 
on the corner of Legarda and 
Azcarraga streets in Sampal'oc. 

Alarmed, Panis* wife rushed 
to military police and reported 
her husband's case. An MP 
officer went to guerrilla head- 
quarters and found Panis still 



lying unconscious. The next 
day Alegre, Tinio and De los 
Reyes were booked for frustrat- 
ed murder. 

In their defense the guerrillas 
said Panis was an out-and-out 
Jap spy and claimed he had 
been responsible for the arrest 
and imprisonment of several 
other guerrillas in Manila. 

Liberato Tinio testified that 
Panis, in the company of two 
Filipino spies and a few Jap 
military police, arrested him one 
night, took him to the Jap gar- 
rison at the Canton Hotel on 
Calle Azcarraga and beat him 
up for being a guerrilla suspect.

Japanese 
30,000 Plane 
Total to Date 

Washington— The Japanese 
have lost approximately 30,000 
planes to IT. S» armed forces 
since the start of the war, ac- 
cording to a Navy compilation 
announced yesterday. Since Oct- 
ober 15, 1944, Navy airmen 
alone have destroyed more than 
7,500 Jap aircraft, the^ most 
disastrous 6-month period in the 
history of the Japanese navy 
and air forces The figure ex- 
ceeds the Navy's total bag of 
enemy planes destroyed in 3 
years and 10 months from Pearl 
Harbor to October 15, 1944. 

The sweeping sea offensive 
which began October 16, 1944, 
was just as disastrous to the 
Japanese Navy. In the 6 months 
period U. & naval forces and 
Army air forces sank a total of 
1,003 ships of all types, 208 of 
them combat vessels.

Patten's new advances placed 
his rampaging tanks and armor- 
ed troop carriers within 105 
miles of a junction with Russian 
forces striking across Austria. 
When these two great armies 
link up, the Americans and the 
Russians will have trapped all 
of the enemy in the Moravian" 
and Bohemian portions of Cze- 
choslovakia, 

Advances of 28 miles were 
reported on some sectors of the 
Third Army front. 

More than 19,000 Nazis, most- 
ly elite guards, were captured 
yesterday by the Third Army, 
and thousands more were being 
overrun and surrounded by Fat- 
ton's tank columns. 

On the Third Army's right 
flanjc, the Seventh Army beat 
down stiff German opposition 
and pushed out from seven 
Danube River bridgeheads to 
within 40 miles of Munich,

The United States Mourns 

First pictures of a nation in mourning for the death of President 
Roosevelt are available in today's Free Philippines. Above scene 
shows the 'lag over the United States Senate office building 
lowered in tribute. In the background is the dome of the U. S. 
Capitol. Other pictures showing the funeral cortege and cere-

Bremen Falls, Yanks 
9 Miles From Austria 



Russ Reach 
City's Heart; 
Take Stettin 

Lo ndo N — Victorious 
Russian forces burst into 
the heart of Berlin yester- 
day, as other Red Army 
units captured Stettin, 
Germany's last Baltic port, 
and Bruenn, Nazi arms 
center and capital of Mora- 
via. 

Late dispatches said the Rus- 
sians in Berlin were only 400 
yards froni the central head- 
quarters where, according to the 
Berlin radio, Adolph Hitler is 
personally directing the defense 
of the Nazi's burning capital. 

Stettin, anchor of the north- 
em wing of the now crumpled 
Berlin defenses, fell to Marshal 
Tfakqssovsky's new drive, which 
forced the lower Oder and crip- 
pled any. Nazi attempt to make a 
stand on the Mecklenburg Plain. 
Rokossovsky's troops crossed the 
Oder south of Stettin and swung 
the knockout punch at the city 
of 68,000. Other units advanced 
over 18 miles northeast and 
southwest of the port. 

The capture of Bruenn freed 
strong Soviet forces for a push 
into Bohemia and completion of 
the Czechoslovakian campaign.

army* meanwhile,, was

PARIS — Bremen, Germany's second port and an 
important submarine base, has fallen to the Allies, 
with all of the city except a dock area and a park in the 
hands of the British Second Army. 

Far to the south, the American Third Army drove 
within nine miles of Austria and 41 miles of Munich, 
crossing the Danube at three points and shattering that 
river line along a 180 mile front after by-passing the 
airplane manufacturing center of Regensburg. Gen. 
Patton's forces were meeting stiffer opposition from 
German troops massed in the mountainous terrain near 
Austria's border, only 72 miles from Hitler's roost at 
Berchtesgaden. 

Third Army forces inside Czechoslovakia were only 
35 miles f rom Pilsen and the Skoda arms work. 

The American Seventh Army was moving south 
and southeast toward Munich on a 60 mile front, while 
the French First Army completed envelopment of the 
Black Forest, sweeping up from the Swiss border all 
the way from Basle to Lake Constance. Konstanz fell 
to the French without a struggle. 

The American Ninth Army on the west bank of the 
Elbe was nearing a junction with the Russians, and 
Red Army units, also west of the Elbe, were not more 
than 20 miles from the American First Army along the 
west bank of the Mulde. The Ninth and British Second 
armies control 200 miles of the Elbe's west bank from 
Hamburg to Dessau. 

The Canadians overran Kirchhatten on the way to 
Oldenburg, were within four miles of Erhden and were 
menacing Wilhelmshaven as well. 



Americans Win Peaks 
Above Balete Pass 

Advancing behind strong formations of American 
bombing, rocket firing and strafing planes, the 24th 
Division on Mindanao has battled its way 10 miles 
through the rugged Apo Mountain range to within sight 
of Digos on Davao Gulf, while the 25th Division on 
Luzon in a surprise night attack has seized commanding 
positions on the high ground southeast of and overlook- 
ing Balete Pass. . 

Dive bombers, medium bombers and fighters smash- 
ed at the fleeing Japanese ahead of the 24th Divisions 
drive toward Davao, General MacArthur announced in 
his communique today. 

Seizure of the important positions commanding the Balete 
Pass climaxed the night attack over rugged mountain ridges and 
throueh intricate enemy defenses, the campaign disclosed. 

The Americans captured fi ve Japanese tanks intact and 
turned them upon the enemy. 



Meanwhile, an American 
aerial smash at Basco airfield 
in the Batan Islands north of 
Luzon left that airdrome use- 
less to the enemy. General Mac- 
Arvhur reported that 730 tons 
of bombs were dropped on the 
Basco field and on enemy rear 
installations in the Cagayan 
Valley. 

The daily aerial .attacks on 
Formosa were centered on in- 
dustrial plants yesterday, with 
American fliers blasting fac- 
tories in the Taito, Koshun and 
Heito areas. Others swept the 
western coastal plain, while pa- 
trol planes harassed Taihoku 
airdrome and sank five enemy 
freighters off the Nansei Isles. 



BULLETIN 

ROME — U. S. Fifth Army 
troops, in a whirlwind drive 21 
miles north of bypassed Man- 
tua, last night captured Verona, 
gateway city to the Po Plain 
and virtually sealed off the 
Brenner Pass escape route of 
German armies in Italy. 

Naxi forces south of the 
Alps appeared entirely disor- 
ganized and the total prisoners 
taken since the new Allied drive 
opened soared well past 
60,000.

interferes with the freedom of the press in any country of the

which will follow this war to guarantee freedom of the press 
everywhere. 

Last night Dean Ackermdn, taking part in a Philippine Hour

'NO TIME TO LOSE_ 

Meets With Top Chiefs 



Cites Imminent 
Nazi Collapse 
At S. F. Parley 

San Francisco — Secretary of 
State Edward R. Stettin ius, 
addressing the first business 
plenary session of the United 
Nations conference yesterday 
afternoon , told delegates prepa- 
ration of a charter for world 
peace organization should not be 
entangled with the many and 
complex political and economic 
issues involved in the defeat of 
Japan and Germany, 

Stettin i us emphasized the 
"imminent collapse of organized 
German resistance makes it all 
the more important a world 
organization be established at 
the earliest possible moment. 

"To deal with these and 
other issues, there will have to 
be many other conferences and 
many other decisions, both na- 
tional and international. We 
have no time to lose," 

He declared, "we have made 
a better beginning than nations 
have ever made before" toward 
assuring a just and lasting 
peace - in which the "peoples of 
the world can work together to 
retrieve at test, freedom from 
fear and from want." 

Goering Quits! 
Says He*s Sick 

London— The German radio 
reported Marshal Hermann 
Goering had asked Hitler to re- 
lieve him of command of the 
German airforce "because of 
serious heart trouble," Reuters 
said , last night 

The Nazi broadcast, describ- 
ing Goerinjr's condition as 
'acute", said Hitler had' ap- 
pointed General Ritter Von 
Greln to command of the Ger- 
man air force and promoted 
him to the rank of field mar- 
shal general. 

The radio account said Goer, 
mg had been suffering from 
heart trouble for some time. 
Whereabouts of Goering — No.

Washington- — American oc-

are going to be extremely care-

Elmer Davis, director of the 
Office of War Information, told 
a recent press conference. 

Mr. Davis, just returned from 
a tour of the European theatre 
of war f declared American 
authorities are certainly going 
to publicize news of Nasi atroci. 
ties in German concentration 
camps. 

Asked whether official news 
would continue ito be supplied 
after the military occupation of 
Germany ends, he replied there 
would certainly hiive to be some- 
thing; adding the OWI had 
some ideas on the subject which 
it wanted to submit to the State 
Department.

PARIS— Simultaneous announcements from Wash- 
ington, London, and Moscow today revealed the historic 
junction of Allied armies from the east and west in Ger- 
many. 

Junction was effected Thursday at Torgau, 70 miles 
south of Berlin on the Elbe River, when swift moving U. S. 
,69th Division troops of the American First Army con- 
tacted Russian columns swinging below the German capi- 
tal 

The 69th Division on April 13 smashed into Leipzig, 
captured the nearby city of Leuna two days later, and 
was credited with clearing out all resistance in Leipzig 
on April 19. 

WASHINGTON — President Harry S. Truman yes- 
terday announced the junction of Soviet and American 
forces in Germany.. Press Secretary Jonathan Daniels 
saiad the [unction off ically took place Thursday at Torgau, 
a town on the Elbe River, south of Berlin. . Truman said: 

"The Anglo-American armies under command , of 
General Eisenhower have met the Soviet forces where 
they intended to meet — in the heart off Germany.. The 
enemy has been cut in half. 

"This is not the hour of final victory in Europe, but 
the hour draws near, the hour for which all the American 
people, all the British peoples,* and all the Soviet peoples 

have toiled and prayed so long. 

The union of our arms in the heart of Germany . . . means, 
first, that the last faint desperate hope of Hitler and his gangster 
government has been extinguished. The common front and the 
common cause of the powers allied in this war against tyranny 
and inhumanity have been demonstrated in fact as they have long 



been demonstrated in determination. Nothing can divide or 
weaken the common purpose of our veteran armies to pursue their 
victorious purposes to its final Allied triumph in Germany. 

'The junction of our forces at this moment signalizes to our- 
selves and to the world that the collaboration of our nations 
in the cause of peace and freedom is an effective collaboration 
which can surmount the greatest difficulties of the most extensive 
campaign in world's history. Nations that plan and fight together 
shoulder to shoulder in the face of such obstacles of distance and 
of language as they have overcome, can live and work together 
in the common labor of the organization of the world for peace. 

"Finally, this great triumph of Allied arms and Allied 
strategy is such a tribute to the courage and determination of 
Franklin Roosevelt as no words could ever speak, and that could 
be accomplished only by the persistence and courage of the citizen 
soldiers and sailors of the Allied nations. 

"But until our enemies are finally subdued in Europe and in 
the Pacific there must be no relaxation of the effort on the home 
front in support of our heroic soldiers and sailors as we all know 
there will be no pause on the battle fronts."' 




LONDON — Prime Minister 
Winston Churchill issued the fol- 
lowing statement today follow- 
ing the union of Allied forces in 
Germany : 

"After long journey's, toils 
and victories across the whole of 
Europe and after many bloody 
and hard battles in Germany, 
the Allies havve joined hands. 
Now their task will be the de- 
struction of all remnants of 
German military resistance. Our 
forces meet in true and victor- 
ious comradeship and with the 



inflexible resolve to fulfill our 
purpose and our duty. Let us 
all march forward upon the foe." 

MOSCOW— Salvoes of guns 
and ringing of bells today greet/- 
ed Marshal Josef Stalin's an- 
nouncement of the junction of 
Russian and American forces. 
Stalin said: 

"In the name of the Soviet 
Union, I congratulate you, com- 
manders and men of the Red 
Army and of the armies of our

Junction hfGermany 
Greatest Pincers In ™ l*}™7 



oses 



SAN FRANCISCO — By the junction in Germany of Russian 
and American forces, the most powerful armies ever to take the 
field in the world's history had fought their way from the extreme 
edges of two continents to close the greatest military pincers ever 
fashioned. 

These pincers compressed to nothing the aggressive military 
empire at one time guarded by at least nine million hardened 
troops who had spread their conquest 2200 miles from Brittany 
in the West to the Volga River in Russia by August 1942, 

In that month German power stretched without Allied in- 
terruption from Norway's North Cape to Vichy, France's naval 
base at Dakar over 4000 miles away. German forces wera then 
beginning to batter their way into Russia's last big southern city 
before the Ora]s — Stalingrad some 13000 miles from their home- 
land* 

In the Sahara, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel then feared as 
the desert fox, had his forces drawn up before El Alamein with 
Alexandria 60 miles away and the Suez Isthmus to Asia not far 
beyond. In Asia, Japan was threatening an invasion of India as 
a step in the overall Axis strategy to form a junction with the 
Nazis somewhere on that continent. 

This was the picture as. the third year of Germany's war 
came to a close and Soviet and Western Allies made their first 
moves on the long comeback road. 

On October 23, 1942 came the initial change. Field Marshal 
Sir Bernard Montgomery's British Eighth Army, re-equipped 
with American tanks, opened the last of the great offensives 
which had seen the African battle front sweep back and forth 
six times across Egypt's desert and Italian Libya, 

On November 7 f British and American forces under Ger. 
Dwight Eisenhower made surprise landings on the Alantic and 
Mediterranean coasts of French Morocco and Algeria, Within 
days, half-hearted French defenses had ceased resistance. 

Then, on November 22, Moscow announced the Red Army 
had opened its Stalingrad counter-offensive which by February 
22, 1943, compelled the encircled German remanents there to sur- 
render, and the great German retreat from Russia was on, 

Meanwhile, Montgomery's forces . battled their way across 
Libya, and by March 7 had linked up with Eisenhower's troops 
in southern Tunisia, The Allies then fought up to Cap Bon where 
the last Axis troops .'n North Africa surrendered on May 12, 
clearing the way for landings on Sicily on July 10, Calabria, Italy, 
September 3, and Salerno, Italy on September 9 when Italy sur- 
rendered. 

Thus the future pincers which were to encircle Hitler's great- 
er Germany itself began to take shape. 

The Russian's military colossus — its strength reborn with 
the help of lend-lease equipment — rolled back the Nazi Wehrmacht 
in successive pushes until early 1944, when the Polish-Russian 
border was recrossed. British and American forces which had 
met in Tunisa had pushed northward in Italy until on June 4 
1944, the first Axis capital — Rome — was capured. 

But Rome was hardly in the headlines when June 6 saw the 
long-awaited D-Day invasion of France. Eisenhower's Allied 
forces cracked the Nazi's vaunted Atlantic wall, and aided by 
unprecedented airpower, established beachheads on Normandy's 
coast

who hoped to remake the world into a vassal for Germany hav* 
failed and the day of their final annihilation cannot be lone de- 
lay ed 

On those whose main interests lie in the Pacific, the signific- 
ance of the great European victory cannot be lost. First, the 
United States will no longer be forced to fight major wars on two 
fronts. Second, Britain will be able to send ships and planes in 
ever-increasing numbers to aid in the war against Japan. Final- 
ly, Russia will now be free, if she so chooses, to join in the as- 
sault on Japan. 

All of which adds up to about the worst news the Japanese 
have received since Pearl Harbor. But for the rest of the world, 
and especially here in the Philippines where we are still fighting 
a front-line action, this should be a day of great rejoicing. 



These weeks saw the liberation 
of Paris, Brussels, Luxembourg, 
Bucharest, Sofia, Athens and 
Belgrade. 

Meanwhile, Soviet forces ex- 
ploded in the east, capturing 
Warsaw on January 17 of this 
year. On February 4, Marshal 
Zhukov's First White Russian 
Army crosed the Oder River to 
knife within 31 miles of Berlin 
at one point. 

The Nazis managed to re- 
establish a line along the Oder 
and Neisse Rivers facing the 
Russians, only to he over-

Above the rattle of machineguns and the

as a building topples and crashes into the street. 
Before the noise has subsided Allied troops rush 
forward to gain further ground. 

Night and day, ears are deafened by the

Washington last night there was any truth to the rumor 
of Germany's surrender which emanated from the Sail 
Francisco conference and spread like wildfire through 
out the world. 

The peace rumor, flashed by the Associated Presb 
quoted a high official of the American delegation latei 
identified as Sen- Tom Connally, Democrat of Texas and 
chairman of the Senate 
Foreigtn Relations Commit- 
tee* 

Learning of the Prcsi* 
dent's denial, Connally said 
he still believed official 
news would be forthcoming 
in a matter of hours. Ear- 
lier he said the announce- 
ment might come from Gen- 
eral Eisenhower's Supreme 
Allied Headquarters, 

However, General Eisen- 
hower later issued a state- 
ment to the Army news- 
paper Stars and Stripes in 
t*aris saying he had no in- 
formation at all on an/ Ger- 
man surrender. 

The first news of the dra- 
matic developments in Eu- 
rope came Saturday night 
when Reuters reported 
Heinrich Himmlei\ chief of 

the German Gestapo, had offered unconditional sm 
render to Great Britain and the United States. Accoro 
ing to the Reuters report, Britain and the United Stat© 
said they would not accept unconditional surrender e* 
ccpt on behalf of all Allies, including Russia* 

Prime Minister Churchill issued a statement sayinf 
his government "had no information to give at this mC 
ment" about the "various reports of proposals for GeT 
man surrender.*' Rut he emphasized "only uncond? 
tional surrender to the three major powers will be ente? 

tained/' . _ _ , . . , 4 

The Russian Tass news agency said last nignt i 
had been "authorized to state" that reports of Himir 
ler's offer were "confirmed in responsible Soviet quaJ 
ters," 

Himmler's peace offer was reportedly transmitter 
to the Allies through the Swedish Foreign Office. 

The first Associated Press report said Germany hai 
surrendered unconditionally to Allied governments am 
"announcement is expected momentarily according to t 
hi«h American official/ 5 ^ * 




Heinrich Himmler 



SHIP NAMED FOR PYLE 

Washington— The Maritime 
commission announced Saturday 
that it wilt name a C-4 military 

[tvne cargo vessel after Ernie 
Pvle ( war correspondent who 

was killed last week on Okinawa. 



This report led the White 
House to announcd that if the 
official confirmation of Ger- 
many's unconditional surrender 
came, President Truman would 
issue a proclamation and read 
it over the radio. 

Throughout the Allied world, 
the peace rumors touched off 
wild demonstrations of joy. 
Security Conference delegates 
broke into cheers when one 
member held up a newspaper 
headlined "Nazis Quit." 

Throngs gathered around the 
prates of the White House eatrer- 
Iv waiting details* In New 
York's Times Square, jubilation 
subsided as news of Truman's 
denial was flashed. In London 
many thousands of men and 
women including servicemen of 
all nationalities began dancing 
in the streets, 

Truman's announcement that 
the reports were unfounded 
failed to dampen spirits. Simi- 
lar demonstrations occurred m 
TCio de Janeiro. There, as in 
Montreal, later 'denials were 
ignored by celebrating throngs.

2. No offer will be accepted unless it is made to all the

JUNCTURE HERALDED AS OMEN 
OF SECURE POST-WAR WORLD 

Washington — In announcing the linking up 
of Russian and American armies in Germany, 
President Truman yesterday declared the military 
cooperation resulting in the juncture was an omen 
of world collaboration in safeguarding future peace. 

The juncture was simultaneously announced 
in statements by Truman in Washington, Churchill 
in London, and Stalin in Moscow. 

Truman said, in part: 

"The Anglo-American armies, under command 
of General Eisenhower have met the Soviet 
forces where they intended to meet — in the heart 
of Germany. The enemy has been cut in half. 

This is not the hour of final victory in 
Europe, but the hour draws near, the hour for 
which all the American people, "all the British 
and the Soviet have toiled and prayed so long. 

"The union of our arms means that the last 
faint desperate hope of Hitler and his gangster 
government has been extinguished. Nothing can 
divide or weaken the common purpose of our 
veteran armies to pursue their victorious purpose 
to its final triumph in Germany." 

In Moscow, salvoes of guns and ringing of 
bells echoed Stalin's announcement. He said: 

"The victorious armies of the Allied powers j 
have routed the Germans and linked up on the i 
territory of Germany. Our task and our duty are | 
to complete the destruction of the enemy, to force 
him to lay down his arms and surrender uncon- 
ditionally^ gtatemerit from London> Churchill said: 
"After long journey's, toils and victories, the 
allies have traversed Lr«UH 
hands. Now their tasks

SaysW arW ill End in a FewDays 

With U. S. 9th Army in Germany— General 
Kurt Dittmar, most widely quoted ftrateffist ox 
the German High Command, surrendered y este *" 
day. He told American officers Germany lost me 
war politically when Hitler escaped assassination 
last July and militarily when Germany laileci to 
stop the Normandy invasion according to an 
Assoc T "ated Press dispatch. . 

His favorite theme was that things might have 
been different had Hitler been assassinated. Had 
it succeeded, he said, German army leaders might 
have engineered surrender. 

Dittmar insisted the war was bound to end 
in a few days, saying there had been no German 
military strategy in the last six months. He re- 
vealed Germany had suffered too many casualties 
to tie i able to continue the war after Berlin falls. 

'Still castigating Hitler, Dittmar observed that 
the G'ejrtnan High Command's first intimation of 
their Eventual doom was Stalingrad, and that the 
Njorniajidy invasion was the turning point of the 
war- ■ |The failure of the German counter attack 
in Brittany last summer ended their last hope of 
stopping the Allies in the west, he said, adding 
when Hitler took over strategy army leaders knew 
they had lost the war. 

Dittmar was rowed across the Elbe River by 
two German enlisted men under a white flag,

Strategic Job Ends in Europe; 
Planes Will Shift to Pacific 

PARIS— Gen. Carl Spaatz, U. S. Strategic Air Force 
commander in Europe, declared yesterday that strategic 
bombing has finished its job in Europe, and its forces, per- 
sonnel and planes will be shifted to the Pacific as soon as 
they can be put to use there. 

An Associated Press dispatch said Spaatz was speak- 
ing specifically of Americans, but in answer to a question 
as to the British bomber command's participation in the 
Pacific theatre, he said "It certainly can be assumed our 
Allies will take a full part in the war there too."

Stalin said in his special 
order that the Germans had lost

Apparently referring to Hein-

Great Britain, Stalin said: 

"In the search for a way out

Russians Free 
Herriot, Former 
French Premier 

Moscow — Edouard Herriot, 
three times premier of France 
and former president of th« 
French Chamber of DeputieSj 
arrived in Moscow with hit 
wife yesterday after being 
liberated by the Russian array 
from Germans near Berlin. 

The 73-year-old French 
statesman was freed April 22. 
and was brought to the Russian 
capital in a special plane placed 
at his disposal by Soviet mil) 
tary authorities at Berlin. H< 
said he was in good health. 

He said he would remain it 
Moscow for a few days and 
then return to France. Herriot 
was originally arrested by the 
Vichy police after he had criti- 
cized the collaborationist policy 
of the Petain government 



Regime Marked 
By Terrorism 

Rome— Benito Mussolini, who was executed by Italian 
patriots Saturday in northern Italy following a trial, latheiea 
Fascism in Italy and set the pattern of oppression and myraer 
followed by Hitler in Germany. 

Formerly editor of a Socialist newspaper in northern Italy, 
he turned against his friends and supporters in 1919 *<> or ^ nlz ® 
the Fascisti to fight Socialism and Communism. The JjJlacK 
Shirts, so called because of their uniform, were formed March 46, 
1919, and grew rapidly from the original membership of about 
150 ex-soldiers of the last world war. 

Following a general strike in Italy in the summer of 1922, 
the Black Shirts marched on Rome and seized the power m a blood- 
less revolution on Oct. 24. The Fascists took over the government 
at the invitation of King Victor Emmanuel. 
As leader of the Fascisti and^ 



head of the government, Musso- 
lini, or II Duce as he styled him- 
self, acquired dictatorial powers 
over the life of the country. The 
Fascist party at one time exer- 
cised at one time exercised vir- 
tual control over the private and 
public activity of the nation. 

In 1935, Mussolini launched 
his attempt at conquest with the 
unprovoked attack on ill-armed 
Ethiopia, which was defeated in 
about a year by the mechannized 
army of Mussolini aided by mer- 
ciless aerial bombing. 

With the outbreak of the 
Spanish civil war in 1936, Mus- 
solini threw his legions behind 
Francisco Franco, again using 
hiodern armament against the 
poorly equipped Spanish Social- 
ists. 

In April, 1939, after Hitler 
had absorbed Czechoslovakia, 
Mussolini again struck at a prac- 
tically defenseless nation, this 
time marching into Albania, just 
across the Adriatic from Italy. 

In June,* 1940, the France tot- 
tering under the assault of the 
Nazis, Mussolini attacked 
France, calling forth from Presi- 
dent Roosevelt the famous "stab 
in the back" speech. The follow- 
ing October, Mussolini started a 
war of "self defense" against 
Italy. Here) he met> stern oppo- 
sition until Hitler came to his 
aid. 

The Allied campaign in North 
Africa started the Fascist re- 
gime on the road to collapse. 
With the Italians driven from 
Libya and Tunisia, the Allies 
swept over Sicily and landed in 
Italy in July, 1943. On July 25, 
King Emmanuel accepted the re- 
signation of Mussolini and his 
Fascist cabinet, who fled to 
northern Italy. 

As the Allied campaign in 



Italy moved inexorably forward, 
Mussolini sought the protection 
of Hitler and became the titular 
puppet of an empty regime: 
Then on Saturday came the trial 
and execution which ended his 
years of despotism and terror. 

JAPANESE PLANE 
HITS HOSPITAL SHIP 

Guam — The United States 
hospital ship Comfort* was 
heavily damaged by a Japanese 
plane off Okinawa, according to 
an announcement today by Ad- 
miral Nimitz. Casualties on the
