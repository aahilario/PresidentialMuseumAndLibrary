bian de la Rosa in 1911 ob- 
M serving their arts. He would 
have gone to Europe after- 
;* | ward f o r the perfection 
>; ' * \ of his art, but his parents

BATANGAS 

GEOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 



BATANGAS, situated on the southwestern coast of Luzon, borders 
on the China Sea, with Cavite and Laguna on the north and 
Laguna and Tayabas on the east. The coast is very irregular, Ba- 
layan and Batangas Bays being the largest indentations, while Na- 
sugbu, Talin, Santiago, Janao and Coloconte Bays also offer good 
anchorage. Off the western coast of the province there are several 
reefs, but these present no difficulty to the navigator entering the 
harbors. The most important ports are Nasugbu, Calatagan, Balayan, 
Calaca, Lemery, Taal, San Luis, Bauan, Batangas, Lobo and San Juan. 
Maricaban and Verde are islands on the southwest coast. The former 
is mountainous and forested. At Laiya off the coast between San 
Juan and Lobo are the famous Lobo submarine gardens. During fair 
weather the water is as clear as crystal and the submarine growth 
may be seen in all its varied colors and interesting splendor. 

The province is considered the most picturesque in the Archipelago, 
particularly on account of its wide perspectives and of Lake Bombon, 
in the center of which is an island formed by the crater of Taal 
Volcano. Inside this crater there is also a lake where formerly there 
were three. Taal Volcano has experienced several destructive erup- 
tions during historic times, the last one being in January, 1911. Lake 
Taal (Bombon) is about 10 meters deep and 2.5 meters above sea level. 
It is said that formerly sea water from Balayan Bay flowed through 
the Pansipit River into Lake Taal, and boats could therefore pass into 
the interior of the province. Other mountains are the Batulao ran^e 
to the west of Lake Taal, Malocot, and Malarayat on the east, and 
Lobo, Bartolino, and Banoy on the south. The mountains on the west 
are covered with vegetation in contrast with those of the east which 
are almost bare. 

The climate is warm and humid though it varies locally according 
to topography. It may be divided into three seasons: first between 
he end of October and the beginning of March when the north winds 
brine very little rain; second, between March and the beginning of 
July when the dry and warm south and east winds blow; third be- 
tween July and October when the winds of the second quadrant bring 
hurricanes and typhoons. 

The valleys and slopes of this rugged country are extremely fer- 
tile because of the disintegrated volcanic rock that is carried down 
from the mountains by the rivers. Rice, sugar, hemp, citrus fruits, 
coconuts corn, mangoes, and other fruits and vegetables are grown in 



BATANGAS DIRECTORY 



abundance for local use and (rice excepted) for export use. Formerly, 
coffee was one of the principal sources of wealth, but the blight has 
ruined the industry. Efforts are now being made to reestablish it. 

The forests cover an area of about 97,965 hectares. They are 
thickest in the regions of Santo Tomas, San Juan, and Rosario. Lum- 
bang seed for oil, paints varnishes, and illumination purposes and 
lumber are exported. Great herds of horses, famous throughout the 
Archipelago, carabao and cattle are raised on the mountain slopes. 

The shores and lakes abound in fish. Lake Bombon furnishes a 
great supply although it is said that much of the fish caught therein 
has to be well seasoned to rid it of its disagreeable sulphur taste. 

The land is well drained by rivers and streams, the most important 
being Calumpag, Pansipit, Palico, Obispo, Malaquing Hog, and Ban- 
coro. Outside of its mineral springs and sulphur, Batangas has no 
mineral wealth except some copper ore. The San Juan sulphur 
springs, the Bauan hot springs, and the Rosario fresh water spring 
are the most famous. Aside from the above, Batangas may well be 
proud of her caves and grottos. The two largest are found in the 
slopes of the Mount Pulan Suya and Camantigue of San Juan, one of 
which has an opening 40 meters in circumference. Issuing therefrom 
is an underground river which connects with Lake Taal and flows 
through the Batulao range. Along its course are extensive galleries 
and chambers lined with fantastically shaped stalactites and stalag- 
mites; and at the approach of an eruption of Taal Volcano, it emits a 
weird sound, audible at great distances. 

The inhabitants of the province are Tagalog. Bauan and Lipa 
are famous for the fine jusi and pina cloths manufactured there and 
for the knotted abaca that is sent to Japan for the manufacture of 
Tagal hats. Embroidery is a growing industry. Trading is exten- 
sively carried on and in each of the towns is a market for the sale of 
its particular products. 

This province has 25 municipalities and 552 barrios. Its capital 
is Batangas with a population of 41,182. It is located in the south 
central part of the province. Lipa, was declared Chartered City by the 
Congress and was inaugurated on Aug. 31st, 1947. 

HISTORICAL ACCOUNT 

At the time of the arrival of the Spaniards there were already, 
in what is now Batangas Province, large centers of population like 
Nasugbu, Balayan, and Batangas. Native settlements also existed 
along the Pansipit River. These settlements are believed to have been 
in existence long before the Spaniards discovered the Philippines. In 
fact, according to tradition, the region now known as Batangas was 
settled by Dato Balensusa and Dato Dumangsil, two of the ten datos 



BATANGAS DIRECTORY 



iii 



who purchased Panay Island from the Negritos. It is believed that 
these two datos founded the first Malay villages at the mouth of Taal 
River. 

Batangas was explored by Martin de Goiti and Juan de Salcedo 
on their way to Manila in 1570. From Mindoro, these two brave ex- 
plorers crossed over to the coast of Batangas. Goiti went directly to 
and explored the neighborhood of Balayan, while Salcedo sailed up 
the Pansipit River into the interior. Rejoining each other at Balayan, 
Goiti and Salcedo then proceeded to Manila, sailing along the western 
coast of Batangas, then kown as the region of Tuley. 

The Province of Batangas was created in 1581, its jurisdiction 
extending over a vast territory including what is now Batangas, Min- 
doro, Marinduque, and all the land southeast of Laguna as far as 
Camarines. The name of the province was then Bombon, or Balayan, 
with the capital at the town of Balayan. At a later date, the outlying 
regions were separated and Batangas proper became the only consti- 
tuent part of the province. 

The name of the province was changed twice during the 18th 
century. In 1732, the capital, was moved from Balayan to Taal and 
the whole province was called, from that time on, after its new capital. 
But in 1754, when Batangas became the provincial capital, the present 
name was adopted. 

Throughout the seventeenth century the coast towns of Batangas 
suffered greatly from Moro attacks. During Acuna's rule, for exam- 
ple, the Moro pirates committed depradations on the coast villages. 
Stone forts were erected at various points along the coast ^ 1 ^^.^ 
Taal, Bauan, and Batangas— but still the Moros came. In 1 (>/*>, cney 
captured the town of Balayan, and in 1754 thirty-eight of their vessels 
appeared off the coast of Batangas. 

Another periodical source of danger to the people of Batangas 
was the Taal Volcano. This volcano, which from time immemoria 
the natives had looked upon with superstitious interest erupted 
times during the eighteenth century. As a result of its eruption ^ 
1716 and 1754, several towns in the neighborhood were ruined Its 
eruption in the nineteenth century did not result in so much destruc- 
tion but the most recent one was accompanied by heavy loss m human 
lives and property. 

In 1763, the northern part of Batangas was visited by the British. 
It will be remembered that an expedition under the command of Baric- 
house was sent by the British authorities then occupying Manila m 
search of the treasure of the galleon "Philippine." The expedition 
which failed to find the coveted treasure went as far as Lipa and 
plundered the town.

BATANGAS DIRECTORY 



The history of Batangas during the nineteenth century was that 
of a period of economic growth. Coffee, which was introduced in 
1814, became the most important crop of the province. From the 
time of its introduction into Lipa, that town became very prosperous. 
Lipa, alone, in 1887, produced 70,000 piculs of coffee. This crop, how- 
ever, subsequently began to diminish until it was practically destroyed 
in 1892. 

Batangas was one of the first provinces to start the Revolution. 
Two of the few great leaders of this period were sons of Batangas, 
namely, the great lawyer and statesman Apolinario Mabini and Miguel 
Malvar, the famous general. When the Revolutionary Government 
was established, Manuel Genato served for sometime as provincial 
governor of Batangas. 

Civil government was established on May 2, 1901.

BATANGAS, AFTER LIBERATION 

— 

Batangas, one of the most flourishing provinces in the Philippines 
before the war, with several imposing towns bristling with commercial 
and industrial activities, did not escape the destruction wrought by 
the recent World War II. Its fate during the Occupation was char- 
acterized by horrible spectacles of wholesale murder of the populace 
by the Japanese soldiers; deprivation of homes and commandeering 
of household belongings and food supplies; destruction of roads and 
bridges, telephone and telegraph lines, and all other means of trans- 
portation and communication; the complete destruction of the towns 
of Sto. Tomas, Tanauan, Malvar, Lipa, San Jose, Lemery, Rosario, Ba- 
tangas, Bauan, Cuenca, Alitagtag and San Luis; and the crippling 
of the major industries as well as home industries of the province. 

As a result of the different destructions brought about by the 
war, commerce and business was temporarily paralyzed. Depletion 
of manpower occasioned by wholesale massacre of the people during: 
the last days of the Japanese occupation and employment of many men 
in army jobs which they found much more remunerative than any other 
jobs during the early part of the liberation, were among the major 
causes which put Batangas into a state of unproductivity. 

The Government, aware of the widespread devastations in Batan- 
gas, made all efforts towards its rehabilitation. With the help of the 
U. S. Army Forces, bridges and roads were reconstructed, public build- 
ings were gradually erected, and financial aids were extended to both 
commercial and industrial firms in order to help them reestablish their 
prewar business. Likewise, barong-barongs were gradually replaced by 
semi-permanent residential houses. Little by little, the province is re- 
gaining its prewar tempo of business. It is feared, however, that the 
major export products of the province cannot be rapidly restored to 
their normal status, on account of the extreme shortage of labor and 
the timidity of capital. It is believed that capital is reluctant to enter 
the industrial fields for the reason that the need for foodstuffs, cloth- 
ing, and other prime commodities is given top priority by many people 
of the province. 



BATANGAS DIRECTORY xi 



Prices of commodities for a considerable length of time after li- 
beration skyrocketed to a high level. With the advent of 1946, how- 
ever, the markets were flooded with imported commodities which were 
denied the people during the war, and these caused the prices of these 
commodities to decline. Prices, as those in other provinces of the Phil- 
ippines, could not be kept at a stable level because of frequent strikes 
in the United States and a number of strikes in the Philippines. 

Cost of labor had soared high under those situations. Thus a la- 
borer could make more money than an average chief of an office or 
bureau. Common laborers earned as much as P5 to P8 a day and ped- 
dlers as much as P15 to P30 a day. Comparatively, army laborers were 
paid less; they got Pl.75 to P2.50 a day, but many preferred to work 
with the Army because of the chances of buying cheap GI goods which 
they resold to civilians at a good profit. 

In the early part of 1947, business activity in the province greatly 
improved. More participation in retail business was noted and the 
production of food crops was greatly increased. Public works projects 
were released and greater financial aids for businessmen and indus- 
trialists were secured from government agencies, causing the increase 
in volume of business of the province. Lumber mills, lime factories, 
and sugar centrals started operating. 

Unfortunately, the closing of the surplus base R in Batangas 
brought thousands of civilian employees and laborers to u« em P loy "? ' 
but this tended to increase the agricultural production of the P r0 g 
as those unemployed had to go back to their farms. Home in ^ 
were then reactivated and gradually reached their prewar status. ^ 
broidery, sinamay weaving, livestock raising, interisland shippn g, 
fishing are considered at present the most active home industnes 
province. 

Reconstruction of vacation resorts such as Balite Beach iti > Lipa 
the Pancipit in Taal, and the Tinga Waterfalls in Batangas, have also 
been begun and new streamlined hotels and restaurants 
theaters have sprung up to the joy of travelers and traders espec.a Uy 
in Batangas, Batangas. As of the first quarter of 1947, tt-jj 
showhouses were registered for the entire province with at least one 
for every town in the province, except Batangas and Lipa, wheie each 
registered four theaters. 

With the present strides of business in the province and the im- 
provements of transportation and communications in the Philippines 
as a whole, it is believed that Batangas will soon resume its place as 
one of the leading and industrial centers in Luzon.

The Philippine Charity Sweepstakes 

By Paterno S. Garcia 

When the Philippine Legislature in 1934 created the Philippine 
Charity Sweepstakes Office by Act 4130, little thought was given to 
the fact that a potential institution was being organized to finance 
the charitable and health activities being conducted by various insti- 
tutions for the benefit of the Filipino indigent masses. 

At the head of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office now 
is the Honorable Jose A. Dorado, former representative for many years 
from Capiz. He assumed management of this Office on January 1, 
1947. 

The Office has so far held 34 draws since 1935, besides the first 
two draws sponsored by the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation 
and the third and fourth by the National Charity Sweepstakes. Since 
liberation there have been held eight draws which have grossed a total 
of p l6,521,750.00 of which P4,130,437.50 is earmarked for the Charity 
Fund. 

At this writing a total of P53,G03,520.88 has been ^rived from all 
draws before and after the war. Of this amount, P32 3 17,867 45 corn- 
Prises the prize fund; P13,352,096.32, the charity fund; »£JfJ™l 
the provincial and city fund, and P5,489,150.50, the ^^^Jj 
According to Act No. 4130, as amended by Commonwealth Acts « i . 
301 and 546 and Republic Act No. 72, the proceeds of sales ot sweep 
stakes tickets should be apportioned as follows: 

58.5% Prizes to subscribers 

25* % Charity fund 

10 % ... Operating expenses 

6 5% As aid to provinces and 

' cities, excepting the City 
of Manila 



100 



Total 



Whereas before the outbreak of the war, ^^^Tll 
were always given the widest possible publicity now for ie sons ot 
security this Office has deemed it prudent to hide from public know 
ledge major prize winners. Our records however, are open tc per- 
sons of good faith and can show that they have perfect business to 
examine them. The drawing of winning numbers is held in tne pre- 
sence of a Board of Judges made up of prominent persons whose in- 
tegrity are above board, and of radio and press representatives, and 
the general public without distinction.

BATANGAS DIRECTORY 



Out of the proceeds of the Sweepstakes hundreds of welfare and 
charitable organizations have received material aid for their rehabi- 
litation, purchase of equipment and food and medicines for their re- 
spective wards. Thus, out of the 26 draws held since September, 1935 
to December, 1941, P9,221,658.82 and P3,630,437.50 out of the 7 post- 
liberation draws from June 30, 1946 to August 24, 1947, or a total of 
P12,852,096.32, have been distributed as aid to so many charitable and 
welfare institutions. The Philippine Tuberculosis Society alone re- 
ceived Pl,300,000.00 out of the proceeds from post-liberation draws; 
the North General Hospital, P50,000.00; the Maternity and Children's 
Hospital, Manila, P10,000, with other beneficiary institutions like the 
Mandaluyong Emergency Hospital, Health centers of Quezon City, 
Associacion de Damas Filipinas, the Nursing and Traveling Free 
Clinics, Central Luzon Leprosarium and Western Visayas Treatment 
Station and Puericulture Centers included. Other entities that have 
received allotments are Welfareville Institution, Baguio General Hos- 
pital, White Cross, Trinidad Maternity and Children's Hospital, Na- 
tional Federation of Women's Club, Boys Scouts of the Philippines, 
Girls Scouts of the Philippines, National Psychopathic Hospital, Baler 
Maternity Hospital, Asilo de la Milagrosa in Cebu, etc. 

The Sweepstakes has become a popular industry in the country. 
Its profits, if profits they are, for want of a better term, in the form 
of services rendered to the people, are incalculable. As it is tickets 
are being sold like hot cakes. The Pl,500,000 quota for April 27, 1947 
draw was filled up in record time. After filling, the original quota 
for August 24, 1947 draw in 30 days, additional tickets in the amount 
of P312,500 had to be issued, thereby making a total of Pl,812,500. 
In the October 26, 1947 draw the quota of Pl,500,000 plus P500,000 
additional, or a total of P2,000,000, was filled up five weeks before the 
deadline. Consequently, for this draw alone 17,970 additional prizes 
m the amount of P258,067.14 were given out. 

This rapid sale of tickets, and, over areas more extensive, is due 
to the reorganization effected by General Manager Dorado from the 
time he assumed office last January 1. He increased the members 
ot the field force appointed 112 new officials and employees of whom 
4b are field men, and with the approval of the Board of Directors, 
increased the sellers prize 5% of the ticket prize, with bonus of one 
per cent in case the quota is subscribed or exceeded. 

There is perhaps now no event as popular and so widespread in 
the country as the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes. People from the 
northernmost Batanes to the distant Sulu are eager to hear news 
about winning numbers and winners either from the radio, the press

The Philippine Charity Sweepstakes is here to stay. Through 
the money it has raised, it has ameliorated the conditions of the des- 
titute and the unfortunate, of the sick and the infirm, and the disabled 
and the invalid. Orphans and war widows look up to the sweepstakes 
for financial aid and material rehabilitation. Welfare and charitable 
Institutions can only hope to rehabilitate themselves rapidly because 
of material assistance from this source. Sweepstakes money helps 
also in bringing up a virile and strong Filipino manhood and woman- 
hood.

Batangas Forest Resources 

Batangas, like Cebu, is one of the most deforested province of the 
country. Close to one half or 151,860 hectares are in actual cultiva- 
tion. Over 41% or 126,790 hectares are open grass lands. The rest, 
or less than 10% consists of 28,262 hectares of upland forest, of which 
over 6 r /o or 19,241 hectares are non-commercial forest; and 1,670 
hectares are swamps. 

It is generally believed that Batangas was in some remote past 
covered with unbroken forest growth of some kind. As early as 1936, 
the total standing commercial timber amounted to 1,271,393 cubic 
meters or 539 million board feet. Latest records of the Bureau of 
Forestry, however, show: that the commercial forests cover 9,021 
hectares with a total stand of 451,050 cubic meters or 191,235,200 
board feet (gross volume). 

There were in force during the fiscal year 1946-47, one ordinary 
timber license with an allowable cut of 15 cubic meters, capitalized at 
1*300.00 in an area of 80 hectares; one private gratuitous license cov- 
ering 20 cubic meters, for personal use outside communal forests, and 
one public gratuitous license for 1,000 cubic meters for public works. 
A total of 192.90 cubic meters with forest charges and recharges of 
1,081.40 were produced during the fiscal year. These, however, were 
cut without license. 

The Bureau of Forestry has classified as timberland 13,188 hec- 
ares or 4.2% and has released as alienable and disposable 308,582 
hectares or 64%> of the province. There remain to be classified 97,883 
hectares or 31.8% of the entire area of Batangas. In principle, this

AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES 
Act 85 provides the means to promote, develop and rehabilitate the 
agricultural conditions of the province into a state of progressiveness 
as it can be possibly done. The technical personnel rendered technical 
assistance to group as well as individual farmer in making every farm 
produced the most income. The use of improved varieties of crops, 
use of selected seeds and plants, adoption of proper cultural scientific 
procedures, use of proper fertilizer for the crop or crops grown, em- 
ployment of proper irrigation and drainage, conservation of soil through 
contour farming and crop rotation to maintain soil fertility, control of 
plant pests and diseases which are limiting factors in crop production, 
etc., are among the approved methods taught to farmers. 

Batangas in accordance with its geographical and topographical 
conditions is better suited to the growing of fruit trees than to any 
other farm crops, such as rice, corn, sugarcane, vegetables, etc., al- 
though the latter crops may be grown to a certain extent in certain 
sections of the province. 



BATANGAS DIRECTORY

In fruit trees alone, particularly citrus of the varieties of manda- 
rin, such as szinkom, ladu, Batangas, king, etc-, pummelo, oranges, 
others, the province is receiving no less an income of P1,000,000.00 an- 
nually, from the already established commercial orchards according to 
science including all others. Batangas may become the California of 
the Philippines in the future- For the development of the fruit in- 
dustry, the following stations and nurseries are in operation in the 
province, as sources of the best plant materials-

Of notable aspect in our agricultural development is the cultiva- 
tion of deversified crops. Batangas is one if not the sole province 
that practices crop diversification extensively and intensively. Besides 
its lands are practically distributed in equal proportion with slight 
exception among its inhabitants. There is hardly to be found an in- 
dividual farmer that does not own a farm. Every farm family has 
sufficient income to live even not decently but peacefully. Herein 
lies our economic stability.

Important events that occnred in Lipa 
daring the Spanish regime 

By Baldomero B. Reyes 

The oldest settlement; of Lipeiios was in a place called Tagbakin 
somewhere in the southeastern regions of Lake Bombon. This settle- 
ment was teeming with thousands of people with well built houses, 
permanently settled, agricultural life and flourishing commerce when, 
three hundred and fifty years ago, it was first reached by the Agus- 
tihian Missionaries led by Hernando de Cabrera in 1605. 

In 1574, the brave grandson of Legaspi, Salcedo, who was never 
beaten in his speedy exploits in Pampanga, Pangasinan, Cagayan and 
the Ilocos and whom Rizal called the Spanish Cavendish in the Phil- 
ippines, was not able to subdue the Lake Bombon regions because he 
was repulsed by 16,000 strong natives. 

The Oriental Historian H. Otley Beyer makes us believe that the 
old settlement at Tagbakin might have been one of those founded by 
the descendants of the companions of the Bornean Chief Datu Puti 
who in the beginning of the tenth century A. D. came to Lake Bombon 
after having bought the island of Panay from the natives there called 
Atis under the chief Maribodong, with a gold salocot called sadok and 
a gold chain so long that it touched the ground when worn: because 
this historian tells us that those Bornean chiefs and their tribe mixed 
with the natives and their descendants established settlements in all 
directions in southern Luzon as far as Laguna de Bay and the present 
Bicol regions. 

From 1605 to 1702 the old Lipa settlement was not yet a munic- 
ipality. It was merely a missionary site for the propagation of Ca- 
tholicism by the Agustinians under the Alcaldia of Calilaya. 

The rise of the level of the sea due to the eruptions of Taal vol- 
cano caused the people to move the settlement eastward until the site 
of Lumang Lipa became the center. Another eruption of the same 
volcano sank again the settlement there and the people moved to the 
present site of Balete where Lipa was first organized into a munic- 
ipality in 1702 with Geronimo de los Santos as the first gobernador- 

Clll °'ln 3754 Taal Volcano erupted again and covered the town at Ba- 
lete with lava and ashes. The people travelled far to the highlands 
and located the town on the present place. The gobernadorcillo was 
Tomas Hernandez. This was in 1756. 

In 1757 the gobernadorcillo Nicolas Bravo ordered the people to 
gather stones and bricks from the seashore and bring them to the 
land for the building of the first church and tower. 

In 1763 when the head of the town was Francisco Antonio the 
British troops came here to Lipa in pursuit of the Spanish treasure

BATANGAS DIRECTORY 



which came from the Galleon Filipino and which the Spaniards under 
Simon de Anda were hiding and of the wealth of the Spanish treasury 
amounting to 222,0000 escudos under the custody of Nicolas Echaus, 
the treasurer of the Spanish government then. The British succeeded 
in getting here P3,000.00 of the said treasure. They burned the church 
and destroyed the idols, images of the saints. 

In 1782 the tobacco monopoly was first introduced in Lipa under 
the headship of Pascual Gutierrez and the people began to feel the 
hardship of restricting their right to plant, to sell or to smoke the 
tobacco they themselves produced. 

In 1787, the first scaffold for the execution of the outlaws was 
erected in front of the Escuela Pia under the gobernadorcillo Bernabe 
Laguerta. 

In 1796, when Baltazar de Africa was mayor all the young men 
in the villages were caught and conscripted into the Spanish army. 

During the first century of its existence as a municipality, the 
most colorful figure that became gobernadorcillo was one by the name 
of Pablo Maralit. Until now there is a book of legends entitled "Don 
Pablo Maralit" which recounts the adventures and miraculous deeds 
of that man for he was well reputed as possessor of amulets called 
anting anting and aguimats that enabled him to walk on the surface 
of the water and do other wonders. 

During the last century of the Spanish rule over Lipa, from 1800 
to the revolution of 1896, some important events took place in this 
town. 

In 1805, under the mayorship of Leon de Africa famine overtook 
Lipa so much that the price of rice rose to one manicolo (ten centavos) 
a chupa. The poor who could not afford it used to unfold cloths on 
the amorcieo grass that grew by the waysides, idleyards and fields so 
the tiny seeds would stick, be gathered, pounded and the small grains 
boiled soft in plenty of water and swallowed by the people to escape 
from death by hunger. 

In 1808, Galo de los Reyes began the widespread cultivation' of 
the coffee trees by compelling the people to plant the same and thus 
brought about the wealth, splendor and fame that Lipa had after his 
time. 

, In Jf° 9 * he * ronfco astern of fixing the boundaries of the land 
under Felipe Teodoro as mayor was introduced. Previous to that time, 
anyone who could clear the forest was considered owner of his clear- 
ings. 

In 1829, an adventurer from Bauan became gobernadorcillo of 
Lipa. He was Pablo Macarandang who became famous as a poet, 
prophet and medicine man. He could cure various diseases and tell 
the exact moment of the death of anyone he examined though appear- 
ing well and strong.

In 1841 when Galo de Africa was mayor, a comet with long tail 
which the people called sombol appeared and foretold of bad omen. 
This was followed by a revolt in Tayabas which caused death to many 
including women, children and the aged. 

In 1852 when the gobernadorcillo was Pedro Bautista there were 
successive earthquakes so strong that the midnight mass for Christ- 
mas that year was not held. 

In 1858, when the gobernadorcillo was Mateo Katigbac, there 
arrived in Lipa a Spaniard by the name of Gregorio Aguilera who 
collected for the first time the fallas or extra tribute from those peo- 
ple who did not like to work in the public works. Because of his work 
he was called Fallas. 

In 1868 fire burned the southeastern portion of Lipa and in 1869 
another fire burned the entire town together with all the belongings 
and coffee plants of the people in the suburbs. But the people did 
not mind the destruction, because they were wealthy as a consequence 
of the coffee industry. On the ashes they built new houses, bigger 
and more massive, of thicker bricks and stones, galvanized iron im- 
ported from Europe and the best of timber hewn from the mountains. 
The planning, premises, court yards, art, architecture, carvings, 
statutes and decorations were patterned after the mansions and castles 
of the barons and rich people of Europe during the days of the ma- 
norial lords. 

Those were indeed golden days in the glorious history of Lipa. 
During those days of about half a century from the time of Celestino 
Solis in 1843 to the time of Eduardo Mayo in 1890, the gold of Europe 
through Spain and of America through Nueva Espana flowed to 
Lipa. It was at that time in 1887 that Lipa was given the title Villa 
de Lipa by Queen Cristina II of Spain because of the fame of Lipa 
as one of the coffee producing centers of the world. 

Lipa at that time, together with all of its barrios and mountains, 
was filled with coffee plants. During harvest season the main streets 
were filled with hundreds of carts loaded with coffee, being pulled by 
cows and carabaos to the warehouses of the rich where the seeds were 
to be dried on pavements hectares in extensions. 

The Real street of Lipa was like the Escolta of Manila. It was 
lined on both sides by stores, bazaars, and tiendas owned largely by 
Chinese, Hindus and Jews. They sold all things, goods and commo- 
dities imported from Europe, America and Asia. People from the 
neighboring regions came here to make their purchases for then it 
was seldom that they could not buy here anything that they desired 
to have. The seaports of Lipa then were Calamba, Batangas and 
Manila for it was in these places where she brought her coffee to 
be exported to Europe and to Mexico and in the return trip, the hun- 
dreds of carts and horses that brought the coffee grains, brought the 
gold coins and the goods and commodities from these seaports. Dur- 



4 



BATANGAS DIRECTORY 



ing those days many of those that engaged in the planting and trade 
of coffee became fabulously rich and most of the rich families had 
a hundred or more servants each. They took away the molds from 
their gold coins by drying the coins on wide mats in the sunshine on 
the azoteas, yards or roofs of their big houses. During those' days 
paper money was not common and the custom among the people was 
to bring their heavy gold coins in bags loaded on horse backs or in 
carts. 

But the coffee industry which brought paradise to many did not 
last long. A certain kind of fungus known as smuts began to appear, 
sapped the juice of the plant and killed it. In 1888 during the mayor- 
ship of Martin Kison, the colorful procession held to celebrate its 
prosperity proved to be the industry's funeral; for in the year that 
followed in 1889 during the mayorship of Eduardo Mayo, our coffee 
trees began to die, and the industry that had brought wealth, splendor 
and fame to the community was no more. The superstitious, not 
knowing the origin of the death of the plants, assigned the cause to 
the coincidence that beautiful ladies and not the images of saints were 
placed on the beautiful floats that paraded during the celebration. 

In 1882 when Bernardo Solis was the gobernadorcillo, an epide- 
mic known as Asiatic Cholera swept the entire southern Luzon re- 
gions and Lipa became a victim. So mortal was the attack that whole 
households were wiped out in many places and most of the cemeteries 
in the provinces were so filled with dead bodies that the people did 
not have the time to bury them so corpses were filed like sacks of 
coffee one above the other in heaps on the cemeterial grounds. Later 
this was followed by another kind of epidemic called Beriberi and in 
889 by smallpox when vacuna or vaccination was first introduced 
here in Lipa to prevent the spread of that dreaded disease. 

From 1886 to 1887, there came and stayed in Lipa as a student 
and teacher of Don Sebastian Virrey in his college a man who later 
mv 16 S ° Ul ° f the Phili PP ine Revolution. He was Apolinario 
Mabini, the irreconcilable, the sublime and the brains behind Agui- 
naldo. He finished here his Bachelor of Arts degree and the degree 
of Professor of Higher Instructions having finished his secondary 
course in his home town, Tanauan, under another Lipa tutor named 
Valerio Malabanan, a priest. 

In 1889, the reputation of Rizal as a great patriot was already 
well known in Lipa and in 1896 the people revolted and Rodrigo Navas 
the commander of the Spanish garison of 500 Spaniards surrendered 
to the Filipino insurgents under the command of General Eleuterio 
Marasigan on July 10, 1896. 

Of the around two hundred gobernadorcillos that Lipa had during 
the Spanish times, the most important in so far as laying the founda- 
tions of Lipa's prosperity and greatness was concerned, was Galo de 
los Reyes who became gobernadorcillo four times in 1808, 1812, 1822

and 1825; because if he did not have the foresight, the industry, the 
pioneering spirit and the strictness for the planting of the coffee 
plants, Lipa would have been just a mere town like many others with- 
out any name, glamour and golden pages in its past. 

The people that recieved the blessings of his foresight did not fail 
to recognize his importance to the town when for the celebration of 
the industry in 1888 his picture was the only display on the first float 
of the parade. In fact the Lipa people then planned a monument for 
him, the site and corner stones of which were already begun but the 
death of the coffee trees caused the abandonment of the idea. 

Many of the gobernadorcillos or capitanes became famous for their 
good movement, kindness to the poor, justness in their dealings and 
courage and tact in the catching of the outlaws. Such were Celestino 
Solis in 1843, 1848, 1860 and 1861; Juan Malabanan in 1853, Sebas- 
tian Malabanan in 1864, Doroteo de los Reyes in 1871, Simeon Luz in 
1879 and in 1880 and Martin Quizon in 1887 and 1888. 

Many of the gobernadorcillos were great grandfathers of most of 
the prominent families in Lipa today. Don Luis Kalaw of 1821 was 
the grandfather of Valerio Kalaw, first mayor during American times 
and the great grandfather of Teodoro Kalaw famous journalist, par- 
liamentarian, statesman and historian and the political scientist Ma- 
ximo M. Kalaw. Don Sebastian de la Cruz Mayo of 1804 was the son 
of the Irish Captain Ferdinand Mayo who came here with the British 
and from whom Claro Mayo Recto the poet, satirical writer and par- 
liamentarian and the Mayos of today have descended. Don Jose Ka- 
tigbak of 1827 was the great grandfather of the Katigbaks of ^ oda y- 
Don Celestino Solis of 1843 came here from a Barrio of Sto. Toma.< 
as a mere clerk in the municipio whose ascendants were Indios fro ^ 
Malabar who were shipwrecked in Luzon with the ascendants of gen- 
eral Malvar and who by industry, thrift and good luck saved grea 
fortunes and became the owner of the vast landed estates in Lipa, 
Rosario, San Pablo and Dolores that most of the present day wealthy 
families of Solises, Aguileras, Katigbacs and Salases now own. lie 
was the father of Capitang Andong a most glamorous and colortui 
figure of his days. Manuel Rojas of 1857 might have been the tatnei 
of Don Sixto Roxas of 1S67 who in turn was the father of the now 
famous physicians Baldomero and Sixto Roxas and the famous chemist 
Dr Mailing Roxas of today. Don Juan de Silva of 1710 might have 
been the father of Don Patricio de Silva of 1749, of Jose de Silva ol 
1767, of the famous Don Pedro Silva of 1893 who in turn is tne^iainei 
and uncle of the now prominent Silva families in Lipa today. e 
Africas that assumed the mayorship several times in 1777 of Juan <ie 
Africa, in 1796 of Juan S. Africa, in 1805 of Leon de Africa, and in 
1841 of Galo de Africa were surely the great grandparents of the 
numerous Africas. The prominent Luz family that has produced a 
well known writer and businessman Arsenio Luz who is a world figure

surely came from Jose Luz of 1854 and 18GG. The Katigbaks that 
gave to the country the engineer and planner of the Puente de Es- 
pana Petronio Katigbac of 1858, Norberto Katigbac of 1862, Cayetano 
Katigbac of 1865, Lino Katigbac of 1870, and Mariano Katigbac of 
1896. The Dimayuga family that produced some poets and drama- 
tologist in the dialect must have come from Nicolas Dimayuga of 1774, 
Francisco Dimayuga in 1803, Evaristo Dimayuga of 1809, Nicolas Di- 
mayuga of 1813, and Celestino Dimayuga of 1840. The Malabanans 
that gave such famous tutors like Padre Valeriano Malabanan, teacher 
of many famous Batanguenos like Mabini, Sotero Laurel, Diego Gloria 
and others at about the last century of Spanish rule are relatives of 
Sebastian Malabanan of 1863 and 1864. The Manguiats had their 
great great grandparents Ventura Manguiat of 1711 and 1712; the 
Masonsongs, Francisco Masonsong in 1855; the Bautistas, Pedro Bau- 
tista in 1852; the Altamiranos, Alejandro Altamirano in 1859; and the 
Reyeses represent the most numerous of all in the list of gobernador- 
cillos as of the around two hundred terms of that office during the 
Spanish times, that family name assumed the post for nineteen times; 
a number the corresponding names for which are too many to be 
enumerated here. 

But most of the family names of the early town leaders have com- 
pletely become extinct in the Lipa people of today. Such gobernador- 
cillos like Matias Arenas in 1703, Juan Mulingtapang in 1704, Juan 
Gemarra in 1708, Luis Matienzo in 1713, Juan Santonino in 1718, To- 
mas Matira in 1721, Martin Salinas in 1722, Fausto Cruzar in 172G, 
Agustin Quiachon in 1731, Pedro Banaag in 1736, Baltazar Pasig in 
1737, Nicolas Carlos in 1781, Bernabe Laguerta in 1787, Juan San 
Miguel in 1795, Pedro Bernardo in 1817, Felipe Teodoro in 1820, Ma- 
teo Mano in 1849, and Manuel Mando in 1856 do riot now have off- 
springs in Lipa bearing their surnames.
