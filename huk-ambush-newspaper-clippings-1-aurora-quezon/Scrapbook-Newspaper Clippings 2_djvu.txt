Mrs. Quezon wa.s hit in the 
temple and her daughter in the 
chest. Buencamino was wound- 
ed also in the chest. 

Accounts of the ambush said 
^layor Bernardo, at the first 
volley, tried to shout at the at- 
tackers that they were shooting 
ar I'Irs. Quezon. The cry failed 
to stop the splutter of machine- 
gun fire. 

Malacanan said the first offi- 
cial reaction to the attack was 
to ask for the imposition of mar- 
tial law* in Nqeva Ecija. The 
plan was dropped, however, 
when General Ramos informed 
the palace that the disturbance 
had been localized by PC forces. 

^lembers of the funeral ar- 
rangement committee headed by 
Yulo which meets at Malacanan 
this morning are Justice :\Iaiiuel

According to Dr. Qui.sumhing, 
one of the survivors, Mr.^. Que- 
zon was against the plan of hav- 
ing (' »n •;:;j})nKiry e.sc<'rts. It 
was also learned that Philip 
Buencamino refused to go along 
with the party but was prevail- 
ed upon at the last minute. 

Ainbusli Sofie 
Bandits-Ranios 

In all-interview with the As- 
sociated Press last night, Gen- 
eral Alberto Raino.s chief of the 
Constabulary, was quoted us 
saying he did not believe the 
Huks were responsible for the 
killing of Mrs. Quezon. 

He was of the opinion tli:it 
bandits were behind the crime. 
He pointed out two facts w’nich 
lie believed should show that , 
the killing was not dune by '[ 
Huks: first, because the victims j 
were stripped of their valuable.s; ^ 
0 ■ 

(Confiiuied from page 1) 
and second, because Mrs. Que- i 
zon was well known, respected I 
and liked by the Huks. j 

On the other hand, General ' 
Rafael Jalandoni was quoted by 
Malacafian press secretary Bal- 
domcra Olivera in an Interview 
last Eight as having voiced the

Constabularymeu combed the 
area to within u radius of seve- 
ral miles from the place of ani- 
biisli but failed to contact the 
dissidents, reports from Nueva 
Ecija last night stated. 

Shocked over the incident, 
the PC chief lastjaight indicat- 
ed he is motoring to Nueva Eci- 
ja today to lead personally 
what is believed to be the big- 
gest offensive ever to be waged 
i against the dissidents and the 
highway handits in that prov- 
iuce. 

All the remaining tanks at the ; 
PC headquarters and in the 
Southern Luzon Zone Command 
in Balara, Quezon City, were

opinion that the attackers were ; 
Huks. Although Jalandoni said | 
he was not sure if the assailants i 
were Huks or bandits, he was 1 
inclined to believe they were ; 
Huks by the nature of their at- 
tack which was well organized 
and the fact that they were well- 
armed. 

Other sources pointed out 
that the assailants must havo ' 
been Huks because, otherwise, 
they would be unable to roam 
and operate in Huk-controlled 
areas. 

General Ramos said last night 
that he had instructed the PC 
commander in Nueva Ecija to 
converge all avaikable consta- 
bularymen in C a b a n a t n a n 
around the vicinity where Mrs. 
Aurora Quezon and party w^re 
ambushed and to exhaust all ef- 
forts at capturing the ambusli- 
ers. 

The PC chief also said he 
wired Governor Juan O. Chioco 
and all municipal mayors of j

BAGUIO, . April 28 — News of 
the killing of Mrs*, (^lezon. Baby 
Quezon, Mayor Ponciano Bernar- 
do and other members of the 
Quezon party in a Huk ambush 
at Bongabon this iporniiig waa 
a big shock to the re.sidents here, 
amoqg whom the Quezon family 
counted many friends and seve- 
ral relatives. 

A spontaneous expression of 
mourning and great loss was the 
general reaction of city residenfA 
who first received news of bho 
shocking tragedy. 

Mrs. Teodora M. Flores, local 
Red .Cross chapter administrator 
and niece of Mrs. Quezon, and 
Dr. Andres Angara,^ Baguio city 
health officer who was her nef)- 
hew, were both stunned upon be- 
ing' informed of the tragedy.. 
Both could not believe the report 
A similar disbelief was expresa- 
ed by others upon first hearing 
the news. 

Late this afternoon, howeverp 
the Guest House confirmed the 
report of the fatal accident with 

official communication from 
Governor Chioco of Nueva Ecija. 

The news was first received 
here by the Chronicle bureau 
and spread like wildfire. Tho 
Quezons were considered here aa 
re.sidents of Baguio and have ac- 
tively participated in local civic* 
movements. The former first ' 
lady owned a summer residenco 
here including several apartment 
houses and considerable real es- 
tate properties. 

It was recallea.that her year- 
ly Lpurdea novena which she 
used to celebrate at her private 
grotto had become a traditional 
iiesta among the Baguio Catho- 
lics among whom she was consi- ' 
dered a leader. 

I^tayor Bernardo was formerly 
assistant city engineer of Baguio 
from 193d to 1939 and counted, 
among his many friends hero i 
Mrs. Que^n and her family. He ' 
used to spend most of his time 
m Baguio at the Quezon summer » 
house. / 

Dr. Angara and Mrs. Flores 
are flying to Manila tomorrow.-- 


Dona Aurora’s 
Passing 

Special to the Chronicle 
LUCENA, April 28— The peo- 
ple of Quezon province early this 
afternoon received the news of 
Mrs. Quezon’s death skeptically 
at first, but later, confirmation 
by news broadcasts from Mala- 
canan moved the populace to 


grief. 

All families 
are mourning. 


here in Lncena 
Close relatives 
and friends of Mrs. Quezon are 
leaving for Manila this after- 
noon. Governor Gregorio Santa- 
yana, before leaving hurriedly 
for Manila late this afternoon, 
ordered all night clubs, cockpits 
and recreation houses closed 
throughout the W'hole province. 

Governor Santayana issued tho 
following statement: 

“The death of Doha Aurora 
A. Quezon is a very great loss 
to the nation and to the province 
of Quezon for we lost a real be- 
nefactor. Mrs. Quezon in life 
had always done everything, like 
her illustrious husband, for the 
welfare of Tayabas province, 
am sure her surviving childreu 
will be continually loved and res- 
pected by the people of Quezon 
as we loved and respected her 
and her husband.” 

Santayana is Mrs. Quezon’s 
godson. 

Meanw^hile, Mayor Pedro V. 
Guerrero of Baler, Mrs Quezon’s 
nephew, sent a frantic wire ask- 
ing for verification of Mrs. Que- 
zon’s death. Santayana confirm 
ed the news broadcasts. Accord- 
ing to Guerrero, Baler is much 
! -concerned about Mr.s. Quezon’s 
I death, as until five o’clock this 
afternoon, it had not received 
confirmation of the report. The 
Baler people were also worried 
about Dr. Francisco L. Vicuna, 
director of the Quezon Memorial 
hospital, and his wu’fe who were 
with the party of Mrs. Quezon. 

Dr. Vicuna, a Congressional 
aspirant like the late Primitive 
San Agustin, was invited by 
Mrs. Quezon Tuesday afternoon 
to join her party. 

Before leaving, Santayana, 
said a delegation of Quezon offi- 
cials and citizens including all 
municipal mayors will attend the 
necrological services and fune- 
ral of Mrs. Quezon. Former Gov- 
ernors D. Umali and Hilarion 
lanza are also leaving for Ma- 
nila tomorrow morning. The 
Quezon and Marinduque chapters 
and boards of directors of the 
Philippine Red Cross are also 
leaving tomorrow to view the re- 
mains of Mrs. Quezon.

Ha said that he was most con- 
cerned over the repercussions 
tragedy may have in the 


the 


United States aad in other for 
eign countries watching the 
events in the new Republic. 

Kx-Justice Claro M. Recto dec- 
lared : 

“It is a terrible shock to the 
nation and to me personally. 

“Pr^^sident Quirino has assert- 
ed that peace and order have 
been restored and he counted this 
as one of the achievements of 
his administration. It is known 
to everybody that crimes and 
murders are being committed al- 
most daily by dissident elements 
and it is indeed- heart-breaking: 
that W 0 should need this latest 
outrage to open the eyes of the 
people to the utter incompetence 
of this govern men t- 

**President Quirino is so busy 
with his reelection that he does 
not care for more important 
matters of government. He does 
not care how the nation is gov- 
erned. He cannot govern. If thi^ 
were a parliamentary form of 
government, the Quirino admi- 
nistration would have fallen. 


Dr. Salvador Araneta said: 

"Pure and spotless must the 
victim be that the sacrifice may 
he acceptable.” These words of 
Jose Rizal, naturally come to our 
minds in this hour of our nation- 
al bereavement- For Doha Auro- 
ra, a victim of our fratricidal 
hatreds, is indeed a pure and 
spotless martyr . 

"Divine Providence, has will- 
ed to demand from our country 
the mosft precious life of our ci- 
tizenry. Let us hope and pray, 
that this our great loss will serve 
the great purpose of opening the 
eves and touching the hearts of 
all our nationals, that this fra- 
tricidal strif may be put to an 
end. 


Doha Aurora, will be remem- 
bered by many noble deeds, but 
I like to believe that posterity 
will considfer that her appeal to 
the Nation, through the Catho- 
lic Hierarchy, for a month of 
May dedicated to our Lady Me- 
diatrix of all Graces, hallowed 
with prayers and penances, Is 
her spiritual testament to our 
beloved country, and as. such the 
most significant of her • good 


in the altar or our country, her 
appeal acquired a very poignant 
meaning. She had to die a mar- 
tyr of our fratricidal strifes, for 
us to realize that we are facing 
a great national crisis, which de- 
^ mands from all of us, more pra- 
yers, more .penances, and a new 
way of life, if this beloved coun- 
try of ours is to be saved.” 

Leaders and members of the 
lower house of congress last 
night expressed mixed senti- 
ments upon receipt of reports 
of the death -of Mrs. Aurora 
Quezon ranging from shock to 
deep sorrow. 

Congressman Raul Leuterlo 
(Ij-Mindoro) majority floor 
leader, declared; am shock- 
ed beyond words.*' 

Congressman Cipriano Priml- 
clas blamed pronouncements 
made by authorities that peace 
and order were already restored 
in Central Luzon as being res- 
ponsible for Mrs*. Quezon’s 
death. “It Is a great shock to 
the country. I have known Mrs. 
Quezon personally and the 
manner of her death should 
create a feeling of revulsion 
throughout the land,” Prlmlcias 
said. 

Congressman Constancie Pa- 
dilla (DA-Nueva Ecija), repre- 
sentative Of the district that In- 
cludes the hlghway^where Mrs. 
Quezon was ambushed, said: 
“The Incident happened In the ! 
most dangerous and wildest spot 
in Central Luzon. “T do not see 1 
any reason why they ventured 
to pass that way. It would have 
been better if the par?y of jTrs. 
Quezon was unescorted by a PC 
patrol for then they would only 
have been held up and not am- 
bushed for the sole reason that 
Mrs, Quezon was well respected 
even by the Huks.”

Special (o tlie Oiroiiirle . 

Washington, April 2S. — The 
luitiniely death of Mrs. Quezon 
shocked nunieroiis official and 
private individuals who have 
known the Quezon family for 
years. 

The Philippine embassy staff 
could not believe the news until 
it was repeatedly reported from 
official sources. Mrs. Emilio 
Abello declared: 

“Its terrible,' I could not be- 
lieve it, for Mrs. Quezon is loved 
by all; irrespective of political 
(Coiitimu'd oil )>age 34, Col, 7) 
iviaiiira auer jr/isuieuL v,;uezuu a 
death,, she has been very activo 
in all social work specially v/ith I 
the Philippine Red Cross which 
she served creditably. Her cie-ath . 
is a distinct loss to the Philip- 
pines and mourned by all who 
: know her great work.” 

I Mrs. Harry Hawes, when noti- 
fied by the Chronicle, was dumb 
founded, then said: “Oh, no! I 
. am absolutely shocked. Mrs. Qua- 
I zou has always been kind, sweet 
and helf^ful. Please .convey my 
condolence to President Quirino, 
the children and the Filiprno 
people.” 

It was recalled that while Mrs. 
Quezon was here with the exifa I 
government, she organized Phil- j 
Ippine women’s club and took 
active part In organizing various 
Filipino communities through- j 
out the United States, collecting • 
clothing and medicine for the 
Philippines.

All the occupants of the cir 
except General Jaiandoni, were 
iiL by the fusiiade and kiilel. 
dalandoni related how the car 
stopped dead and how he wenc 
tor his revolver as he" saw a 
ftroup of Pluks approaching. Be- 
fore he could slioot, he wa.^ 
struck on the face with a rifle 
butt by one of the assailants, lie 


Iost: consciousnesa and was ap 
parently given up for dead by 
tbs Huks. 

Dr, Luis Alandy, personal sec- i 
retary of Mrs. Quezon gave a 1. 
more coherent account of the j;’ 
ambuscade. Ha was In the < 
fourth, car and was able to turn {' 
back while the attackers were ; 
concentrating their attention on 
tbe first three cars. 

Alandy said the assailants ; 
fired at close range with ma- i 
china guns. Instantly killing all ! 
tbe occupants of the first three 
vehicles. Machine guns raked 
the Buick in which the Quezons 
following. In the second jeep 
were Col. Primitivo San Agustia 
with five PC escorts. 

The PC escort was unable to 
fire a single shot, so sudden was 
the attack. 

General Jalandonl said that 
when he recovered cons- 
ciousness, all the Huks a 
gone. He looked around and saw , 
that all the occupaats “ 

car and jeep were tL bo^ 1 
or seriously wounded. Ibe bo-i 
dies had been striped ot valua- 
bles. Pedro Payurno. a Maiaca- 


zon, were all left on the sr.eue 
of the ambush as they were all ' 
ridded with machine gun bul- 
lets, including the yital parts 
of the machiues- 

The bodies of the victims 
were rushed to the provincial 
hospital ill a station wagon and 
an army ambulance. The bodies 
of Mrs. Quezon and her daugh- 
ter Baby were placed inside the 
statiou wagon, while those of 
the two Sun Agustin brpther.s 
and driver Molina were tucked 
on the rear compartment with 
their feet sticking out to the 
rear. 

The exposed dead bodies at- 
tracted immediate attention as 
the vehicles rushed through 
this town. The news of the tra- 
gedy spread like wildfire to the 
aghast populace. 

All the bodies could not be 
recognized with thick dust 
^hicli enveloped the faces and 
exposed parts. It was believed 
that the ambush perpetrators 
dragged the victims on the 
ground after they were killed. 

It was learned here that the 
vi^it of Dona Aurora to Baler 
was known here one week in 
advance as workers ot the bu- 
reau of public works had been 
clearing the road for five days 
now. This gave the Huks ad- 
vance knowledge of the trip. 

All the three death vehicles 
were left at the scene of the 
ambush. They were riddled with 
bullets. 

Governor Cliioco was deeply 
touched by the ambush, which 
he called a national tragedy. 
He said that there is no luore 
reasom for President Quirino 
and PC ' officers to insist that 
there is peace in Nueva Ecija. 
He added that the government 
should concentrate all the gov- 
ernment’s available forces here 
and punish the killers of Mrs.

ill the hope of catching a glimpse 
of the bodies ofAlieir beloved 
Mrs. Aurora Aragon Quezon 
and her daughter “Bab.v.’’ The 
sad news of their deatlis had 
spread with such rapidity and 
had so electrified Manilans that 
by 7:30 the doorway of the fune- 
ral parlor had become almost 
Impassable. 

People from all walks of life 
came and went for hours on

As soon as the seven caskets 
j bearing the bodies arrived, they 
I were immediately rushed to 
the morgue behind the parlor 
and guards barred the curious 
from its doors. Observers went 
home disappointed. A great 
number, however, had the satis- 
faction of hearing from several 
survivors the tragic tale of tlie 
incident. Although there were 
many varying versions of it, 
they were essentially the same.’ 
According to Francisco Mar- 
quez, administrative officer of 
the department of agriculture, 
a shower of bullets announced 
the impending disaster. He was 
riding in the seventh car from 
Mrs. Quezon’s. After the party 
had reached the boundary sepa- 
rating Quezon. and Nueva Ecija, 
they heard a volley of shots and 
a PC courier came rushing to 
their. j\irs. Quezon iiaha- 

rang” he breatiilessly aunoauced 
to them. This was between 
10.. 3 0 and 11 o’clock yesterda.v

(Bulletin Corrctpondenl) 


CABANATUAN, Nueva Ecija, 
April ^8. — This morning’s atro- 
cious Huk ambuscade — slajing ol 
Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon, her 
daughter Maria Aurora (Baby) 
Quezon and son-in-law Philip 
Buencamino III and several 
others came on the heels of the 
first peace and order conference 
of Governor Juan Chioco and 
other officials of this province, 
with the new PC commander, Lt. 
Col. Angel Magallanes, who re- 
lieved Col. Demetrio Camua two 
days ago. 

In this conference, every one 
clamored for tJie immediate "resto- 
ration of peace and order in the 
province as the rainy season is 
not far off and more than half of 
the 400 barrios of Nueva Ecija 
have been abandoned by tenants. 
The farmers refuse to ' return to 
the barrios without adequate gov- 
ernment protection. 

Col. Magallanes pledged to do 
his best but appealed for coopera- ' 
tion of the officials and the peo- 
ple. 

Governor Chioco told the con- 
ference the Huk problem was* 
‘’worse than the Hibokhibok erup- 
tion where the government spent 
much attention and. money." He 


emphasized \)m\ the situation was I 
e.»plosi\e. He .said he was read\' ! 
to go out in the f.eld with tlic : 
Sovornroont forces in a drive ' 
against the Huks. If ncccs'^arv I 
he said, he would organize 5,0(56 i 
former guerrillas to participate 
m the campaign provided the gov- i 
ernment supplied them with aims * 
Board Member Si.xto Lustre 
said the people were not cooperat- 
ing because they have no faith in 
the government that failed to give ‘ 
them true justice and protection.*' 
He said they were afraid to re- 
port the Huk movement because 
the government could not give | 
them adequate protection in the! 
event of Huk reprisals. i 


SO LONS HEAR OF AMBUSCADE. Congressman Tomas Mora to 
(right) tells congressmen about the brutal slaying of Mrs. Quezon 
and members of lier party. Reaction in the halls of congress was 
violent, and included a move for total war against the outlaws.

Huk' Ambush Brings To Tragic End 
Airs, Quezon* s Acts For People* s Good 


Mrs. Aurora Aragon Quezon ( 
was born on Feb. 19, 1888 in Ba- 1; 
ler, Tayabas (now (Quezon prov- j 
ince). Her parents were Pedro 
Aragon and Zeneida Molina. She 
attended the -parochial school of 
the town until she was 15 when 
her cousin, Manuel L. Quezon ac- 
companied her to Manila to stu- 
dy. She enrolled in the Philippine 
Normal School on Taft Avenue 
1 and finished the teacher’s course. 

, Opposition to the marriage of 
i Aurora to Manuel was put up by 
Mrs. Quezon’s mother, a sister of 
Quezon’s mother. A year after the j 
death of Manuel’s Aunt Zeneida, j 
on Dee. 14, 1918, the Quezons were i 
married in a quiet ceremony held 
in Hongkong. 

In Quezon’s memoirs, The Good 
Fight, the late President summed 
up his life with Aurora as “twen- 
ty-four years of married life with 


the same wife have proved that 
matrimonial happiness does not 
depend upon the noise of the wed- 
« ding. Nor for that matter upon 
^ closing one’s eyes to the sight of 
other beauties and running away 
from their company during one’s 
engagement,” , 

Four children were born to the I 
Ou ezons — Maria Aurora ( Baby ) , » 
Maria Zeneida (Nini), Pacita (who 
died at the age of 10 months), and 
Manuel Jr., (Nonong). 

Mrs. Quezon always gave a rea- 
dy ear to the people who solicited 
Her help and support, especially 
xx/hen it concerned charity and the 
General welfare of the community, 
^hc lent her name and prestige 
various woman organizations 
hv accepting posts as honorary 
^r-esident or chairman. At the tune 
her death she was honorary 
President of the Catholic Women’s 
r Jkcrue, Club de Damas de Manila 
H the Young Ladies Association 
of which her daughter, 
Babj^ was president of the coun- 

was closely associated with 
reii^ous activities and worked 


Maria Aurora (Baby) Quezon 
was born on Sept. 23, 1919. She 
studied at St. Theresa’s College 
with her sister, Nini, up to the 
seventh grade. Later they went 
to the Assumption Convent of 
Manila where both finished high 
school. In the University of San- 
to Tomas, alma mater of her fa- 
ther, Baby took up bachelor of 
arts then the study of law. She 
pass the bar examinations last . 
year. 

In life Baby contributed her bit 
to society and charity, acting as 
chairman of ladies’ committees in 
soliciting aid for various clubs. 
She was closely identified with the 
Volunteer Social Aid (Committee 
of which Miss Lourdes Alunan is 
now president. She assisted the 
group in raising money for the 
veterans and giving them cheer 
during the years following liber- 
ation. She was a close adherent 
of the Girl Scouts movement in 
the Islands. But most of her time 
was taken up by the Young Ladies 
of Charity which she helped to 
found. A total of 142 schools scat- 
tered ail over the country under 
the sponsorship of the YLAC takes

A People In Sorrow 


A people cowers In sorrow todoy. 

Never before In remembered history has this people suf- 
fered such a blow. 

The most revered woman In the land, her daughter, ten 
others, were massacred, while traveling on a public road. 

These are the facts. 

They cannot bo explained, they cannot be excused, they 
cannot be rotlonallied. . 

The killers knew whom they were killing. All the evi- 
dence points that way. They were told. Yet they killed. 

It Is fotuouf to make distinctions. It If' fatuous to say 
that the killers wore this and that, and not that and this. 

The simple fact stares out, that this was premeditated 
attack, carefully orranped to brinn the maximum of aHackIng 
force on the prey which the ottackors knew was going to be 
at a certain pinco at a certain time. 

Dno. Aurora Aragon de Quezon, the widow of Manuel 
L. Queion, wos murdered. The quiet, shining lamp that held 
before the people the memory of that flaming light of free- 
defi that woi Quezon, was murdered. 

Aurora Quezon, that bright, sparkling flash that was 
such o vivid reflection of a world^great father, was murdered. 

Ten other Innocent people were murdered. 

And a people cowers In sorrow — and waits — for 
more murdors?

Cabinet meetings and other ap-

this ambush was by Huks. If they 
knew before hand that it was Mrs.

harm her because the Huks like 
Mrs. Quezon. To me it is pure 
banditry and the whole country is 
enraged because of this incident. 1

Capt. Constante Cruz, press rela- 
tions officer of the Philippine Con- 
stabulary, late yesterday afternoon 
told the Manila Times that a PC 
force headed by Capt. Burgosmo 
Fausto rushed to the scene of the 
ambuscade upon receipt of the 
news and combed the area for the 
dissidents. 

Contact was established in the 
afternoon and a “fire fight’ was 
in progress at 5:30 p.m., according 
to the PC spokesman. Xo further 
details about the encounter were 
available. 

Special to The !MAXILA TBlEs 

CABANATUAX, April 82.— The 
people here received the news of 
the ambuscade with bitternes 
and hatred as reports were cir- 
culated bv Dr, Jesus Salumbides, 
chief of “ the local Red Cross 
chapter, that Mayor Ponciano A. 
Bernardo of Quezon City, a na- 
tive of Xu€va Ecija, was cut down 
merdlessly by the dissidents while 
he was pleading with them to 
stop firing. 

He told the dissidents the car 
was carrying Mrs. Quezon. The 
dissidents" centered the fire on 
Mrs. Quezon’s car. 

People from Santa Rosa where 
Mayor Bernardo was borij could 
not believe the story of the am- 
buscade. 

Residents lined the streets as 
the vehicles carrying the bodies 
of the victims bound for Manila 
passed. Many of the people were 
moved to tears. 

Dr. Salumbides received the 
account of the attack.

President Quezon was born. Thej^i 
were to remain in Baler until 
May 2, to attend the second an- 
nh^ersary of the church which^ 
was built with the money of Mrs.’ 
Quezon. 

Mrs. Josefina Martinez Bernar-; 
do, widow of Mayor Bernardo, of 
Quezon City received ^the news of 
the death of her husband at 4:00 
p.m, yesterday while she was in; 

^the familj'' residence at Mataba 
St.. Cubao. Quezon City. 

She could not at first believe 
that hej’ husband was dead, but. 
when a second call from a friend 
was received in the house, she 
burst into tears and closetted her- 
self in the room. 

Ma}’or Bernardo left eight child- 
ren. the eldest, Carolina, and the 
other in order of their ages were: 
Josefina. Ponciano, Jr., Emmanuel. 

Juliet, Reynaldo, Maria Aurora 
and Cherry. 

The first to relate to the press 
a factual account of the bloody am- 
buscade was Teodolo Villadelgado, 
chauffeur of Mrs. Quezon who 
drove the fourth car (jeep) in the 
party. 

One of the few known survivors 
of the massacre, Villadelgado was 
driving Mrs. Quezon's jeep bearing 
plate No. 7470, with two members 
of the party he could not identify. 

He said Mrs. Quezon was in a 
car (Mayor Bernardo’s) which was 
at the head of the column, follow- 
ed bv three jeeps. Villadelgado's 
jeep was the fourth in the column 
and right behind the jeep where 
Col. Primitive San Agustin who 
was being driven by another chau- 
ffeur. 

The two members of the party j 
who rode in Villadelgado’s jeep> 
were killed. After his miraculous | 
escape from the ambuscade, the! 
driver turned back his bullet-ridden i 
jeep to Cabanatuan. He left Caba-; 
natuan at 4:10 p.m. and arrived ati 
Malacahan at 7:30 in the evening. . 

Villadelgado, who is known as* 
Master Xonong Quezon’s driver, re-j 
ported to Secretary Evangelista f 
upon arrival at, Malacahan. His[ 
khaki pants and shirts were stain- j 
ed with blood, w'hich he said must 
have come from his passengers | 
who were killed. 

Looking pale' and haggard after 
his terrifying experience. Villadel- 
gado was taken to the Malacahan 
garage and given a cup of hot cof- 
fee. While taking his coffee, he 
managed to^ answer a barrage of 
questions which a crowd of re-( 
porters and onlookers directed att 
him. Here’s his story. J 

“I remember we were driving| 
near kilometer 168 (from Manila) 
when we were attacked. The roadl 
was winding up. Without any! 
warping, I heard machine gun firel 
from the top of an incline overlook-' 
Ing us and from all around us. 

“The first casualty I saw was Col. 
Primitivo San Agustin who was In

l! Congressman Cornelio T. Yilla-

ies — “The death of Mrs. Quezon is a 
i great loss to the nation. The Huks

Congressman Amado Yuzon (DA, 


Dr. Salvador Araneta Issued the 
following statement last nlg^--- 

“Pure and spotless mu:=t the v* 
tim be that the sacrifice y® 
acceptable.” These words of Jos^ 
Rizal. naturally come to om iftmds 
in this hour of our national betfy ^ 
mem. For Dona Aurora, a victim 
of our fractricidal hatreds, is indeed 
a pure and spotless martyr. 

Divine Providence has willed to 
demand from our country the most 
precious life of our citizenry. Let 
us hope and pray, that this our 
great loss will serve the great pur- 
pose of opening the eyes and touch- 
ing the hearts of all our nationals, 
that this fractricidal strife may be 
put to an end. 

Dona Aurora, will be remember- 
ed by many noble deeds, but I like 
to believe that our posterity will 
consider that her appeal to the Na- 
tion. through the Catholic Hierar- 
chv, for a month of May dedicated 
to our Ladv Mediatrix of all Graces, 
hallowed with prayers and penan- 
ces, is her spiritual testament to 
one beloved country, and as such 
the most significant of her good 
deeds. 

With the sacrifice of her life in 
the altar of our country, her ap- 
peal acquired a very poignant 
meaning. She had to die a martyr 
of our fractricidal strifes, for us 
to realize that we are facing a great 
; national crisis, which demands 
from all of us. more prayers, more 
penances, and a new wa\* of life, 
if this our beloved country of ours 
is to be saved.

Rush To Give Blood 
To Mossacre Victims 


SpociaJ to The MAA'ILA TI.MK3 

MALOLOS. Bulacan, April 2S. — 
TJie radio flash regarding the am.- 
buscade of Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon 
and party resulting to her death 
and Mayor Bernardo of* Quezon City 
and. eight others was received with 
surprise and anger against dissi- 
dents. 


Special to The MANILA TIME.'l 

LUCENA, Quezon, April 2S— This 
province to a man today mourned 
the death of Mrs. Aurora Aragon 
Quezon, widow of the late Pres- 
ident Quezon, at the hands of as- 
sassins on the Nueva Eeija-Quezon 
border. 

Shocked beyond belief, towns- 
people heard the news of tbs am- 
buscade on the road to Baler from 
their radios. The news struck lis- 
teners speechless. 

Mayor Pedro Y. Guerrero of Ba- 
ler. a' nephew of Mrs. Quezon, wired 
Governor Gregorio Santayana for 
'confirmation and was told that 
Mrs. Quezon, Baby, and Philip 
Buencamino HI died In the ambush. 

Governor Santayana hurried to 
Manila this afternoon. Before 
leaving he issued the following 
statement: 

“The death of Dona Aurora .A. 
Quezon is a very great loss to the 
nation and to the province of Que- 
zon. for we lost a benefactor. Airs. 
Quezon in life had alwa^^s done 
everything like her , illustrious hus- 
band. for the welfare of Tavabas 
provincp. I am sure her surviving 
-ni ; 


Up to 10 o’clock last night more 
than 200 persons of all nationali- 
ties, with Filipinos and Americans 
predominating, had presen I edH.hem- 
selves at Philippine Red Cross head- 
quarters and offered to give their 
blood In response to a radio appeal 
which had lieen broadcast shortly 
before 5 p.m. yesterday. 

At 4:ao p.m. the Red Cross Avas 
able to dispatch a Philippine Anpy 
plane to Cahanaiuan bringing Avilh 
it 20,000 cubic centimeters of plas- 
ma and 5,000 cubic centimeters of 
fresh blood. 

Although many offered to give 
blood, a considerable number Avas 
rejected due tef the fact that Avhat 
Avas de.<;ired was only Type 0 blood, 
the universal type. Of the total 
number of persons Avho Avere exa- 
mined Red Cros.s doctors, only 
about 50 had been accepted up to 
shortly before 10 o’clock last .night. 

To Francisco Ortigas. Jr. belongs 
the honor of being the first success- 
ful donor of Type 0 blood. 

^ Red Cross headquarters Avas busy 
practically all night last night. All 
emploj^es, Including doctors and 
nurses, AA^re at their posts. Mean-

CABANATUAN, April 2P — 
Over 2.000 civiliau guards and 
■ipecial policeman iu this prov- 
ince, totally aroused by the hei- 
nous ambuscade of the Quezon 
party at the Nueva Ecija-Qiie- 
zon border, are now voluntarily 
offering their services with gov- 
ernment forces in tracking down 
the culprits. 

This offer is being studied by 
Lt. Col. Angel Magallaues who, 
since y9.st.erda7 afternoon, has 
thrown Into the pursuit of the 
attackers all avail^b’ ' goveru- 
ruent forces. 1,1. Col, Napoleon 
Valeriano, hts 

cer, was on the move with his 
famous Nenita Unit barely two 
hours after tlie ambuscade. 

Sev'T-al PA and PC ronipa- 
nles may also be sent here with-

The decisiori of President 
Quirino and the army liigh com- 
mand to launch an immediate 
Joint PC and PA operation.^ ag- 
ainsc the atf u.dcers was bailed 
throughout the province as tli'» 
only wdv to curb Hi ? rising tide 
of Huk aml)usc.i los. 


■'it is genM-ally con.-o/led rhat 
the prcs.-;nr government force'i 
here are not enough to ferret 
out the Huks from their mount- 
ain lairs, even with the use of 
planes and heavy guns. What is 
needed, th<3y believe, is a suf- 
ficient combat force which is 
capable of taking the field ag- 
ainst the Huks night and day 
without withdrawal. 

This combat force should go 
after the dis.sideuts even to the 
heart of tl»e Sierra Madre, esta- 
blish cordons around them, 
starve or blast them with mor- 
tars and bonibs. 

While this force is pursuing 
the links relentlessly, strong 
garrisons should guard the bar- 
rfo.s with a 2 l-hour patrol on 
threatened higtiways. P’resh 
troops should always be fa re- 
serve in strategic points in the 
r**ovince. 

The Huks are believed very 
elusive in the Sierra Madra 
wilds which they use iu their 
frequent raids against defense- 
less barrios and towns. — GAG

“It is a most regrettable In-

death of such a distinguished

men have lost a leader and 
champion.” 

Senator Avelino: : 

“I am profoundly shocked 
and grieved by the fate of Mrs. 
Quezon, her beloved daughter, 
and the other members of their 
party. Dona Aurora was a 
great Filipiua in her own right.

she shared struggle, victory and 
exile, she could ^Ightly be call-

our Republic.

less struggle for the betterment 
of our jieople. Only Divine 
Providence can ever adequately 
explaiiF to a sorrowing nation 
the infinite wisdom behind 
such supreme sacrifice sudden- 
ly exacted from heroes who had 
already given too much to a 
grateful people. 

“But their death will not be 
In vain. Our aroused citizenry 
coming out from the. painful 
spell of the shock will exact 
justice from the guilty and con- 
demn with righteous' wrath 
those in our present admihistra- 
tiou who with foul stu-pidlty and 
tlirougli deceitful negligence 
have sought to dupe t)ie people 
wltli the claim that lawlessness 
is gone, that peace and order 
fiov^ exist.* Such is the price. of 
mob callousness and personal ; 
greed for power— the lives of ' 
good, honest citizens.” 

The Board of Directors of the 
Philippine Tuberculosis .Society 
mourned deeply the sudden and 
violent death of Dona Aurora 
A. Quezon and expressed its sin^ 
cere sympathy and condolence 
to the bereaved family for this 
great and irreparable loss to 
them, to the nation and to the

“Her death at the hands of

Is not only a national tragedy . 
but a natioral shame. In ex- 
pressing my deepest and sincer- 1 
est sorrow on her passing, I call 
also for the most "prompt and 
effective measures to bring her 
murderers to justice.’’ 

Ex-Justice Claro M. Recto de- 
clared: 


“It is a terrible shock to the 
nation and to me personally, 
“President Quirino has a.sser- 
ted that peace and »rder have 
been restored and he counted 
•this as one of the achievements 
of his administration. It Is 
kdown to every body that crlniea- 
and murders are being commit- 
ted daily by dissident elements 
and it is indeed heart-breaking

Today, Mrs. Aurora A. Que- 
zon carries on her work, wdb 
unabated zeal, as head of the 
Philippine National Red Cro.ss, 
working as volunteer chairman 
of the PNRC’s Board of Gov- 
ernors and Executive Commit- 
tee 

As chairman of the two rteer- 
ing committees which direct the 
destinies Of this organization, 
whose work involves the tremen- 
dous task of bringing relief to 
a nation in times of emergency, 
as well as looking after its wel- 
fare from day to day, Mrs. Que- 
zon has taken up a challenge 
that is the more ardous because, 
like her late husband, she has 
a trail-blazing work to do, with 
no set 4 nd approved pattern to 
follow. , Add to this the grip 
of unresV of difficult times 
brought doout by a 'destructive 
war, faced by an uncertain fu- 
ture, and we could appreciate 
the enormity of her job. 

Mrs. Quezon’s duties, as chair- 
man of the Philippine National 
Red Cross, are comparable to 
the duties of the president of 
an organization or a corporation, 
i She calls and presides at all 
I meetings q# the Board of Gov-

head of the organization, under

committees created by the 
Board of Governors, or Execu- 
tive Committee, she Is empow- 
ered to take steps to meet the 
situation as to her seem advis- 
able and necessary. 

That, In brief, describes the 
duties of' the office filled by 
Mrs. Quezon. It does not des- 
cribe the tact, the energy, the 
worries, the intricate human an- 
gles involved in such work as 
she has, which, in the main, 
deal with people. 

Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon was 
the daughter of the Aragona. an 
old and respected family of Ta- 


(Reprinled from the Philcross Magazine, May, 1948 issue) 

For almost three decades, Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon, widow 
of the first president of the Philippine Commonwealth, Manuel , 
L. Quezon, had continuously lived in the public eye, sharing the i 
limelight with her illustrious husband, not only as the wife of one 
of the greatest men in her country’s history, but, also, on her 
own, as one of the most devoted and indefatigable social workers 
of the Philippines. 

yabas. She was born in Baler, 
of that province on February 19, 
1888. As a young girl, she went 
to Catholic schools, which were, 
then, the public schools attend- 
ed by most of the young people 
of her day. Reared in the best 
Filipino and Spanish traditions 
she led a sheltered life until 
she met and married dynamise 
Manuel L. Quezon. Marriage 
made her forego her early .iro- 
bition to become a teacher, fori 
which she .studied in the old 
Philippine Normal SchooL 

Marriage to Manuel Quezon 
was a great change in Aurora 1 
Aragon’s life. She suddenly 
found her^lf in the public eye, 
caught in the tide of history, 
which her husband was making. 

It was at this time, that Mrs. j 
Quezon laid the foundations of j 
her welfare work, which enrich- j 
ed her life, deepening her un- 
derstanding of people, and giv- 
ing her an end and aim. which, 
in later years filled in the 
blank spaces in her life as a re- 
sult of war and the death of 
her beloved husband. 

During the war years, in the 
loneliness of exile in the United 
States, she found refuge from 
her worries about the homeland, 
in volunteer work for the Ame- j 
risan Red Cross. Her children j 
Maria Aurora, Zenaida, and I 
Manuel Jr., were' in the volun- ' 
teer blood donor service of the 
Red Cross, and also did nursing, 
canteen work, and their share 
of war production. When peace 
came again, she returned to the 
Philippines, her head bowed a lit- 
tle, but with a stout determina- 
tion to carry on her life, in the 
most useful way possible. To- 
day, still energetic and except 
for her silver-gray hair, lightly 
touched by the years, Mrs. Que- 
zon had forsaken a well-earned 
retirement to devote her un- 
flogging enthusiasm to welfare 
work as chairman of the Phil- 
ippine National Red Cross, 
whdse cause, aid to suffeiwg 
humanity, is her cause.

REQUIEM MASS 
FOR MRS. QUEZON 

(Special to the Bulletin) 
ILAGAN, Isabela, May 1. — A* 
requiem mass was celebrated in 
the Catholic church of Hagan this 
morning in honor of the late Mrs. 
Aurora A. Quezon- 
The mass was offered by mem- 
bers of the local Red Cross' chap- 
ter and the local Catholic Wom- 
en's League. Among those who at- 
tended the mass were Secretary 
Cornelio Balmaceda, Governor Sil-

cials headed by Manager Formo- 


Thousands of people from Que-i 
zon City, Manila and neighboring j 
provinces led by ranking govern- 
ment officials of the Republic and 
high officers of the United States 
army paid their last tribute to 
former QC Mayor Ponciano A. 
Bernardo yesterday. 

Mayor Bernardo, one of the vic- 
tims in the ambush of Mrs. Que- 
zon’s party by Huks on the Nueva 
Ecija-Quezoii boundary, was laid 
to rest in the North cemetery 
at 12:25 p. m. 

Eight speakers took turns in 
eulogizing the late Quezon City 
executive during the two-hour 
necrological services held at tlie 
new city hall along Highway 54. 
Among the speakers were Jpoo- 
gressman' Tomas B. Morato of the 
second district of Quezon province; 
Juan M. Arellano, chairman of 
the capital city planning com- 
mission; former Justice Manuel 
Lim, chainnan of the Philippine

Undersecretary Roque said 
Mayor Bernardo was a "builder 
and a leader.” He declared that 
his name would always be asso- 
ciated with various improvements 
in Quezon City which, according 
to Roque, was undertaken by Ber-

millions. It was ineonceivahle that ; 
any violence could come to her. : 
It was the last thing that law- !

could expect to happen to her. ; 

Yet, it happened. Outlawry ran i

they were weiiding their peaceful

[ J for 



that outlawiy be quelled, that 
murderers be caught and ade- 
quately punished. This order is ‘ 
a natural desire of peace-loving 
peoples. They want to go about ; 
their daily pursuits without the 
spectre of death hovering alVvays ' 
near. They want to feel, that no 
matter whether it is in broad day- ! 
light of the noonday sun, or 
blackest midnight, they can travel 1 
from place to place, or rest in \ 
their homes, without raiders com- 
ing to kill and to rob. 

Every decent citizen hopes that 
in the wake of this fearful trage- -ra 
dy, a new day will dawn when the o 
pursuit of happiness will never be 
disturbed. Every decent citizen j 
hopes that the authorities will not lief 
slaken their efforts, will not pause 
or turn backward, until banditry, 
outlawry and cold, caleiilated ; 
murder are eradicated from this 
fair land. 

The liistory of the world is filled 
with instances of where, out of 
the depths of tragedy, greu a bet- 
ter order of things. No power on . 
earth can restore to earth the , 
warm, quiet iiresence of Doiia • 
Aurora Quezon and her daughter j 
and friends. But if the outraged | 
citizens of this republic rise and ' 
demand that, in the wake of this 
tragedy, the lawless elements be 
wiped out, we feel that Doha • 
Aurora Quezon will he a happier 
woman in that “bourne from j 
wiiieh no traMder has ever re- )

April 29, 1949 

Dear Editor: 

In the lamentable incident 
of yesterday, there was one 
phase which was not touched 
upon in the papers — de- 
tails of the precautions tak- 
en to prevent the incident. 

Was there no patrol dis- 
patched one hour ahead of 
the party? 

Are there regular patrols 
in the Bongabong-Baler high- 
way? 

Considering the activities 
of the Huks in this area and 
the passing of a distinguish- 
ed party, some precautions 
must have been taken, and 
these were not apparently 
checked upon.

The Editor 

The Evening Chronicle 
Sir: 

In today’s issue of the 
Evening Chronicle there is 
attributed to me a supposed 
statement that ‘T will quit 
my post as Mayor if not giv- 
en a working majority in the 
municipal board”, w’hich ac- 


cording to the same paper 
was told by me to President 
Quirino in a long distance 
telephone conversation. 

I deny the statement be- 
cause I never made it I 
welcome all fights which my 
detractors desire to provoke. 
If there is no working ma- 
jority in the municipal board 
to push thru administration 
projects, this lamentable fact 
could be traced to the hos- 
tile actuations of some mem- 
bers of the board whom I 
have displeased on certain 
matters which I believe run 
counter to the enunciated 
policies of the Liberal party. 

The present administra- 
tion (liberal) has done a 
substantial improvement in 
the city as I have reported 
last December 31, 1948, aqd 
which all the papers publish- 
ed, specially the Bulletin in 
its anniversary issue. 

In closing I want the pub- 
lic to know that I will stick 
to my job as long as the 
President has not lost his 
confidence in me. 

Very respectfully, 
MANUEL DE LA FUENTE 

Mayor, City of Manila 


Sincerely yoursi 


Gi Rivera, 


Let 118 recall on old apho- 
rism — one must pay dearly 
for one’s mo.st coveted db- . 
sire. ^ 

The price, always com- 
pounded of heartache, and an- 
guish and tears, leaves a deep 
wound In the soul. 

But since the fulfillment 
of desire Is a categorical im- 
perative price must be 
paid. 

Good men and ivomen still 
In tears inconsolably ask 
themselves: but why should 
the price of peace at home bia 

^''Iv the blood of her who 

embodied the emblem of heir 
people? 

Becau^ tlie liighest good 
exacts the highest price. 

Where men in authority, 
abetted by their cohorts have, 
by nl^levoi^>nt designs and de- 
reliction, fostered the prosU- 
tiition of official power, and 
by loose Indulgence in vena- 
lity have encouraged th^ di- 
sintegration of social order 
and sparked Bie growth of a 
can c e rous misgovemment, 
Bathala splits an atom and 
sets a conflagration. 

It Is mayhap In the divine 
plan that tli^ most revered 
woman In this Republic re 
presenUng tho noblest charac- 
ter of our people, should be 
Immolated in the lire 


J 


Veriiy the hlood Y 1^6^^ 
Aurora together with 
countless victims of the 
lers of the mountain Is 
price that we pay In full ahijl 
in advance for th^ coveted 
peace at home, w’here glut> 
tons for personal power anA 
lucre have apiiropriated an<l 
squandered what should have 
been th^ cost of tho common* 
weal. { 

Yet by spilling her blood In 
the coiinti*yslde, Dofia Auro- 
ra, true to her name, ultimate* 
ly accelerated tho break of 
dawTi, thus lighting the way 
towards tho redemption of 
her people from tho crueltied 
of tlie dark niglit that has en- 
gulfed them for so long. 

It is not odd that people 
^ould ask wily, and seek tlie 
aght answer. For it is in the 
CdYrect answer tliat they will 
find tlicir bearing for proper 
action. 

But wliatever the answer, a 
wanton evil is on the ram- 
page. 

This evil Is absolute. And 
absolutism can ho defeated 
only by stronger absolutism- 

No cause hoivever holy, 
however divhf^ can win with- 
out fire power support. 

Slogans lielp. Kiit wiiere 
lorce is the argument, slogans 
uo not convince.

Brig. Gen. Alberto Ramos, chief 
of the constabulary, will fly to

^he ambush of Mrs. Aurora Que-

announced last night. 

Immediately upon receipt of a 
telegram from Gen. Rafael Jalan-

tuan had contacted the band, 
ranging from 50 to 100 in num- 
ber, and that a pitched battle was 
going on near the scene of the 
^ ambush. 

Among the units in the area is 
M«ij. Napoleon Valeriano’s famous 
combat team, “Nenita,” which has 
long waged effective battle with 
dissident elements in Central Lu- 
zon. 

President Quirino, who is in Ba- 
guio, first received ‘advice of the 
ambush through a telegram from 
Gdvernor Juan O. Chioco of Nue- 
va Ecija. He immediately called 
upon General Ivlariano Castaneda 
and General Ramos to summon all 
the available forces for an all-out 
campaign to eliminate the band- 
its in the Nueva Ecija area. 

At the same time, the President 
directed Evangelista to mobilize

Outlaws Attack Party On Peaceful 
Mission, Rob Bodies; Casualties 
Include QC Mayor, Other Officials 


PHILIP BIJENCAMINO III 


The remains of Mrs. Aurora Aragon de Quezon, her daughter 
Maria Aurora (Baby) and nine other victims of a Huk ambuscade _ 
in Nueva Ecija yesterday were brought to Manila last night in a 
funeral motorcade for .interment in Manila as the nation slowly 
recovered from the shock of the first report on the ambush. 

Mrs. Quezon and her daughter and members of her party were 
killed on the Bongabon-Baler ihterprovincial road at 11:30 a. m. 
yesterday by a strong band of well armed Hukbalahaps. They were 
slain, after the cars in Mrs. Quezon’s motorcade had stopped and had 
identified the party as that of Mrs. Quezon. Then the bandits strip- 
ped the bodies of jewels and valuables. 

The widow of President Quezon met tragic d^ath with loved 
ones and friends as she led a party of about 50 relatives and asso- 
ciates on a motor trip to Baler, Quezon, her hometown, to unveil the 
historical marker on the birthplace of President Quezon and to attend 
the town fiesta and the inauguration of the Baler hospital. 

The party was approaching Villa Aurora, still on Nueva Ecija 
soil, and was passing through a zig-zag road on hilly terrain wlien 
the leading cars were subjected to heavy enfilading fire. 

Quezon City Mayor Ponciano Bernardo, who was in the leading 
car with Mrs. Quezon, Baby Quezon, Maj. Gen. Rafael Jalandoni, 
Philip Buencamino III and Antonio San Agustin, left the car with 
his hands up in token of surrender and shouted: “This is Mrs. 

Quezon’s party.’’ He was shot dead as he yelled. 

As all cars screeched to a stop, men swarmed around the lea ding: 
car. When Gen. Jalandoni saw the outlaws, ho' grabbed a .45 caliber 
automatic pistol and was cocking it when an outlaw struck him on 
the cheek with the butt of a rifle. As-he dropped to the floor of the 
car, he' heard volleys fired into its occupants. 

The casualty list as officially reported to Malacaiian as of 9 
o’clock last night. 

Known dead: 

1. Dona Aurora A. Quezon 

2. Miss Maria Aurora (Baby^ Quezon, Mrs. Quezon’s 

daughter. 

3. Philip Buencamino III, Mrs. Quezon’s son-in-law. 

4. Mayor Ponciano Bernardo of Quezon City 

5. Col. Primitivo San Agustin, chief of the army military 

intelligence service. 

6 . Major Antonio San Agustin, assistant manager of the 

Philippine charity sweepstakes office. 

7. Juan Molina, relative of Mrs. Quezon

general Mariano Castaneda and' 

General Alberto Ramos to summon 
all the available forces for a full- 
dress campaign to eliminate the 
bandits in the Nueva Ecija area. 

3. At the same time the Pres- 
ident ordered Secretary Evange - 1 
lista. to mobilize all possible assist- ’ 
ance to the wounded. 

The President was said to have 
expressed the belief that the as- 
sailants were not Huks. The 
President reportedly said he could 
not believe that Huks meant to 
do any harm to Mrs. Quezon be- 
cause she was loved even by them. 

First official reports from Gen- 1 
eral Jalandoni received in Mala- j 
cafian said that, the ambuscade 
occurred between 10 and 11 yes- 
terday morning beyond the Que- 
zon boimdary about 60 kilometers 
from Bohgabon, Nueva Ecija. 

^ According to a wire from Gen- 
eral Jalandoni, the “highway rob- 
bers had all gone after they have 
looted us.’' 

Acting on the orders of the Pres- 
ident, Secretary Evangelista mob- 
ilized the Red Cross and the Phil- 
ippine Air Force to fly blood plas-

Thinking that all the occupdnts

their shots at the succeeding jeeps

ATROCITV COMPOUNDED \ 
The nation is in mourning todi, \ 
lit tho death of a great ladj ' 
It is more than shocked at thV 
nature of her death, and that of 
close members of her family and 
others in the ambu.scade that 
ended the life of Aurora Aragon 
Quezon. 

There is a revulsion of the na- 
tional spirit at the perpetrators^ 
of tlie crime. There can be no- 
doubt that they were Hukbala- 
haps. Hie general knowledge of 
the advent of Mrs. Quezon and 
■' her party to Baler makes it seem 
‘unlikely that the amibush was less 
than intentional and planned. The 
news had been broadcast and aii- 
iiouncod in the press and the wel- 
come signs were up. 

The people of the country hard- 
ly knew how much they revered 
and respected the widow of the 
late President Quezon. Her quiet 
influence for good, her conscien- 
tious and effective work on behalf 
of the Red Cross, her concern for 
the people and the beautiful grace 
with which advancing years rested 
upon her had made her more of a 
national .symbol than perhaps she j 
herself realized. I. 

It took sudden death to bring :i 
about a realization of her position | 
in the land. In reality it was that 
of First Lady, both yesterday and 
toda.y. And it seemed to require 
an atrocity of the magnitude of 
yesterday’s to bring the people to 
full realization of the desperate 
wickedness and senseless bravado 
of those who call themselves 
Huks, they and their misguided 
followers. 

There seems no alternative now 
ito a determined pursuit and liqui- 
dation of the dissidents of central 
Luzon. They have finally coin- 
mi tied the unpardonable sin. 
There may have been a residual 
sympathy for the Hubs because 
of thoir economic underprivilege, 
but nhen they seek to call na- 
tional attention to their plight by 
deliberately destroying a mitional- 
ly-lov(Ml symbol of decency, of

Assurances of peace previously 
issued by top-rank government 
men were thrown back into their 
teeth. 

In the face of an expressed be- 
lief by Brig. Gen. Alberto Ramos 
that Huks might not have been 
responsible for the murders. Sen- 
ator Pablo Angeles David de- 
clared Huks were “definitely” the 
slayers. 

.A move was started in the lower 
house for the investigation of 
Ramos. 

Former interior Secretary Jose 
C. Zulueta castigated “mislead- 
ing” official reports that peace 
and order has been restored. 

In the wake of President Qui- 
rlno's order reported issued in

‘‘Fighting was in progress” at the ambush scene this 
morning between a 1,600-man punitive force and dissidents 
who murdered Mrs. Aurora Aragon Quezon and 11 mem- 
bers of her party. 

The battle reached a high pitch as private and offi- 
cial quarters laid blame for the massacre at the door of 
the administration. 


Baguio for an all-out drive 
against the dissidents, tanks, ar- 
tillery and armored cars roUed 
nearer to Huk entrenchments, 
Army planes* scoured the Sierra 
Madre area for signs of the dis- 
sidents. 

The Armed Force.s of the PhU- 
ippiiies tied in plans for the drive 
in conjunction with the constab- 
ulary. Brig. Gen. Calixto Duque, 
AFP deputy chief of staff, urged 
a drastic “zoning** program in the 
dissident area for total extermi- 
nation of the Huks. 

Suspicion brew'ed among solons 
today that the fatal ambuscade 
was a deliberate plan to murder

Mrs. Aurora Quezon and her 
family by former tenants on the 
Quezon family's Arayat hacienda 
W’ho have turned Huks. 

Meantime, an opinion was ex- 
pressed that disgruntled former 
tenants of the one-time Quezon 
hacienda in Pampanga w’ere re- 
sponsible for the outrage. 

Indications were shown that 
the ambuscade was deliberately 
planned for the extermination of 
the Quezon family. 

Countries all over the world 
expressed shock and dismay over 
the murder of Mrs. Quezon. 
Messages of condolence poured 
into the foreign office from such 
governments as Australia. 

The sneak attack took place 
in barrio Salubusob, 62 kilome- 
ters away from Bongabon, Nue- 
va Ecija, Col. Macario Asistio of 
the PC disclosed this morning 
as he left for the ambush scene. 

Information reaching PC 
headquarters said that about 300 
dissidents participated In the 
ambush. They Were led by 
Commanders Viernes, Marzon, 
Lupo, and Mulong. 


A combined PC-AFP force 
j estimated at 1,600 is participat- 
1 ing in the manhunt. Reports 
that PC troops had contacted 
• the fleeing dissidents were con- 
firmed this morning. No de- 
tails were available although 
‘‘fighting was in progress.” 

TaiiKs at the PC headquarters 
compound and in the Southern 
Luzon Zone command in Balara, 
Quezon City, w'ere ordered last 
night to proceed to Nueva Ecija. 

About 1.000 PC troops from the 
1st combat . oattalion were alerted 
for the all-out offensive against 
the Nueva Ecija dissidents 

Gov. Juan O. Chioco of Nueva 
Ecija ordered town mayors, police 
figencies. and civilian guards in the 
province to press the manhunt 
for the ambushers. 

Rep. Justiniano Montano (L, 
Cavite) , today whipped up con- 
gress sentiment for immediate 
merger of the armed forces and 
the constabulary as the govern- 
ment’s answer to renewal of Huk 
ambuscades that culminated in a 
near-niiassacre of Mrs. Aurora. 
Quezon’s party yesterday. 

Rep. Manuel Soza (L, Cebu'» , 
said “the sentiment in congress is 
for hiking appropriations for the 
constabulary” to put an end to or- 
ganized dissidence. 

“I think congress will act quick- 
ly on current proposals to hike 
outlays for this purpose,” he em- 
ph.'\size< 


Some solons demanded Briga- 
dier General Rafael Ramos. PC 
chief of staff, be placed on the 
carpet for relaxing PC patrol ac- 
tivities, despite constant appeal.s 
from Central Luzon governors for 
more PC assistance. 

Other solons, particularly Reps. 
Eduardo Barretto (L Laguna >, 
Pacifico Lim (L, Sorsogonh and 
Pedro Munoz (L, 3a tan gas' urged 
a probe of the PC commands in 
Cabanatuan and Quezon. 

They said that the PC troops 
there should have cleared the way 
fli'st for the party, knowing the 
highway was very unsafe and lit- 
tle used because holdups and kill- 
ings were frequently committed , 
tiiere 

Senator* and congressmen led 
the country in expressing shock 
and grief at yesterday’s tragedy. 

Senate President Mariano Je- 
ws Cuenco. mourning the death 
of Mrs. Quezon and others in the 
hands of Huks, declared the gov- 
ernment must continue without 
letup its war against Huks and ' 
bandits. j 

Last night PC headquarters an- ^ 
nounced tnat a constabulary force 
had contacted the ambush band 
near the scene of the attack. A 
pitched battle is in progress, it was 
said.

The Ambush On Mrs. Quezon 
And Party 

UFiDER — mass murder — has occurred 
on the highways! 

Tlie ambuscade which resulted in the tra- 
gic death of Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon, h^r 
daughter Maria (Baby), her son-in-law Phi- 
lip Buencamino, Mayor Ponciano Bernardo, 
and several other well-known persons, comes 
as a shocking commentary on the peace and 
order situatipn in this country. 

No single tragedy epitomizes the serious- 
ness of our peace problem more than this 
attack on innocent citizens by lawless ele- 
ments roaming the country today. 

I.»ately, there has been a tendency to min- 
imize the gravity of our peace and order 
situation. VVe like to believe that this is a 
result of an underestimation, more than it 
is an attempt to give a false sense of secur- 
ity to the public. But, certainly, in the face 
of the tragedy of the Quezons and others 
who died in the ambuscade, the fact stai’es 
us in the face that the suppression of vio- 
lence and lawlessness still constitutes a ma- 
jor undertaking the sucessful prosecution of 
which cannot, and should not, admit of any 
let-up. 

No amount of pretty talk can deny that 
fact now. 

Today’s demand is clearly that we go all- 
out for peace, against lawlessness, on the 
home front. 

In the meantime, we moum the death of 
llrs. Quezon for whom the people of this 
country reserve considerable respect and love 
not only because she was the widow of the 
Pi‘6sident Quezon whose memory is uni- 
versally revered, but also because in her own 
right Mrs. Quezon occupies a distinguished 
mchc in the national life. 

She is a great loss to the countiTr. As 
head of the Philippine Red Cross, she has 
spaidved local activity in behalf of the poor 
and needy and suffering. She was among 
the most tireless social workers of our dav. 

Tlie people mark the day of her violent 
and untimely death with deep sorrow and 
regret. They remember her kindness and 
pnerosity and know that they have lost a 
lovable personality and a great lady.

not give full redress to the 
wrong. 

This is no time for indigna- 
tion. 

There has been enough of 
it in recent months. 

Twenty-four hours have 
passed since the beloved 
widow of a beloved leader, j 
with 11 others were massac- 
red. The nation has suffer- 
ed an irreparable loss in the 
death of Mrs. Quezon, emblem 
of the greatness of our De- 
parted Leader and Father of 
Our Country, President Ma- 
nuel L. Quezon. A sober nation 
may now take stock of itself 
and of the ignominous failings 
of its present leaders. 

Graft and corruption, con- 
stitutional violations, traffic- 
king in public funds, traffic- 
king ill public office, heed- 
less wastage of the people’s 
money even these are nothing 
in comparison with the high 
crime of plain inability to of- 
fer the citizen common pro- 
, tection. That inability has 
I been made ^tent by .seven 
I ambuscades in Nueva Ecija 
j alone during the month. 

I There has been a horrify- 
; ing omission somewhere 
which borders upon wanton 
•disregard for the public safe- 
ty. 


The senqte in a session 

today approved a resolution of 
condolence and decided to ad- 
journ until Tuesday as a token of 
respect to Mrs. Aurora Araffon 
de Quezon and two members of 
her immediate family. 


It was Senator Lopez who asked 
that a viva voce vote be taken, 
instead of nominal. 

The resolution follows: 

“Whereas, Aurora Arag:on de Quezon, 
widow of the firKt president of the Phi- 
lippines, Mannel L. Quexon, and chair- 
man of the Philippine National Red Cross, 
her eldest daughter, Maria Aurora Que- 
zon, and &on-tn-Iaw, F. Buencamino II. 
who were on their way to Baler to unveil 
the marker of the birthplace of the late 
President Quezon, were murdered April 
28. KM9 in Bongabon, Nueva Ecija, with 
seven others in a brutal bandit attack ; 

“Whereas, Mrs. Quezon was not only ttve 
wife of the beloved FiUpino leader but 
also a great social worker who devoted 
quietly and unceremoniously the best part 
t>f her life in ameUorating the plight of 
the underprivileged, and in muiistering to 
the need of the needy and in alleviating 
the sorrows of those who have been thre- 
atened with disaster and misfortune; 

Whereas Mrs. Quezon for many years 
was a great stabilizing factor In the color- 
rut life of our leader. Manuel L. Quezon, 
and dntifnl mother, social worker of un- 
blemished character, patron of arts, let- 
ters, masic. embodiment of Filipino wo- 
manhood and letely chairman of the Phi- 
I hppine National Red Cross; 

I be it resolved that the 

! senate of the Republic of the Philippines, 
express deepest grief which ihe nation

W HEN WE received the 
news of the Quezon 
ambuscade yesterday we were 
so stunned that as we read 
the dispatches from our cor- 
respondent in fhe province 
we couldn’t believe it at first. 
As the hour dragged on and 
more dispatches flowed into 
the office, we still muttered 
to ourself: “It. can’t be 

true.”

And as we sat down before our 
typewriter, we didn’t even want to 
look at the column we’d prepared 
earlier yesterday. We felt it to 
be out of line and put of time 
before this national tragedy and

Rep. Marcia Rahola (L, Albay) : 
“This is a national blot to the

Mrs. Aurora Aragon Quezon was , 
born in Baler, Tayabas, February 
19, sixty years ago. Her parents 
were Pedro Aragbn and Zenaida ^ 
Molina. Receiving rudiments of 
education at the Franciscan Friar’s 
school in her hometown, she pur- . 
sued her studies to Lucena then - 
to Manila where she enrolled at 
the normal school. : 

Aurora Aragon was the belle of | 
Baler. | 

Aurora and her first cousin ‘ 
(their mothers were sisters), ■ 
young Manuel, 11 years her senior, ' 
were constant playmates. When 
cousin “Nonong” as she used to 
call him, was orphaned, he lived 
with Aurora’s family. On Dec. 
14. 1918. after 12 long years of 
engagement, they were married in 
Hongkong. Quezon was then sen- 
ate president. 

Three children were born: Ma- 
ria Aurora (Baby), Zenaida (Ni- 
ni), and Manuel, Jr. (Nonong). 
Of their married life, Quezon 
wrote in The Good Fight: “Twen- 
ty-four years of married life with 
the same wife have proved that 
matrimonial happiness does not 
depend upon the noise of the w’ed- 
ding. Nor for that 'matter upon 
closing one’s eyes to the sight of j 
•other beauties and running away 
from their company...” | 

Throughout the years and until 
his death, this wemian stood side 
by side with her husband, inspir- 
ing him, counseling him^ during 
his crucial struggles to attain 
prosperity, happiness and content- 
ment for the people. 

Two of the doctorate degrees, 
honoris causa, conferred on her 
by the Mary grove college (Detroit, 
Mich.) and by the Philfppine 
Women’s university were “in rec- 
ognition of her outstanding serv- 
ices to the cause of humanity.” 

After her husband’s death in Sa- 
ranac, New York, on Aug. 1, 1944, 
as they waited for the liberation 
of the Philippines, Mrs. Quezon 
and family devoted their time and 
attention to charity and social 
welfare work. 

I Seeing in the Philippine Na- 
I tional Red Cross an opportunity to 
'continue her husband’s service to 
the people, Mrs. Quezon accepted 
the chairmanship of the organiza- 
tion, which position she held until 
her death. 


Aurora Aragon Quezon was, in 
the words of one of her hus- 
band’s biographers, “the enchant- 
ing maiden, the mature w'oman, 
the Filipino’s Guardian Angel of 
the Dawn,— the Dawn of Filipino 
Independence. . . It is to her quiet, 
unobtrusive, self-effacing influ- 
ence and example, to her personal 
piety and conjugal devotion, that 
Quezon owed in lai-ge measure his 
steadfast purpose and undeviating 
determination to carry through his 
program of Social Justice . . . Side 
[by side with her husband, she 
brought him through all the years, 

I rich store of comfort and counsel 
and unfailing encouragement in 
his public career ... a model of 
Filipino wdfe and motherhood, the 
mother of his children, the 
guardian of his hearth and 

home. . .” 

Of Maria Aurora (Baby). Que- 
zon the late President Quezon bod 
been very fond. In his famous 
autobiography The Good Fight, 
Quezon had frequently made men- 
tion of Baby, how during the 
bombing of Manila she and her 
friends stayed at Malacanan 
wrapping up Christmas gifts for 
the soldiers, gifts which had been 
collected by public sub.scription 
upon the initiative of my eldest 
daughter, Maria. . 

Quezon also wrote of how she 
and her sister volunteered their 
services to the chief nurse Jn Cor- 
regidor, “making beds for the pa- 
tients and also folding gauze for 
the operating room.” He related 
how she was not satisfied with 
this and insisted that she should 
visit the front. Quezon and Mac- 
Art'nui' both politely and tactfully 
rejected her plan. 

Baby used to be Quezon’s con- 
stant companion on his trips out- 
side the tunnel in Corregidor dur- 
ing the lull in the Japanese bomb-

NATION IN PAYING 
PINAL TmUTE 

^First Lady’, ‘Baby’ And 
Philip Buencaniino Interred; 
Throngs View Rites, Cortege 

The people ol: the Philippines 
paid their last tribute to Mrs. 
Aurora Aragon Quezon yesterday. 

The former First Lady of the 
Land — who seemed to carry the 
Title still — ^was laid to rest at tA»vi 
light, in the Quezon family plot 
in the North Cemetery in triple 
.funeral rites together with her 
elder daughter, Maria Aurora 
(Baby) Quezon, and her son-in- 
law. Felipe (Philip) Buencamino 

m. 

These three, family of the illus 
trious Manuel L. Quezon, were 
the first of the victims massacred 
in the Hukbalahap ambuscade 
Thursday to be buried. This was 
in accordance with the wishes of 
suvviving memhers of the family 
Mrs. Nini Quezon Buencamino 
and Manuel (Nonong) Quezon, Jr, 
— who had requested a simple fu- 
neral. 

There was nothing ostentatious 
about yesterday’s funeral, but' 
simple it could not be. Mrs. Que- '! 
zon and her daughter were be-ji 
loved lOESf too many. Through their 
numerous charitable deeds, they 
belonged to the masses they had 
, helped — and who now wanted to 
pay their last tribute. j! 

The crowd was estimated atjl 
several hundred thousand. It in- - 
' <^Uded people from all walks ofi| 
— President Quirino and his'! 

‘ daughter, Vick\', top-ranking gov-'* 
eminent officials, representatives 
of foreign governments, social 
workers, and students. People 
from the streets also shuffled into 
the University of Santo Tomas 
Chapel to stand with bowed hea'^‘ 

. as Father Albert Santamaria 
.«;hook the censers and the choir 
■’‘chanted the Liberame Domine and

MRS. QUEZON" IS LAID TO REST. The First Lady came to rest beside her illustrlons husband 
at Cementerio del Norte last evening as grief stricken friends and relatives struggled to fight back 
tears, and failed, over her sudden and tragic end. The President stood at the head of the casket 
while high government officials watched as Mrs. Aurora Quezon was laid to her final resting place.

Luzon provinces. 

The general consensus here 
blames the Philippine Consta- 
bularv intelligence units for 
their failure to locate the Huk 
positions along the Baler na- 
tional highway from this pro- 
vince. The same ambushers were 
believed responsible for the hi- 
jacking of lumber trucks that 
rolled over the same highway. 

Other sources also blamed 
relaxed PC operations here to 
the revamping of the constabu- 
lary commands here, with the 
relief of Col. Demetrlo Camua 
and his veteran company com- 
manders, by Lt. Col. Angel Ma- 
gallanes. The same informants 
said that the new officers are 
unused to the terrain of this 
province. This was believed, to 
have been responsible for the 
weak intelligence operations of 
the PC. 

1 Additional reports on the 
^ Quezon tragedy that trickled 
Into this capital said that Gen- 
eral Rafael Jalandoni was 
spared by the Huks because of 
bis civilian attire. One Huk 
wa.s said to have been heard as 
saying that Jalandoni be spar- 
ed because “he Is a civilian." 

Intensified Huk activity was 
reported In other towns of this 
province, with the killing of 
four. persons, and the wounding 
of another, by the dissidents. 
The Hukhalahaps, according to 
PC reports killed their victims 
while attempting to rob the 
latter’s houses in barrio San

In Bacolod, the delegates to

over the killing. The news of 
the tragedy was IieiiJ over the

Ro.sarlo Valdez, is preparing ela-

i PA and PC investigators today

came from that town two days 
before the ambuscade. 

The Huks, according to tue . 
government informants, : 

the residents not to disclose the , 
location of the dissidents.^ ^ ; 

Careful scrutiny of the gun 
emplacements disclosed that the 
killers of Mrs. Quezon used auto- 
matic rifles and not machine 
guns as previously reported. Tli*e 
gun emplacements revealed that 
Huks were prepared for the am- 
buscade as each vehicle was fired 
upon simultaneously by separate 
nests of automatic rifles, causing 
the sudden death of the victims. 

Mrs. Quezon’s car was hit 21 
times. Mrs. Quezon was found 
lifeless riddled with bullets in- 
side the car as the Huks dragged 
her In search for jewelry and 
cash. 

Capt. Burgosino Faustino and 
several PC escorts riding the 
fourth vehicle were rounding the 
bend when the Huks fired at 
some members of the Quezon 
party. They immediately jump- 
ed to the ground for cover. They 
engaged the Huks from a dis- 
tance of 1,000 yards. 

I Traces of blood were found 
: from the Huk positions. Ina^esti- 
gators believed that the anibusli- 
ers* also suffered casualties in the 
; exchange of gunfire "with PC

Captain Faustino also lald

Baguio Mourns 
Quezons’ Death 
Inlluk Ambush 

b All Baguio Is still niourning 
rh6 lose of Mrs. Aurora A. Que- 
2011 and her daughter Marla 
Aurora (Baby), including her 
son-in-law, Phillip Bueucamino 
III, who were victims of a Huk 

ambush in. Boftgabon, Nueva ^ ... . .v ... 

Ecija, last Thursday morning. 1 hfe, Hcntly ulu-ii sfu* binlt a summer 


Baguio joins the nation in Its ! her life prior to tier unrortua- 
bereavement over the tragedy j at© and inhuman deatli he with 
tfuit befell Mrs. Quezon, her us and be Baguio’s way of per- 
daiigliter Baby, and several of petuating her dear ineiiiory, 

her party two days ago. Resi- — 

deiit.s of this city have reason j it >>ouhl have been seJI’isfi ol 
to feel deeply the efforts of this i Raguio to have prevaileil on her 
j tragic loss, (smsidering that (o stay with u.s more perrai- 


The flrat news about the tra- 
gedy reaching Baguio early in 
the afternoon of that day- 
through ihe local C.’hronicl© bu- 
reau shocked the populace as 
It travelled like wild-i’ire around 
the city. 


! Mrs. Teodora M. Flores, PN- 
RC administrator in Baguio and 
niece of the Quezons, and i)r. 
Andres A. Angara, city health 
officer and a nephew of the for- 
mer First Lady, were simply 
stunned by the nows and first 
refused to believe the report 
was true. Together with other 
near relatives of the Quezons in 
Baguio, both left, by plane ear- 
i ly the following day for Mani- 
la to join the bereaved family, 
i Mrs. Quezon, who has a suin- 
' mer residence and apartment 
; houses here, is considered a lo- 
cal resident and benefactor of 
! several local civic societies. A 
■ Catholic leatler, she has recent- 
ly made the annual civic so- 
cieties. A CaUiolic leader, she 
has recently made the annual 
Novena to Our Lady of Lour- 
des celebrated at her private 
grotto on Klsad Road, as a tra- 
dlUoual fiesta among the Ba- j 
gulo laity. During the Novena | 
last February, the occasion was | 
made a special Catholic event i 
participated in by Baguio’s pro- j 
minent and leading citizens ' 
througU the inspiring efforts of :

'■.v-'eL majority of city’s inhaf)i- 
umu who kn-v/ her by namo 
all mourn deep-ly Mrs. Quezons 
and Baby’s passing away. La 
bv’s Baguio friends were snul- 
'■oriv «?Hocked upon hearing that 
t^Vwas among those who wera 

•’-I” o\ne‘rc«ua'jrfto the 

I zou party,

Ths deceased mayor 
w served the Ci*-y 
goto as assistant city 

from 1^36 to 1039 . 


r::E i 

Now that the initial shock 
is over, let's take stock. 

We must not lose our 
heads. W’c must guard ag- 
ainst striking out blimlly. 
lvct‘8 think the whol^ thing 
out. 

'J'liere can be no dispute 
that the murderers of the 

u‘y.on family ami others in 
tiK^r party should be made to 

fe<*l the fullest severity of 

the law. They should be 

tracked down like the cold- 
blooded criminals that they 
are, and should be punished 
to Ihe last man. 

But what we should be 
afraid of i.s. Id the height of 
their fury winch would be 
fanned by the knowledge that 
perhaps they had lost prestige, 
our poli<*e forces might sub- 
ject til© civilian population of 
Central 1 ,uzoq to a blotul bath. 
It Is w> ea.sy to vent anger on 
tlio.s© who .stand by helplessly, 
j mule and seemingly uncoope- 
rati\© becau^,^ of fear of re- 
i vengc. It I.S so easy -to burn 
1 their house.s, or niachinegun 
their women and children, or 
put everjlKuly to 1h© sword. 

But would that be the wl«?« 
poli<-y? 


Kveu if .Mrs. Quezon luul 
survived llu* hori'ihle massa- 
cre, she’d have been the first 
one to raise a hand against 
wanton, unreasoning revenge. 
She would liave rcalizexl that 
violcn<*e only begets violeuc<*, 
that once a cliain of violent 
acts is starred, there would 
be no end to it. 

It’s so easy to bring out the 
tanks, the flame throwers, 
the trench mortars and all the 
Instruments of war, hut for 
■ licavens’ sake, spare the inno- 
cent live.s In the ensuing holo- 
caust. 

In the Bongabon massacre, 
It is tlie side of tlie dissidents 
that lost heavily, not Ihe side 
of p<*nce and order to W'liicli 
Mrs. Quezon belonged]. The 
side of peace and onler only 
lost a dozen lives — precious 
lives. It l« true, hut. never- 
theless Just a short slay on 
fills eartli against a backdrop 
of wiiole eternity. But the 
Bide of the dissidents — call 
them mi.sguided, if >ou will — 
lo.st more. Tiiey did not lo.s© 
lives but tliey lost understand- 
ing. They lost .\vmpalhy. In 
the final analysis, such a loss 
i» more to be felt than the 
snuffing of human lives.

author said. 

Quezon recalled how his aunt’s 
death had removed the last ob- 
stacle to his marriage. She liad 
vigorously opposed her nephev/’s 
wish. It was as though God him- ’ 
self had intervened to bring him 
and Aurora together. 

Contrary to the Filipino cus- 
tom of celebrating pompous and 
extravagant weddings, he and 
ihe young, modest, and beautiful 
Aurora were married in Hong- 
kong dressed in simple street 
clothe.s and with only a few peo- 
ple in attendance.

I regidor with the general. VVheu

the war is the only Question be-

Hers w^as a bitter role to play 
in those trying days. She was 
also torn between wanting to

to be at her husband’s side, 
zon told her lie wanted her to

once. When a modestly c»ad, 
insignificant - looking fellow 
asked him what had happened, 

Ke brushed the question aside 
■with, “Ask so*and-so. He 
knows more about it thsn I 
do.” 

Then a group of new*spapcr- 
women asked him about kis 
experiences. Contrary to . 
what he had previously said, j 
he seemed to have keen^ in | 
iKe thick of things. The he- 
ro** became loquacious. He 
toldi and retold his tale with j 
gusto'. * 

I was impressed by his con- 
duct. 1 wondered how a man, 
just a few hours ago witness 
to the massacre of so many 
people^ could have been so 
concerned v/ith this mundane 

thought: publicity. 

.-s # ♦ 

People arc still talking 
about it. They have not rc- 
cosrered from their shock, their 
grief, or their indignation. 
il was not the death of Mrs 
Quezon that shocked them 

most all mortals have to die 

but that such a gentle wo- 
man should have met a vio- 
lent death. 

it will take some time be- 
fore they get over the fact 
that she was riddled with bul- 
lets at close range and treat- 
ed by the killers with such sa- 
vagery and contempt. 

“You can have your Mrs. 

Quezon the lady with the 

white hair she is dead now,’* 

Huks told the drivers whete 
lives they had spared.

The national tragedy has 
shocked people into sobriety 
a»d quieter living — at least 
for a time. Tljougkts long bu- 
ried in the deepest recessec of 
their minds have been an- 
earthed Questiens continue 
to be asked. The fear of the 
unknown, not felt in their 
more sanguine moments, oc- 
copies their thoughts. 

But this gloom will pesa. 
Politicians will soon start taik- 
iwg about other things. That 
is, if they have not yet. So- 
ciety matrons will start get- 
•.iping again. Perhaps taey 
already have. And the rest 
of «>e will once more be in- 
teoady preoccupied with liv- 
ing. 

Our na*^* »i mI prol terns v ill 
continue to remain unsolved.

STOP THOSE AMBUSCADES 


T he record shows that there have 

seven ambuscades during the month in 
wev a Ecija alone. That’s too many acts ot 
lawlessness within such a short span of time. 

last of these occurred only nine hours 
^^ter the tragic killing of Mrs. Aurora A. 
Quezon and eleven oihei*s while on their way 
to Baler, Quezon. 

ambuscades a w’eek should provide 
sufficient waming to those in authority to 
take g“reater security measures in order to 
protect innocent lives. Too many have al- 
ready been lost. It should be apparent from 
these frequent depredations that there ^ 
^o sense in allowing ourselves to be lulled 
hate a false sense of security. 

TThere must be constant vigilance on the 
part of those in whose hands depends pub- j 
lie security. Koihing should be taken for 
granted. 'We cannot regard the frequent, 
thoug'h scattered, attacks as mere symptoms. 
The more realistic attitude would be to con- 
sider them pail of a pattern, an oi'ganized 
■whole, which constitutes a grave menace to 
the law-abiding. The ambush which took 
place in Nuevc- Ecija several hours after the 
dastardly attack that cost the Itfe of Mrs. 
Quezon coukl easily be a diversionary tac- 
tic to draw away law enforcement agents 
from the scene of the murder of the Que- 
zons. 

Until such time as the country’’ is rid of 
its lawless elements, security measures 
should be taken to give the public max- 
imum assurance of safety in their peaceful 
endeavors to help make a go of this repub- 
lic. ' 

It should help a great deal to prevent am- 
buscades and highway robberies and kill- 
ings if mobile patrols are put to work in i 
known dangerous sections of highways. 
r>uri ng dangerous hours, busses and other 
vehicles could be stopped at checkpoints and 
convoyed by well-armed patrols. This should 
assure a reasonable amount of safety and 
should help facilitate the task of bringing 
to justice those responsible for an attack 
when and if it is peiiDetrated. 


Eiorial Digest 


In unison, the Manila papers cr\’- out for swift 
ju.stice against the perpetrators oil the murder of 
Mrs. Aui’ora Ai'agon Quezon and li members of 
her party. It’s the last straw, they all say in effect, 
in words as follows: 

>€ >« 


The Munilu Times: “A people cowers in sor- 

row today. The most revered woman in the land, 
her daughter, ten others were massacred, while 
traveling on a public road... this fact cannot be 
explained, cannot be excused, cannot be rational- 
ized . . . E>oha Aurora, the widow of Manuel L. Que- 
zon, the QUiet .shining lamp that held before the 
people the memory of that flaming light of free- 
dom that was Quezon, was murdered. And the 
people cowers in son’ow — and w'aits — for more 
murders?’* 


>« X X 

The Manila Chronicle: “The question is WHY. 
VVhy a movement whose leaders claim to be ins- 
pired by a passion to improve life must needs des- , 
troy innocent life to attain its ends. Why the tra- i 
gic hand of chance must fall on a woman, beloved 
of her people: on a woman whose heart went even 
for those who snuffed out her life. No crime could 
Ije more heinous. The circurasUmces which 
brought to fi*uition the tragedy of >*e.sterday must 
be rooted out once and for all or Mrs. Quezon shall 
iiave died in vain.”

ternative now to a determined pursuit, and liquids

MacArthurs Send 
Condolences 

I General and Mrs. Douglas Mac- 
'• Arthur have extended their dee^ 
ifist sympathy to members of the

Romulo Believes 
Ambushers Huks 


SAN FRANCISCO, April 29 
(AP^ , — Belief that “ccmmuiiist- 
inspired Huks” committed the am- 
bush slaying of Mrs. Aurora Que- 
zon in the Philippi-ne.s was ex- 
pressed here Thursday by Brig. . 
General Carlos P. Romulo. 

Romulo referred to the Hukba- 
lahaps, armed peasant guerrillas 
who have been active since war’s 
end. 

Romulo paused here en route 
from the Philippines to Lake Suc- 
cess as chief Philippine delegate 
to the United Nations. 

Romulo said the attack oc- 
curred in a section where Huks 
are hiding out. He discounted a 
suggestion the ambush was the 
work of bandits. 

He said the Huks have also been 
known to rob their victims. 

^‘She was liked by everyone and 
had no enemies,”, he said. “She 
husband. Here work in the Philip- 
pines — even after the death of her 
husband. He work in the Philip- 
pine Red Cross was something 
that will live forever. She was a 
lady of such dignity.”

lined the funeral route along 
Espaha, Quezon boulevard, Az- 
carraga, Rizal avenue, and Blu- 
mentritt yesterday afternoon. 
President Quirino was the most 
distinguished among the mour- 
ners. By being one of the pall- 
bearers of Mrs. Quezon’s casket 
as it left the University of San- 
to Tomas chapel at 1 p.m., the 
President broke an old tradition, 
established the precedent for a 
Chief Executive to be a paUbear- 
er for a private citizen.

Hundreds Answer 
Call For Blood 

That Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon 
was beloved by everyone was made 
evident last Thursday evening 
w'hen moie than 200 people of al- 
most ?.il nationalities residing in 
Manila flocked to the Philippine 
, National aed Cross blood bank to 
donate part of their blood. 

i The tremendous response was in 
(answer to the Red Cross appeal 
(flashed over all Manilas radio 
[stations for Type O blood urgently 
j needed to help save the lives of 
I those critically injured due to the 
; Quezon party ambuscade. Earlier 
in the afternoon, the entire blood 
Type O stoc-.k of the Red Cross 
was flown to the Cabanatuan prov- 
incial hosuital w'here the injured 
were hostitalized. 

The answer to the radio blood 
appieal flashed over stations 
DZMB. DZRH, and DZPI was elec- 
tric. Immediately after the first 
flash, at about 5 p.m. pro.spective 
donors started pouring into PNRC 
i headq>aarters at the corner of 
; ^aac Peral and Taft Avenue. 
I Such was Mi-s. Quezon’s prestige 
I that even one woman, not know- 
ing that the former first lady was 
dead, volunteered to donate even 
1 half of her entire blood thinking it 
I would save the PNRC chairman.

The following communication 
prefaced with a letter to the edi- 
tor of the Manila t.’hronlcle was 
received by this newspaper last 
night from Luis Taruc, com- 
mander-in-chief of the Hukba- 
lahap, who speatei iu connection 
with the inafwre of Hr*. Au- 
rora Quezon and her companions 
on the BongabOli- Baler rosad: 

“April 2», 194J 
“Dear 'Mr. Del Rosario: 


(Which are welLknown among 
the peasant masses for their 
iustice and impartiality) reveal 
anv negligence or breach of the

ganization that is related 'to the < 
people’s movement. . 

“Let us be truthful and blunt. |: 
The mailed-fist policy, before 
the death of Mrs. .Quezon, has ; 
reached its bankruptcy, forcingji 
a popular clamor for its rever- i 
gal. The imperialists and their " 
puppets, always adept at tricks 
to mislead public opinion, are 
auick'to create or utilize inci- 
dents to justify the continuance 
and even intensification of a po- 
licy which is already thorough- 
ly discredited. Is it not rather 
iiiiraculous that of the six oc- 
cupants of Mrs. Quezon’s car, 
only General Jalaiidoni should 
survive? is it not also , myste- 
i-ious that Mrs. Quezon, having 
frequently travelled from Ara-

brought about the tragedy. 

Tlie people, who are tfie ul- 
tiiiiato judge of the acta of 
both Hie Jinks and the gov- 
ernment are as bitter in their 
d(*nua<iatioii of tlie Uukjs as 
they are of the gross negli- 
gence of the government. Thla

Quezon tragedy but also in 
tlie killing of so many other

Mhi«*h ha.s given patent manl- 
festaiion.s of going beyond ra- 
tionali/al Ion. The only lavr 
now in Central liuzon is the 
law of the gun. 

Cli.inilng to speak for the 
people, Taruc points out that 
05 i»er cent of them are the 
nia-^H*s, the working claas. 
But does he speak for all of 
tliem will n he speaks in effect 
of armed revolution? Is he 
credihle ivlieu he iiisijiuates 
that -Mrs. Quezon was the vio- 
tim of an .\meriean impt^ria- 
lij»t plot in conspiracy with 
their I'ilipino puppets? 

The people are uo dupes 
for propaganda regardless of 
who dishes it out. Tfie i>eople 
are imliiied to believe that 
vespoiisihie Huk lemters have 
nothing to do with the deadi 
of Mrs. Quezon. "Jliey are 
equally jiielincd to believe 
that the leaders of the consti-

hers she tried to fulfill through 
the Philippine National Red 
Cross, of which she was the

BO other worthy cause to which

This loss to the Filipino peo- 
ple is irreparable. She so en- 
sconced herself in the hearts of 
her countrymen that her death 
has left an aching void which 
has been made more painful by 
the manner of her demise. For 
her and her daughter to come to

her look of a woman of domineof- 
iiig character, her outbursts of 
temper, had a warm heart inside 
her... a big kind heart, which en- 
deared her to those who were 
fortunate enough to know her 
well. Very often with a sharp 
tongue, she however was a true 
and steadfast friend once she 
got to like you. She had few 
close friends, but the few she had 
each other. This, we have to ere 
her. 

A day for her meant meetings 
with her YLAC girls, visits to 
their schools, and by way .of re 
laxatioii, a game of bowling in 
the bowding alley she opened as a 
business venture in Quezon City, 

AVe have yet to see a family as 
' dose as the Quezons were to 
i each other, This, we have to cre- 
: dit to Dfia. Aurora, for as the 
raying goes “The hand that rocks 

• the cradle, rules the ' world”, 
j There were no pampered, - and 
1 spoiled brats in that family, each 
' cbmplcniented the ' other. It is 
'true that they had everything 
jiliey -wanted, ■ (well, almost for 
'what mortal being is ever fully 
■content?) and this because they 

deserved It, their illustrous fa- 

• ther saw ■ to that. This . is the 
'\ery reason behind Baby’s love 
■ for her Avork -with the Y'LAC. She 

realized that not all had the good 
fortune that was her lot, and that 
is why she tried to make theirs a 
better lot too. 

Knowing these w’e can under- 
‘■stand, the tension that gi-ipped 
tho.se at the funeral last Friday. 
Tlie YLAC felt cheated that they 
were not alloiyed to jparch behind 
her heai’se all the way from Spnto 
Tomas chapel to the NoaTh ceme- 
’ tery. For once this girls forgot 
their looks, they came with tear- 
stained faces, sans lipstick and 
powder. As the casket was be- 
ing placed inside the niche, \ve 
saw Conching Price, Gin Mata, 
Benjie Joseph and a host of others 
hurst unash an^edly into tears. 
What ^ moved as mo’st wa.s Lulu 
Ueyes* gesture of farew'ell to her 
beloved friend. As the casket was 
disappearing into the niche she 
held on to it for one long second, 
as if embracing a dear friend, 
podhye. For that was goodbye 


indeed.

Dna. Aurora gave dignity to her rank 


I F Prttidont Quezon had hit official family aolldly herded together, 
Mra. Quezon had the ladiee well-grouped in an ezcluaive circle that 
could have been the equivalent of the poet-liberation kitchen cabinet In 
well-eppointed partiea, Doha Aurora epitomized the dignity and charm of 
e true Firet Ledy in this land* In small private gatherings, like the few 

held in the privacy of the Palace (tocial hall, she also demonstrated that 
she could enjoy herself as much and as freely, without giving up any of that 
dignity. 

The informal group illustrated above, for instance, finds her in pigtails, 
puffed sleeves and baby undals, getting into the spirit of a costume play 

presided over by Jorge B. Vargas. 

It was a party that was thoroughly enjoyable without desecrating the 
sanctity of the people’s palace. There were few occasions the guests (includ- 
ing Blpidio Quirino, Antonio Vasques and Victor Buencaminio and Mesdames 
Osmefia, Quirino, Vargas, Valdes and Lus) enjoyed more afterwards*

Four constabulary companies 
were immediately dispatched to 
the scene of the ambush, the 88 th, 
90th, 91st and 2nd under the com- 
mand of Capt. Rafael Zagala. 
They pounded Huk positions in 
Mounts Tabernaculo, Butarero, 
Karunsu, and hills in the vicinity 
of the Angat, mines. 

As soon as the news of the am- 
bush attack on Mrs, Quezon’s 
party was known, the 89th com- 
i pany under Capt. Bonifacio Co- 
tong rushed from its station in 
San MigueT to the Bidacan-Nue- 
va Ecija border to plug any exit 
route which the murderers may 
utilize should they attempt an 
escape to the Sierra Madre moun- 
tains in Bulacan.

SHOCKING TRAGEDY 

MARCELO R. BOBIER, 7th Avenue, Grace Park, 
Caloocan. Rizal.— The ambuscade of Mrs. Quezon’s 
party between Nueva Ecija and Quezon by dissi- 
dents in which the illustrious lady and her daugh- 
ter “Baby” Quezon were among the murder victims 
is indeed shocking to the Filipino people. 
This tragedy will not only arouse the peo- 
ple with a feeling of resentment towards those 
who perpetrated (he crime; the people will also 
point accusing fingers towards the present admin- 
istration for its apparent inability to restore peace 
and order in the troubled areas in Central Luzon. 

Now that the ambuscade and the death of Mi‘s. 
Quezon and other high officials is a proven fact, I 
call upon the honorable officials concerned in the 
House of the Representatives and the Philippine 
Senate to stop their “apalachicola” and “guaracha 
show” and come out collectively and work for the 
problems that confront the newly born Republic.

CALL FOR TRUTfik 

JULIAN C. CARGULLO, UM, ManUa.— The re- 
cent tragedy in Quezon Piovince is an indignant 
answer of “No!” against President Quirino’s de- 
claration that peace and order reigns in the countiT 
today. Was Governor Chioco wrong and PC CJhief 
Alberto Ramos right when both gave their ver- 
sions on the nation’s peace and order problem at 
one time? Let the truth prevail above all else. 
Let the country’s leaders understand that the peo- 
ple demand a clear-cut report which though pain- 
ful to tho# concerned for political prestige do not 
give tragic results. It is high time that all “white- 
washings,” “railroadings,”’ “puppetry” and “optim- 
istic signs” must stop otherwise the people will con- 
tinue suffer.

yesterday on the drive against | 
the killers of Mrs. Quezon. Chio- 
co was understood to have given' 
his views for the successful pro- 
secution of the campaign. It will 
be recalled that the governor won 
renown during the occupation as 
a guerrilla colonel. 

Chioco wired President Quirino 
yesterday of the offer of some 


morning to Uie scene of the am- 
bu.scade and retunied to Manila 
Saturday night. He told the Eve- 
ning News this morning that his 
men expect a decisive encounter j;

He revealed that all available 
men of the organization were j 
massed on the Sierra Madre moun-

ed to the place today, it was said.

closed that it was definite that the 
Huks that killed Mrs. Quezon and

Meanwhile, as seasoned PC and

massed at the Bongabon-Baler 
sector awaiting word for the final 
push against the dissidents, Gov. 
Juan r. Chioco, in an intendew 
in his office in Cabanatuan, rei-

Villareal noted that several

their “over-exercise” of press

The CUFA chairman cited 
publication of letters of Luis

which shifted blame for the mas-

Quezon and 11 others from his

bandit charged with multiple 
murder. Anyone who deals with 
him, even by way of receiving

and abetting a criminal in elud-

it fell down a sheer 30 -meter pre- 
cipice, with not a row of tooth-

experienced mountain-climber mo-

And now we were in the sad, 
desolate place where raking Huk 
gunfire Thursday morning had 
snuffed out the lives of 12, in- 
cluding that of the country’s most 
beloved woman lational figure. 

We had hardly a view of the 
place in the fading daylight — an

woods and ravines around and 
tree-crowned knolls pushing into 
the clouds. Exgept for “upstairs” 
you could hardly see more than a 
hundred yards in any direction — 
and “upstairs” was a good direc- 
tion to look at, with the thoughts 
we had in mind.

No Political Slant 
In Tragedy -NP Head 

Former Senator Eulogio Rodri- 
guez, president of the Nacionalis- 
ta party, who was out of town 
when the (news of the tragic Que- 
zon ambuscade took place, urged 
restraint upon all political groups 
and asked them not to make po- 
litical capital out of the incident. 

He said; 

“Those who knew Mrs. Quezon 
could not have wished that great 
Lady any harm. To the people, 
she symbolized everything that 
1 was orderly generous and good. We 
in the Nacionalista par ty, in com- ^ 
t mon with the entire Filipino peo- 
; pie, share with the world the loss 
of a noble woman and a treasured 
I name.’' -

It seems that everyone would wash his hands of 
the blood in the terrible tragedy that was the mas- 
sacre of the Quezon family and their companions in 
Bongabon, but the guilty cannot escape the wrath 
of our people. The Huks as well as the government^ 
which should both bow their heads in shame for the 
outrage, have lost as much as the people’s loss in 
Mrs. Quezon’s death. Mrs. Quezon had already serv- 
ed the country fully, although she was serving more. 
This world could not ask more of her. On the other 
hand, the government has lost prestige and even res- 
pect, while the Huks haVe lost much ground in their 
avowed endeavor to improve the lot of the peasants. 
Even the peasants condemn the atrocity in Bonga- 
bon. Even to further their own end, they would not 
countenance the sacrifice of innocent victims, much 
less of Mrs. Quezon, who was their benefactress. 

The people eagerly awaited what Luis Taruc, 
the Hukbaiahap chief, would say on this matter. The 
Huks were given the benefit of the doubt. Even the 
chief of the Constabulary did. He could not believe 
the Kuks perpetrated the assassination. ‘‘The Huks, 
too, loved Mrs. Quezon,” said General Ramos. “They 
must have been plain bandits. They robbed.” 

When evidence indicated that the perpetrators 
were actually Huks, the people again gave them 
more leeway. They said “it must have been a mis- 
take.” Was it? Or have some of the Huks become 
so callous that they can no longer dissociate person- 
fisifies from institutions? This is the question that 
Lars Taruc must answer. If the slayers of Mrs. Que- 
zon were Huks, Taruc must disown them and hunt 
thsm clown as plain bandits. For one thing, as Taruc 
himself has admitted, they have murdered one who

Mrs Quezon has instilled fear in the hearts of the 
people, fear of the ruthlessness of the Hukbaiahap

then Taruc cannot expect them to rally to him as 
he does not expect them to rally to the side of the 
reactionaries. The people will assert themselves and
