Sueb a breakclown is inevitable if we are unable to 
obtain su flieirnt spaee to ship esseniial ear^roes arross 
I he Pacilie. 

Tw^o possible ways of oAeiemiiin?[ this acute shipping 
shcntage are obvitms. ns Adtniral Land jioints out. One 
is the substantial au^mentatitHi of the Ann^rit an nuMihaiit 
Oeets serving tho Comnumwealth : the oLher is an im- 
mediate increase in Philipiiirie'flag tnmuige through eon- 
sliueti<jn or j>ureliase abrtiad, Thv Achnhal gives us 
encouraging assurance tjf the ]>rogress being made in the 
program sn]>ply new, s[)eedy and eeonomiral ships to 
America's half-dti/rn trans- Pari fie lines. The trtmble is 
that this new tonnage nun not be available in time to save 
l^hilippine ecmimny from ruin. 

Our priiieipal dope of relief, tlven. is in the second 
course — an immediate increase in i*hilippine-nag ship- 
ping through construelion av jnirebase abroad. In this 
matter the I tiitiMl Slates Maritime (^<inuiiission has been 
unable to help us, despite an obvhmsly sincere attempt 
to do what il could, licfause of the contingencies of a 
confused world-wide shortagt* of sea-going vessels, the 
Commission refTntly has deelined to permit the transfer 
of Anieri<'an vessels t<v l^hili]>pine registry, taking the 
stand I mistaken, wo feel I that such transfers would 
deplete the I nited States' ow-n merchant fi^^el and tonnage 



reserves for possible wartinie use Vt"e are confident, how- 
ever, that the Maritime Connnission will solve the Fhilip- 
jiine shipping problem as part of its general effort to 
strengthen national defense in this vital lieid. Admiral 
Land's frank message strengthens that belief- 

Until 1946, the Philippines constitutes America's main 
outpost in the Pacific, For that reason, enlightened self- 
interest dictates that the I nited States keep the Islands 
constantly prepared. A nation threatened by serious 
economic and social trouble, as the Couunotiwealtli ahno^t 
eerlainlv will be if the shipping shortage is not speedily 
alleviated, is at a disad^'antage in building its defenses. 
EfTorts bv the Maritime Connnission to give us every 
faoilitv for the exchange of goods promote not only 
Philijipine interests, but American as ^velL 

Natiirnal interest is n<it jeopardized by the transfer of 
American tonnage to Philippine registry, \cssels (lying 
our flag, while under Insular law- are indisputably subject 
to the jurisdiction and control of the United States Gov- 
ernment in time of emergency, lo the same extent that 
ships of American registry are. Thus, your Administration 
is sacrifu-ing nothing fundamental when it authorises the 
transfer of 10 or 12'hadly needed steamers to the Philip- 
l>ine flag. 

The belief that the Philippines somehow is no longer 
part of the I n i ted Slates is widespread but erroneous. The 
actual facts are quite to the * i>ntrary. as the excellent 
article bv Assistant Secretary of the Interim- Oscar L. 
Chairman in the February issue of PHILIPPINES demon- 
strated. Our ships, w4iich for conversational purposes 
arc described as '^under the Philippine flag." in fact fly 
the Stars and Stripes aliove our ow^n colors. Basically 
even more significant, how^ever. are the close ties that 
exist between your government and ours. We have the 
same objectives: our pco[>le have the same ideals. Every 
dement of rhilippine^Amcrican relations points to but 
one conclusion: our resources— human and materiah men 
and gold and shii>s— are at Americas disposal in time 
of etnergencv. 

The inability <jf our [leople-^even our government- 
owned corporations— lo l>uy Amcriran ships when they 
are most needed is a temporar) pheiiomemm. just as 
the basic shortage of United States tonnage is. Admiral 
Laud's statement on the outlook b>r our sbipiuns, ex- 
porters and fanners is em tm raging, therefm e. The legal 
complications that iuive made the transfer of sbi]>s often 
diflicult in the past are n«)w^ feeing wnrked out: perhaps 
a srdution will ba\ e been reac hed 1>> the time this issue 
of PlllMPPlNES af) pears. \Vhatc\cr the outcome, we 
are confident ihat the Maritime Connnission doos not 
intend to overlocik Philippine needs in its [d aiming. ^

FRANK MURPHY'S PLACE 
IN PHILIPPINE HISTORY 

By Julius C» Edel stein 



It was 0\GE said (»r Asst»cinle Justice Franeis Mur- 
]jh\ of the Siipirnu* Court that he had found Irehind in 
tlie Pliilippines. That was a rather ha]i[jy remark, because 
it exactly e[)itoruized the rclationslnp that existed and 
exists even tof!a\ hetwcen Mr, Justice Mur}>ln — "itie 
Governor" tt» his FiIi[>ino friends — and the rM\ili|ipiiie 
peojjle. 

The descri]>t itiTi is ai>t hecanse the relationship hetween 
"^Governor" Murphy and the Pliili]} pines is rniR-h more 
than a mere temporal interlude in tlie career of the one 
and in the liisttJr\ of the <itlier. ll was and is hound up in 
the emotions, with ^ener<ms amounts tjf mutual appreeia- 
linn. It is hound uj) with Go^crm^r Mnrpln^s acquaintance 
with and irs tense interest in the histtnieal struggles of the 
Irish peop[e. It is a mcaniuiiful expression of the fact 
that he felt ln^ had h>nnd a similar peo[)le in the Far East. 

Mr, Mur[>liy. altlnm^h el(^\atetl to the augtisl might 
of the Supreme C!cmrt hcnch, remains today actively 
interested in tlie l^liili[>[>ines. with whose history he was 
so profotmdiy associated as the Islands' last Govermn* 
General arid first American High C^mnnissioner. His 
]>ersonal c(U i'esp<mdencc imd coirlacts still tndny reflecl 
his peisistcnl concern with liiili[}pine allairs and with 
Filipinos. 

Frank Murphy governed through one of the most his- 
toric pliases of Fhili[>j>inc- American relations, the tran- 
sitioii from Ameiiran ]>tJssession to senii-so> ereign Com- 
monwealth status: and the full im[)act of that transition 
was understood arul expressed hy Mr, Murph) as hy few 
Aniericairs, Dining Ids [)t>rit>d c^f ofllcp he lent major 
encouiagement to the l^ilipinos' diive for sovereign gov- 
ernment and gave a grtM^n light tt) Filipino elfitrts which 
culminated iji the sut-cessfnl creation t>f the Common- 
wealth. 

Because of tilts ami man) more personal reasiJiis. Fill- 
j)inos have watched with ]>ride the upward march of '"the 
Governor", ever since he left Manila oji May 11- 1936 
to heeonie suecessively, within the space of four years, 
Gtyvernor of the state of Michigan. Attorney General of 
the United States, and iinalh Asso< iate Justi(T of the 
Supreme Courts 

AihI today, as he sits in tlic hushed light of tlic majestic 
Supieine C<Jin l t handuT. fHi|iinns think of him as one 
of their own, I I is atlainment of the supreme judicial 
honor tliey consider a new j iistification of their Ijelief 
tliat the Fhilippiocs has [Waved a peculiarly historic role 
in the hisl<ir\ of America in pre]>aring a series of great 



leaders for American ]>uhlie life. But in the ease of Jus- 
tice Murphy, the feeling of Filipinos is much beyond the 
mere pride of recognition. It involves the whole history 
of their mutual asstK iatioii. 

Vi'hen high-principled young Mayor Murph\ ^vas sent 
to the Philii>t)ines as Governor General iti June. 1933, 
the first under the New Deal Filipinos wondered what 
sort of an administration they were in for. and wliat 
understanding the> migiu expect from a mid westerner 
who suppfisedly knew little of the ho[ics and aspirations 
of an island people 10,000 miles across the western sea. 

But in the PhiIi]>fnJTes Frank Murphy seemed to ha\ e 
ftumd a kindred i>ei>ph\ a folk whose aspirations he 
seemed to compreiiend with more than an inteUeclual 
appreciation. He seemed to have a feeling for their age- 
old struggle for freedom and equality - and for the sense 
of personal digtiily that goes with itu^ependenee, It was 
exacth in that sense that Murphy ^"discovered Ireland in 
the Phili[)pines,'' 

In American politics. Murphy was credited with lun- 
ing heen a liheral New Dealer hmg heftn-e the New Deal, 
In a iDcriod of unprecedented social ferment, unemplov- 
ment. and industrial dc|Hession the strong voice of Mayi>r 
Murphy Detroit called out hu' the assumption of 
responsihility hy the state and mi t ion for the welfare of 
those left johless by the depression. 

As Chief Executive of the Philif^pine Government, 
Murphy renuiined a New Dealer, His |>hilosoph\ <^f gov- 
ernment jibed perfectly with the loueepts of .social 
justice prevailing among Fili[Hno leaders, the juost prtnni- 
nent of whom was Sejiate President Manuel Quezon, sotm 
to become the first President of the Philipidne Cnrn- 
mo M wealth. 

iMurpIn advocated and signed legislation ftu Iv phoon 
relief, recognizing for the first lime the ruiticmal res[)onsi- 
hility for victims of s^>cial disaster. He urged slum tdea!"- 
a nee and low cost housing for the poor long before that 
ideal had become a connuonly accepted national pn^- 
gram in the I tiited States, The crusading voting Gcner- 
nor General strengthened Insidar (i nances, mainlaiueil a 
strictly balanced budget, took a stand against pork- barrel 
appropriations, and in general bro tight to a close the 
period partial American control of internal Phili[)pinc

Admiral Eiiiiirv S. Liiiiil 



CHAIRIVIAN 
U. S. MARITIME 
COMMISSION 



Foreign trade routes linking the I nited States with 
the rest of the world are vital to the welfare of this nation 
in times of peace as well as of national eniergcney. These 
marine arteries stretching out to many parts of the world 
must be kept open. Were certain essential raw materials 
cut off for lack of marine transportation, it is not an 
exaggeration to say this nation's contirmed existence 
might be in jeopardy. 

One of these highly essential life-lines is the trans- 
Pacific. Serving as a sort of huh in this transportation 
wheel of the Pacific are the Philippine Islands, which 
todav rejjresent our fifth best overseas customer, with a 
foreign trade aggregating approximately 830(),000,0()0 
per annum. From the Philippines we import vast quan- 
tities of hc!7ip, chromite. manganese, coconut oil and 
sugar worth nhnui .S9().000,0()(). To them we export better 
than .SUKKOOO.OOO worth of canned milk, cigarettes, 
machinery, flour, meat and other products of American 
farms, mines, forests, and factories, destined both for 
Filipino consumers and our military and naval forces 
stationed in the Far East. From these facts it is obvious 
that ihr Philipjjine trade route is essential to both Amer- 
ican commerce and defense. 

Nevertheless, trans-Pacific ship|)ing at present faces a 
critical lest. Losses of foreign vessels to normal trade — 
through sinkings, acquisition by armed services, con- 
centration in the all-important \orth Atlantic service, 
and the laying-u)) of sizable Danish and other foreig.n 
flag fleets — have resulted in a space shortage and con- 
sequent rate increases. Shipj)ers of several low-value 
rommodilies stored in many Far Eastern warehouses are 
finding difficult) in obtaining ship space at rates that 
w ill allow the cargo to move. 

The Far East Conference of New York, one of the 




Afliiiiral Emory S. Laii<l 

three big grou|)s of ship o|)<'ralors in ihc Irans-Pacilic 
service, in formed the Mariliinc C^oinmissioii early in 
March that, as a result of tin* rcquisilioniiig of tonnage 
by belligerent gov cinniciils. several niend>er lines luul 
become entirely dependent upf)n cbarttM-ed \ i'sst*ls. L'lilcss 
freight rales coubl be niaintain<'(l at a reniuneralix e level, 
it contfMidcfl. these liru^s might Ix* forced to abandon their 
services. 

Any sur h curtailment of ser\ ic<» would, of cours(% prove 
detrimc*nlal to Philippine trade. W itlidrawals would cause 
not only a shortage of needed AnuM icati goods, hut would 
reduce the nund)er of <lii|)s axailabb* for exports of 
Philippine sugar, copra. Manila filxM* and other staple 
pnjducts to th(» I nitcfl Stales. 

The incn^ase in rates for elKui<'red \ (^ssels, as well as 
in the freight rates since the outbrcvik of the war, had 
reflc^f ted increased costs of (q)erali<Mi. Expenses for wages, 
fuel, stevedoring, n^pairs and war risk insiiratn-e (»n hulls 
are all higher today than in ri\v\\ Voyages in many 

cases are greatly leiigtheiKMl b\ wartime r(\uulal ions, while 
delays <jften are oecasicnied by eong(*slion in drydocks and 
repair yards. 

In the Far East, as well as in othiM- trades, crews must 
be paid war bonuses in addition to r(»gular wages. These 
added expenses can be offset onl\ through increased 
freight rates. Therefor(\ iIk^ n|)war(l tendency, although 
constantly scrutinized l>\ the Maritime Cionunissiou and its 
|)ivisi()ns of Emergenex Shipping. Operations and TralTie, 
and R(*gulati(»n. is largtd\ intnilaide. Of course* the 
scarcil) of sliips is also responsible for increases, es- 
pecially in charter rati's.

eight new l2.(K)0-tnn freighters (Operating within 18 
months. Each of these new ships, as it enters regular 
service- w ill strengthen trade ties between the L nited 
States and the Philip [unes. 

The Maritime Commission is ever-mindful oi tiie 
importance of unliampercd trade with the Connnonwealtli 
of the Philippines and is determined that these sea lanes 
shall be kept open. Chr< unite and manganese are strategic 
cargoes. Manila hemjj is likewise vital. These connnod- 
ilies nmsl reach our shores without hindrance. Philip- 
pi!ie sugar, which accounts for 15 percent of America's 
needs, is on the list of important cargoes. And we must 
not forget our SI ()O,()0(ltKK)'a-\ car export trade with the

Approximately a^ooo miirs souihwosi of Seattle 

is America's westernmost naval outpost, the Phili|>pines. 
These islands are the home base of our famous Asiatic 
Fleet and contain our navy yard, naval air station and 
naval reservation. In the records of the Navy, the Philip- 
pines constitutes the lOth \aval District of lht» I riited 
States. 

Il is to he rememl)ered that these same Islands are the 
subject of a solemn compact under which Congress agreed 
to give them full political independence on July I, 1916. 
That date is now five \cars away. Hut until that time we 
inevital)l\ retain th(» responsibility of defendii.g the 
Philippines against all enemies, just as we are obliged io 
defend the soil of California or Maine. Our naval out- 
post is one instrument for thc^ discharge of that inescaj)- 
able responsibility. 

From a longer range \icwpoint it is also our obligation 
--and indeed a ?H^<"cssil\ of national policv to make the 
Philippines reafl\ to defend its own national inleuritv and

These hvo oh] i ■rations are ivrimardy eliariiod to the

be the lonlrul fai ls of mir ]>oliey toward llie Phili|iinnes, 
situated as it is on one frini^t' of I lie world i onilagration.

and no anHiiinl of uisliiriir ran flivesi as 
uf the j'es[jons}hiliiy for defendinsi i>ur

On the other hand ll would seem lo 
the best interests of our national |iolie\, 
not only to take vdiatever sle])s are wise 
and necessary to slrenglhen onr nwn 
defensive forees, but also to j>re]>are the 
Filipinos themselves lo assume a grad- 
ually ini^reasing share uf the fu net ion of 
defense. We mtist eerlainly eoojierale in 
their pre[)arali<ms eventually to assume entire respcmsihil- 
Ity for their ov\^n national preservation. 

We in the Vnited Stales tiave taken ihe stand that we 
M'ill assist any Jialion whieh resisls aggression. That is 
the meaning of "'arsenal of deuKieraey". We are es- 
pecial ly interested, it goes without saying, in keeping 
true denioerai'ics from dominalion and enntrol hy greedy 
totalitarian neighbors. Every free denit^rraev is another 
bul wark for I he defense of I he L iiited Slates* 

The Philippines, when it becomes independent, will be 
such a Indwark. Throwing the Filipinos to a totalitarian 
ncighbtjr would deprive ourselves of Elie physical eomfoi t 
and support of 16.000,000 people who share our politi- 
cal ideology, our governmental forms and cnltural in- 
stitutions, and who have been 40 years learning lo esteem 
demoeraey and its values. It would also meaii handing 
over to a potential enemy the many essential and stra- 
tegic resources with which the Conunon wealth ahonncis. 
Resources that now flow into our markets on a commercial 
basis would lie forcibly controlled for an eventual offense 
against oiir essential interests, even against our shores. 

This theoretical discussion comprises the background 
for a rather small but highly signifreanl hill Avhirh ihe 
House of Representatives has already passed, and which 
is awaiting action in the Senate. This measure, approval 
of whi*h I was glad lo urge when it was in ihe House, 
w^ould authorize the Secretary of the JNavy to sell U* S. 
naval equipment to the Philippine Commonwealth at cost. 
It would also aulht^rize hnn to ]}erf..rm certiiin services 
for the (^nnnumweallb and for its incipieut naval estab- 
lishment. 

The significance of such a measure derives dirertlv 
from rhe larger cirrumstances described alvove. rather

I ban from its legislati\ e provisions. The iiieasnre. in its 
execution, mereh conhibnles to a general policy. 

The bilk H.R, 2107, was introduced by Rep. Carl 
Vinson, Chairman of ihe House Xaval Affairs conmiittee. 
at ihe request of the .\avy De^jartment. Largely drafted 
by nav)' legal experts in consultation with the OtViee of 
the Resident Cotnniissioner of t!ie Philip- 
pines in Vi'ashington. it aulhorizes the 
Secrelary lo: 

1. Sell materials. sup|dies. and equip- 
ment lo the Conniion^^eallli goveni- 
menl; 

2. Repair or assist with the design i^f 
vessels- armament or equipment for the 
Commonwealth in such amounts as the 
I tnted Slales na\al eslaldishment may 
lie in a posilioi^ to do: 

3. Fix ihe cost lor suclt supplies, 
equipment and services: the ]>rice for 
new supplies lo be not less than the 
original cost to the L niled States goN ern- 
ment. 

Contracts under the authority in this 
bill must contain the following restric- 
lions : 

L The Philippine Government utidertakes not to dis- 
pose of any materials, supplies, or designs to any third 
government under any circumstances: 

2. The authority for sueh sales and services lapses 
upon the final granting of independence to the Philip- 
pines. 

Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox< in submitting the 
proposed legislation to Congress, wrote to Speaker Sam 
Raybuni that ''the enactment of the proposed legislation 
would place the Navy Deparlnient mi an equal fooling 
with the War Department, so far as rendering assislance 
lo the Commonwealth of the Philippines wlien such 
action is deemed advantageous lo the pxd^lic interest. 

In actual execution, this authority will make it possible 
for the Navy to make available to the Filipinos suflicient 
equipment and supplies for a small off-shore patrol, con- 
sisting mostly of small 'Q " boats, equipped with tor- 
pedoes. Such deals, wdiile possible now^ must be routed 
through the War Department, a time-consuming arrange- 
ment. 

Naval training for Fili[nrio seamen and the experience 
of operating a miniature fleet, even if il is onl) a coastal 
patrol, will go far toward strengthening the national 
morale. In ihe end_ il will pro^ id(^ the ruicleu-^ of a Fili- 
pino Navy. 

At the same time — whal is more inqjortarU for toda\ - 
it will provide a small force which may be of in\alnalde 
assistance in ihc inmiecliafe de\eIiqTmenl ol ihc defense 
problems of the Phi]ipi)ines. Such a small force, a: - 
quainted with ihe channels and watery passag.^- oi the 
archipelago, might easily prove of incahadahle assislance 
to Ajuerican na\al forces in the patrrd of this vast area 
of the Philippines. In an emergcricv il is conreivabfe lhat 
such Ll fnrce miglu prove decisive. ^

BEHIND THE SCENES IN MANILA 



DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING 
YOU READ IN THE PAPERS 
IS THE ADVICE OF 

JAMES ROSS 



Too many American newspaper correspondents are 
niaking the long voyage to Manila in vain the&e days, to 
my way of thinking. Judging by the recent outbreak of 
'^behind-the-scenes" articles, literary visitors to the capital 
of the ambitious, young Commonwealth lay the founda- 
tion of their knowledge in the pleasant patio of Manila's 
fine hoteL talking to hospitable residents of th': "Pearl 
uf the Orient'' who, in the words of Artemus Ward, 
"'kiiow a lot of things that just ain't so.'" Almost without 
exception, these writers have turned their indisputable 
fact-finding talents to a job of muck-raking that could 
have been done just as well in Kansas City. They get only 
a glimmer of the real significance of an experiment in 
government that in time may prove more important to 
the American people than the outcome of the war in 
Europe. 

I have 110 wish to engage in acrimonious argument. 
XeverEhelesSj I can see no contribution to a righteous 
solution of one of the United States' most difficult pro- 
blems in the publicising of inaccuracies and ill-considered 
conclusions. 

One writer, for instance, claims that all Filipinos "hate 
Americans,'' I went to the Philippines mtjre than 40 
)ears ago as an officer in the United Stales Army. Our 
troops remained in the Islands after the Filipinos felt 
we bad done a praiseworthy job of liberating them from 
Spain and might reasonably be expected to go home. 
The Filijjincjs nuule a determined, if futile, attf^mpt U) 
ejert us. r'hartK terixed b> the display of no mean fighting 
qualities. The ensuing unpleasantness did indeed give rise 
to a certain cimouni of ill-feeling. But I insist that Amer- 
ic-^ans are not hated today. 

EstafilishmeiU ai civil go\fM'nment in 1002 won the 
wbtdeliearted rot^jcralion Filipinos of all classes, 
including niain (mtslanding leaders of the tev(;lt against 
S[jaiji and the subsequent insurrectir)n against the United 
States. Certainly no armed conflir t. even between ]ie(jples 
<*f ihe same race, ever was frjlhiund by less ranr-or. 

I he Filipinos are a kindh peofde. courtefais to stran- 
g^ rs anfl to ea* b uthet. htjspilablc to a fault, and rerep- 
ti\e In .^o( ial. |>fililiral and economic inrinvati<tns whirh 
appPLvr to I in fur ihcii- benefit. Fducation along modern 
American lin(*s has Ih-vm eauerl\ and gratefully received. 
The spread of I lie I'jiiilisii hni^nage lhrf>u«hont the 



anhi]jelagij has becji nulhing les?^ ihuo phenomenal. 

It is true — as recerU writers ha\e re[>c*rt{^d — that social 
conditions in the Philij)[jioes are iiot ejUircK satisfaetorv 
and that the lot of the tab<>rer is not wholly bap[jv. But 
living standards are infinitel) higher than an) where else 
in the Orient and superior to those ]jre\ ailing in many 
parts of pre-war Europe, llie Fili]>inois are the first to 
proclaim this improvemfTU in iheir ^^pirilual and material 
welfare in the past 40 years. Hrcausi^ uf ihrse ad\ance- 
ments, high hopes have been built for tlie fuhire. Whelher 
these hopes are to be fulfilled depends upon continued 
American interest in Philijqvine affairs. 

Seven years ago Congress Mtit^d ttj t ut th<^ tie^^ biridin^^ 
the Philippines to the United States. While the Tydings- 
McDnffie Act may have been applauded in 193 k it wiis 
not of a character to insure the continued gr>odwi11 of 
the Filipino people. 

A highly placed Filipino onee told me that the so- 
called Independence Act, while it might at first be hailed 
as a measure of eniancipalitoi. wrtuld in the end leave 
the Filijnno people with an abiding resentment against a 
country that had given ihem merely the illusion of free- 
dom. I believe this prediction is accurate. The Tydings- 
McDuflle Act in its present form is an instrument of in- 
justit'C. Before it is hio late, the law should be subjected 
to the ^'realist ie le-exainimition'' prtjpo^cd Iiy former 
United States Migh Commissioner Paul \\ McNutt. 

U is nt*t my purpose iu appear a:^ the advocate of 
Mi\ MeNutt's pro]3osaL The matter, nevertheless, merits 
ihougbtful consideration at a time when everUs may soon 
make decisive at tion necessary. Whatever ina\ he dune 
about the political provisions of this legislation, lis 
economic conditions shoukL on elementary ininriples of 
justice, he subjected to radical revision.

Filipino stalesjnen and writers have long ajiprecialed 
their ties to the Latin American repubtics. President 
Manuel Quezon's "good will"' visit to Mexico in 1937 \s

soeiation between statesmen of the Philippines and those 
of the American Kepuldics. The Philippine Coniinon- 
weahh must soon undergo a period of diplomatic appren- 
laesbip preparatory to complete inde]>endence. Filipinos 
should have the opi>ortunily to attend Pan-American con- 
ferences. Their Resident Commissioner at Vi asliinglon 
should be ijjvited to attend sessions of the go\ erning board 
of the Pan-American I'nioiu at least as an oliser\ er. 
Young Filipinos should be attached to I nited States Em- 
bassies or Legatitjus in Latin American capitals for prac- 
tical experience in international relations. 

Third, cononerce between the I'nited States and the 
soon-todK*-born Philippine Republic should not be en- 
visaged as eonipetitive with Latin Ameriean trade. The 
Philippines should be regarded as rightfully entuled 
through long association and conuuon interest to share 
whatever liberality or reciprocity the ''Gi)od Neighbor" 
policy may im]jly toward the American Republics. 

It is true that some Philippine [uoducts- ]3arti(*ularl\ 
sugar, compete with Latin American jM'oduets in our 
nuiikets. but experience has shown that all |uirties bene- 
tii hy a common adjustment of rivali ies through market- 
ing programs and a pi aimed di\ersification of products. 
If L ncle Sam looks to the American Republics as brothers- 
it is cqualh true thai the Pbili|>pines was long a foster 
son and ward, and consequentK ejiiiiled to family treat- 
ment. 

Trade experts will take note, too, that, with the tre- 
mendous geographical re-dislribul ion of Asiatic coni- 
merce, the Pliilippines may have a new role as inter- 
mediary in Far Easterii business. Histor) reminds iis I hat 
the silver dollar became the t iirrenc) of Chiim and great 
parts of Asia as a direct consequence of Uie early ties 
between Mexico and Manila. 

In a strictly personal sense, an) fair-nun ded observer 
would concede that the Filipino |:Cijple are qualified for 
membership in a ''good neighbor" cnnummity. Their 
]jrominent traits are hospitality, generosity and adapt- 
a[>ility to cosmopolitan soci(4\. Ml llcsiflent (jnnmission-

It is axiomatic that few FUipinos come to the United 
States to stay. Most want merely to study; many are 
anxious to learn American production methods; a few 
like only to traveL Almost without exception, every 
Filipino looks forward to the day when he can return 
to the Commonweahh and live again among his own 
people. 

This fact was an element in a strange paradox that 
came to an end December 3L 1910. That paradox was 
the almost complete failure of the Filipino Repatriation 
Act of 1935. 

On Jidy 10, 1935. the President of the United States 
approved H.R- 6464, ''an Act to provide means by which 
certain Filipinos can emigrate from the United States/' 
Popularly called the Repatriation Act, it specified 
Hiroadly ^ that any Filipino in the United States was 
entitled to repatriation at the expeiise of the Government, 

''It is recognized that there are a great number of 
Filipincjs in the L nited States whose removal to the 
Phiii]jt[)ines would be to their advantage and to the ad- 
vantage of the communities in which they now reside,'' 
the Commissioner of Immigration and \aUna!izatfon 
Service reported at the time the measure was being con- 
sidered, ^'The Filipino ran not he removed unless he 
makes applitatioji for such benefit. He is not to be con- 
sidered as if ileported . . . 

The House Committee on Innnigration and Naturaliza- 
tion Service estimated that 20.000 to 30,000 Filipinos 
would apply for re]>atriatiou. But on the day the act ex- 
jjired. an]}- 2.190 Filipinos had accepted free transporta- 
titjn to Manila, 

W hat caused this surprising upset r^f all oflicial expecta- 
tions Adniilledly. the Repatriation A<'t was a boon to 
nuui\ FilipiiNis in the I nited Slate^^. The rr^rjjiomic crises 
of 1929 and 19"^2 had thrown ihousancls of ihem out of 
enifjio) niejiL Hundreds Iie^ anie destitute, depeiulent upon 
pri\ate or pul)lir^ cliarity. Passagr? nt the PhiUppine In- 
defif^ndenrr Act in 1931' aggravated their already deplor- 
able condittiMi l>v fostering a misc<»nception f>f I heir legal 
*^talns, Americans, reading that the i'hilipfjincs had 



adopted its owjj Constitution and elected a Presidejit, be- 
lieved the Cunmion wealth had be(:<?rnc an independent 
country and that Filipinos, therefore, wrre aliens. Citizen- 
ship was made a requirement for em [)lcj\ jn<'nl in niLiny 
lines, and "non-citizen" Filipinos were laifl idl. 

One Mould think tliat lhi>usarids of Filipinos, without 
employment and faced by slarvalion. uonld ]>rfnnptly 
apply for free transportation to Manila under the Fle- 
patriation Act. Yet, records of the Immigration Service 
show that in 1936 only 157 availed ihcinseh t^s of the 
privilege and in 1937 not nion^ tlian 526. 

The reason onlv a littln nuav llian oiii^ ti'nth of Uie 
estimated numl>er took advantage of tliis humanitarian 
law passed by ihe United States Government is easv to 
find. i\o matter by what sweet name it was ealled, the Re- 
patriation Act was considered by Filipinos to be a de- 
portation measure. Whoever availed himself td" its 
benefits was thereafter pointed lo as a faihire. 

Early repatriates, moreover, \serc instrmnrrUal in dis- 
eoura^fin^ others from returnini: undi^- the Ai L Uiisuited 
to life in the Island?^. disiliusj<jncd by unfuHillcd hopes 
of employment and disappoitjted Ijy shaUeretl dreams for 
a better life, ihey repeatedly admoni;^he<l thnst^ still in 
the United Stales not Ut returji htiuie without savitifijs and 
assured employment. The extensive publicity given to 
them in Manila u]ifin their arri\'al lis ''de[)or tees'' and 
''problem children" added Lo tin- avera^^e Filiphio's dis- 
trust of the well-meaning Repair iatirm AcL 

Adinittedly, of course, many repatriales, reunited ^vilh 
their families after years of separation, were hap]>y to 
be home again. Letters written by [jarents who had aljan^ 
doned hope of ever sceinn; their stms a^^ain indicated the 
priceless value of this humanitarian measure. And the 
resolutions sent to the Secretary of LalK>r liy rc[)atriates, 
expressing appreciation for the benefits extended by Ihe 
law and gratilude lo Immigration officials for their suc- 
cessful and pleasant jemrney to the Philippines, was 
significant. 

The real answer, however, lo the question of why fcM' 
Filipinfks returned under the Repatriation Art lios in the 
purpose for which most <d them cajn<> tc^ tiic United 
States. Their paramount motive was to biUler ibemselves, 
financially as well as intcHct tuall) , I f they have failed lo 
achieve their purpose, they prefer to remain in obscurity 
in the United .States: if stncessful. ihey would not risk 
their future in the Philippines with tin^ stiiz;ma of re- 
patriation. The re]>atriation way was the way of those 
who have faded, anrl every Fili[)ino wants tt^ be a snceess

which Ijcars thr naiiK^ Aurora, Inuiorini: (he Fir^l Lady 
of the Co ill 111 on weal ill. Mri^. Aurora AraiTiMi yuuzon. A 
woman of riirc i)ersoiiaI oharni and simple elegance, 
possessed of a kind heart and syintniLhelie nnderi^landinii 
that ha\'e endeared her lo the FHt pi no people, '"Dofia 
Aurora" has pirn.*ipntly (utiidnned lier duties as hostess of 
Maiacanan, as wife of ihr iirsl I'residt-nt of the Conmrnn- 
wealth, and as the nictliier u{ lliirc lo\rl\ children. 

Allh<ni^h Aiircna Arai^on \vas hirrn of vvi*ll-to-do par- 
ents in the town of Baler, Tayaha^^ Province, the euniisca- 
lion of their propcrt> liy the Spaidsh iri>\ ernnient during 
the revulnli<ui nii^ant hard work for the eiiihl children. 
The fatniiy livcfl in a one-rooni niim shack and slept on 
a bandicKJ floor eoviMed with native woven mat. Mrs. 
Quezon's childhood expcriemes serve<l her welL for shc 
not only iirKlerstandg the needs of tlu* ]>oor, hnt can help 
women leaders and govennnenl ofliciab ^^olve many of 
the social [irohlems \ A the roiuilrs'. 

Dcscrihing her t^irlhooif, the First I.ady once told a 
large group of labtjrers that she did what no young 
man or woman would do today — poiuid rice in cMidr 
wooden mortars, walk harcf<»ot and felcli water in earthen 
jai-s, do the family hnnidry, help eulti\ate vcj^etahlcs 
and sweet potatoes in the home lot. and plant rice in 
tiic muddy fields in rain and seonlnng heat alike. 

What little schooling: Dona Aurora had began when she 
learned the alpliahel from her aunt. Maruiel Quezon's 
mother. This was sujiplcnrented by two years in the 
Franciscan convent at Baler and two )ears at the Philip- 
pine Normal school, where poor heahh ]He\(^ntcd lier 
com plot iiig tlie regular course. Mrs. Quezon's inability to 
finish her formal studies uuidc her the more determined 
to improve herself. Keadin^i English, Spatiisli and Taga- 
log, she littilt up a library which today has more than 
2,000 vohimes, ri \\ in aneienl histciry m\A tales of the 
FiIi[)ino ]ieople.

details, Harrison had to cable back, liat is the name 
of the bride?*' 

The success of ihe nation-wide health rehabilitation 
niovenient, espeeiallv among the indig:ent. is attributed 
lo the persistent elTorts of Dona .\urora in impro\ iiig 
Filipino welfare. CI i rues, nurseries- diet kitchens- and 
child welfare centers are now established throughout the 
Phili]i]>ines. Provincial executives, inspired by ihe First 
Lady s interest in eonmiunity health and nursing- have 
taken u]> the eampaign for more hos|)itals. 

At the recent inaugnratior. of a hospital in a Sociidist 
province. Mrs, Quezon was guest of honor. She listened 
patient!) lo the Socialist mayor until he declared that the 
new hospital was only for the privileged. Dona Aurora, 
enraged at the allegation, stood up and firmly told the 
audience that the hnsinlal had been erected for all, 
irrespective of class. She received a thunderous ovatiiuK 

Even hefore she became hostess at Malacanan. Mrs. 
Quezon's name was a synonpii for humanitarian efTorts- 
and public health and nursing projects. Each Christ nias. 
hundreds of poor Manila children received money- food 
and clothing from Don a Aurora, She continues this 
philaitthropie work at Malacanan^ but on a greater scale. 
Her children now help in distributing these gifts. 

Mrs. Quezon helped found the Asociacion de Damns 
f'ilipinas in 1913. The organisiation now operates a settle- 
ment house for destitute women and children. Through 
her sponsorship and initiati\e, the Community Health and 
Nursing Association of Manila was foiuided. Because ^^f 
her treniendons ridluent^e over Filipino women, she is 
honorary j>resident o{ tnery important women's organi- 
zation in the Conmn^n wealth. 

In reeogaition id her efftu'ls tu improve piddic healllu 
Ihe Philijipine General Hospital's School of Nursing has 
awardec! her a dijilonia in nursinjr. She has also rccei\ed 
an honnrary degree of Doctor of Laws for humanitarian 
serv ice from Marygrove College, Detroit, i 1 03 ( I . the 
Philippine Women's University in January- lU-IO. atid the 
I riiversily of Sanio Tenuis in March. 1910. 

Table tetUHs with llie President is Mrs. Quezon's favor- 
ite indoor sport. The President loses many a game [o his

By Harry T. Frost 

J I ST after tht* turn of ihc fcntnry — alnn»sl before the 
Philijjjjine Insurrection had tMidcd--an aiiihitifuis < ity 
]>hui was drafted for Manila. As hroad rrew streets weie 
laid r)Ut ihroti^fh i\\v stdiurlis. fijif buildings were de- 
si^rneci to take ad^antu^e of the ijnproved \'istas. A great 
c'i\ ir reniiaiss;anee was predieted. The forecast was justi- 
fied; in U) years the population of Manila and its subinlis 
<jrew from 35f)J)0f) t<* well o\ef a million, and I lie IMiili])- 
]>ine capital d(^\eb>j)ed Into the juost l>eautiful citv in the 
Orient. 

Ikit th(* result was not what liad l>err\ ajUiripalinb 
truth \vas that Manila quickly outgrew itself. A new 
farther-reaching plan w^as necessary. We believe 
the answer is iji QiKV.on City. 

T\\v Olfl Manila that Admiral Dewt^y found In 
was situated on a narrow tongue of fiat delta land be- 
tween the muddy I^asig River and land-lorked Manila 
Bay* The c^a[)ital of today extends for five miles along the 
eastern short^ of the bay and irdaiid for another five miles. 
Behind Manila, a niih^ or two hack from the bay, the 
uplands of Central Luzon begin. The slope is gradual, 
aseciuling to a com[)aralively cool and dry [daleau with 
an altitude of ahoul 200 feeL The terrain is rugged in 
s|jots. Several streams have cut their wav through the 
fertile soil to the underlying volcanif^ rock, adding variety 
and interest to the eouirtryside, Tliis is llu^ site fjf Quezon 
Cit\. which in a few years is to take the plaee of Manila 
as the cafiiUil of the Philippines. 

Que/on City is no ( aj>i if ions monument t(^ the fir^t 
president of the C-onnni>n wealtln It is the result of a 
steady and insistent demand f()r space. The area could just 
as easily have ( oiuimied as a batch of un related suburbs, 
hut the natural iieauty of the irregular [daleau , high above 
Manila, suggeste<l a new, beUer planned, more beautiful

ing lots, and serious lack of t>peti space, Quo/^on City 
a new urlKin area plan net! in advanec to make Uvinir 
more ]}leasant. 

The artuai g<*ncsis of the idea was on a small scale. The 
uplands; wen* part of a serres of feudal land holdings 
which, even as late as 1935, were entirely undeveloped. 
One vast estale- — its kOOO acres oidy a nnle from tlie 
edge of Mantla — was bought by the government. Bridges 
were built and a low-cost housiuii development started. 
The idea of a haven for I he njider|n ivileged expanded 
into a dreatn of a city, and ihe cily willi groat iialaral ad- 
vantages blossomed into a new capital of the Conimon- 
weaUh, w itli ajnpie room ff>r ri<4i and }>nor. The hound- 
aries were made io encom}>ass many suburbs on tlie 
eastern edge of Manila. Quezcin Cily was born, 

Quexon City's area of 2^>() square miles is more than 
twice that of Manila, and the Government owns a third 
of the la tub Substantial areas have been set asick; for 
pu!>]ic fiuHdings, sc fiools. ]>arks. a new 1.2(K.)-acre campus

the center of Matnla to the Capitol site, a distance 
five miles. President Quezon laid the corner, tone of the 
Capitol building last Co nunun wealth Day, November 15. 
Other publie builduigs soon to follow are the city hospital 
and several pubUc markets in widely separated neighbor- 
hoods. Plans are being prepared for the Suprenie Court 
Building and the Executive Mansion. 

Many city planning opportunities present themselves 
in Quezon Cil} . not the least of which is the projection of 
new streets into old Manila. Quezon City is indeed a huge 
subarb. separated from Manila only by such open park 
spaces as can be acquired today. The new capital will 
inject new life into the bigger city. 

In a recent message to the Philippine National As- 
sembly, President Quezon summed up the program for 
[he new capital. 

"The rapidly increasing population of the eity of 
Manila." he declared, "and the highly unsatisfactory con- 
ditions in the districts where the laborers live have con- 
stituted a problem which for a long time needed attention. 
To solve this problem, as well as give impetus to scientific 
city planning, Quezon Citv has been created, adjoining 
Manila, and is now being developed into a model ctnn- 
numity," 

Manila is fortunate in that any discussion of the ad- 
\antages tu' disadx antages of urban decentralization is 
still academic. By comparison with an American city, it 
has few autumobiles and no radiating six-lane parkways. 
(-( nsequently, the urge to move ever fa^th'^^r into the 
suburbs is almost entirely lacking. Manila is sjiared the 
daih fil e oVlock rush of thousands of cars ab)ng jammt^d 
llnnoughfarcs. Th^-re are no sprawling subdiv isions, no 
no- man's- land of barhet ne buts. road houses and bilb 
boards. Manila, instead of Inoking forward Uy an old age 
nuuked In miles of abaJidtmed shuns and. as is the case 
in many A merit ait cities, declining pro)>erly values, 
contiijues its vigorous gnnvth as a center of connnerce 
arcl industry. It is this condition that Quezon City is 
designed to promote. ^

A POPULAR fiction Jiia-a/jne that 
thrives without advertising . . , a 
national En^rlti^h-language weekly in 
a cDuntry where Enjilish wa? vrrtn- 
ally unknown 40 years ago . . . ten 
publications under one loof . , . 

The largest puhlishtiifr eJUer[jrise 
in the Philippines, R anion Hnres, Tnc\, 
has performed journalist if feals that 
seem little short of miracles in most 
American editors. For instance your 
"puljjs" prosper without advf'it^sin^r. 
but ad-less Li nay nay h far from I ic- 
ing a pul]J publication, lo the con- 
trary, it holds a literary position 
comparable tsj Collier's or the Suliu- 
day Evening Post. 

Likewise, there luay seem to Ije 
nothing remarkable in an Enj^lish- 
language weekly edited by and foi^ 
FiIi|>ino5. But the Graphic makes a 
s[>eciahy of wcll-rfiundefL stafT-wriUf?n 
articles on Philippine and world af- 
fairs; it dramatizes the weekV news 
in a regular siij>j)lement after the 
fashion of Time and ycu .'m eeh: and 
it ]}u])lishes literar) works rjf sucli 
distinction that some of tlicjii hare 
found their way into A merit an an- 
thologies and magazines. 

Lastlv, it may be suggested that 
publication of ten magazities by one 
house aiiiounts to unccononiic d u pli- 
cation . Closer acquaintance with the 
special fields of the various Ramon 
Roces maga/^ines is neressary for full 
appreciation of their work. 

Luzon, the largest island of the 
Pbilip]>ines, has three great language 
groups. Tagalog, Ilocano, aiul Ricol. 
while two other important dialects 
are used in the Visa van islands to 
the south. To obtain anything re- 
sembling complete coverage, a pub- 
lisher obviously nuist use more than 
one medium. The weekly Li way way

serves the Tagalog-speaking belt of 
Central Luzojl Bannawag and Bikol- 
twn are read in the northern fllocosl

CRISIS 

. . . in the J^ltiLipptne Coconut SJn<iu6tttf 



By Ernesto D. llustre 



With copra prices aL the lowe.^L level in ^^^c decades 
and giving no promise of revivaJ. the PhiUppine coco- 
nut industry, the Islands^ second most impoilarit sourt^e 
of income, faces a crisis that means poverty to the more 
that 4,000,000 Filipinos \vho depend on it for a hvelihood. 
Late last falL growers in Laguna. Batangas and Tayahas 
Provinces- despairing of salvagijig their $225,000,000 in- 
vestmeni: and $35,000,000 annual trade- actually discussed 
cutting down their coconut trees and planting; food. 

The importance of the coconut industry to the Philip- 
pine economic structure is often overlooked. More than 
1*500,000 acres of land are devoted lo growing. Exports 
of coconut oil, copra, desiccated coconut and copra nieal 
had a combined value of 321,325,000 in 1939. Most im- 
portant of alL it is the poor man's induslry, since it 
takes a minimum of investment and skilK 

Coconut palms, which require about five years to reach 
maturity, continue to produce for about 30 years. Ripe 
coconuts are collected, split and spread in the sun, Wheji 
the meat can be removed from the shell, it is placed on 
a grid and smoked unlil dry. The product is copra. 

The crisis confronting Filipino copra producers — 
primarily the result of low prices — is made more difiicult 
by three contributing factors. These are the relatively 
inefficient methods employed in the Philippine copra 
industry: the closing European and olhei im]>ortant 
foreign nmrkels by the war; and the operation of re- 
strictive limitations on the entry of Philippine coconut 
oil into the Lnited States. 

In appraising tl^eir mounting troubles two years agO- 
Filipinti co( <nHit men were t^andirl enoagli to realize and 
admit they M'<juld have lo overhaul their wastefnl method 
of kiln-drying the cofunul 
meat if they wished to com- 
pete with other partt^ of the 
East Indies. They know that 
lieltei- r<ipra fetches a iictler

Whether such remedial stc[js at this late date can save

discounts amounted fco S59-ol3,500, an Increase of 
361 since November 30, 1935. The comparison of 
figures at the end of each calendar year since 1935 shows

Filipinos ha\e small incomes, with little incentive or op* 
]Mirt unity to save for a future trip home* To meet this 
jjrolilem^ several solutions have been suggested. One in 
[Kirticular — an arrangement whereby Filipinos could de- 
posit installment jjayments on their tickets to Manila with 
the office of the Resident Commissioner of the Philippines 
in WashintJ^ton — is now under serious study. Whatever 
decision is reached: however, efforts to promote repatria- 
tion must take into account the fact that Filipinos have 
always come to the l. nited States in search of educational 
and financial improvement, and that they are reluctant to 
accept a method fif return that smacks of poverty or

"As Free 
and Happy 
As Our Own" 

The Phjlij>j>iruf Residcjit (^<onmissioner 
Washington, D. C, 

Dear Sir: 

Tliank yon bir yonr jft*neroiis nfTr^r of a subsrri[)tinn 
to [MIlLIPPl.NES. I haslrMi In lak<* ad\anhm<' of it. 

I spent four r^f the happioi v<^ars uf tin life in Mitida* 
nao and the Visayas— Cuyo, Aguataya and Iloilo. Since 
much of my time was (k ( npipH ^vitli tear hing the then 
younfi;er ^^eneration the lanjina-.- and rnstoni^ fjf our own 
country, 1 have ne\ er ci^asinl t*^ iiv inti^restetl in the de- 
velojanent of ihose "Jewels of ibi* Pafifit ", thv IMiili [>])ine 
Islands, 

Happily, this interest Iras [hh^u far ilitalcd and main- 
tained by corresfJiHidencf with a raimbrr i^f rornrades arid 
friends who still livp in that pari of ihr world. Chief 
amon^ these are Joseph S. Johnston of Ji.hnstons- Ine., 
Zamhoanga; Jose Poni-r de Lecm, a retired Conslabuliiry 
ofliee of Cuyo, mii\ M, A. Maxi^v of Davacx 

However- since the information whir-h 1 rcreive from 
these comrades and friends is less t^eneral than per.sonab 
I will ajipreciate having yom- pnbl l( atiuti very 111 u eh in- 
deed. 1 gel The Manila BuUeiiu now ami then, and am a 
subseriher to The American Ohliimer. also of Manila, 
but 1 am sine that your magazine will ^rive me much 
additional information that I w ill be f^lad to obtain. 

Out of a membership (^f two luindred in our camp, more 
thaii two-thirds saw service in the "Islands/' The situa- 
tion being what it is in thai ]>art of the world at present, 
all of us are a bit anxious as to just what is going to 
happen to a land and people we tried in our small w-ay 
to make as free and hai>py as own. I am sure that 
)ou will understand that cuir interest and anxiety is for 
the best interests of that land and that people.
