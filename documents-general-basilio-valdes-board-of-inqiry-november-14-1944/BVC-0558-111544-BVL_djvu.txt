Provincial Jail 
Nov. 15 9 1944 


Dear Gen. Valdes: 

Please pardon this note, but you have taken so much interest 
in my case that I do not hesitate in appealing to you once more 
for a more speedy disposition of this sad affair. 

This is now my 24th day in jail without even knowing under 
what authority and under what charges I have been placed here. My 
knowledge of our constitutional rights under this government seems 
to rebel against what I consider a gross injustice committed against 
us, but we have been patient and have resigned ourselves to our sad 
condition, in the hope that soon we shall have justice. 

We have not yet lost hope no^ faith in our leaders of this newly 
established government of ours, and in conversations with our fellow 
inmates I seem to notice creeping into the minds day be day that feel- 
ing of exasperation, which may later turn into disappointment and 
lack of faith. 

This I would like to prevent for it may lead to disunion. 

The general feeling among us here inside is that whoever was res= 
possible for our detention or inprisonment has had enough time to 
file his charges. We only ask that we be heard soon. I am sure, 
General, you realise how it feels to be kept this way where you know 
you are totirely innoscent and more so especially, when you have been 
dealt with in the manner we have been dealt with. 

May I know when our hearings will start? 


Sincerely, 


(Sgnd) Bernado Torres
