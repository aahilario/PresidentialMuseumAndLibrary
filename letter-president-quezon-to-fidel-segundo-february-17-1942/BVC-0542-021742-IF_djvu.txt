My dear General Segundo: 

I have received your letter and without expressing 
any opinion on the merits and demerits of the order to 
which you refer - the matter being strictly an army 
affair - I donâ€™t think it is proper for me to continent 
one way or the other, but it is natural that I should 
feel, us I do feel, very sorry about the v/hole thing* 

I shall try to- find an opportune occasion to informally 
discuss this matter with your superiors. 

I want you to know ~ and I hope everybody in the 
field does know - that my heart and my prayers are with 
you all. I have been constantly sick since I came to 
this -fLece, end I think that the real reason for my 
illness are my worries and anxieties about my boys in 
the front. 

God bless you ell. Take for yourself and give to 
everybody my affectionate regards. 

Very sincerely yours, 

(SGD) MANUEL L, QUEZON
