Major General Basilio Valdez, * • 

Philippine Army, 

M anila, Philippines 

Dear General Valdez: 

For your information I am quoting below a 
portion of the letter received by this office from the Chief of 
the Bureau- of Insular Affairs relative to the awarding of a 
foreign decoration to you: 

"On June 14, 1957, this Bureau was informed by The 
Adjutant General that General Valdez, under the 
provisions of the Act of Congress approved April 24, 
1937 (Private No. 55, 75th Congress), had been 
authorized to accept the decoration; that inasmuch as 
the provision of Article 111, Section 1 (9), of the 
' T-PlfM-ippliJ^-Constitution seems clearly to require the 
consent of the Philippine National Assembly in addition 
to that of Congress of the United States before he 
could accept the decoration awarded him, the decoration 
in question would be retained in the office of The 
Adjutant General until the consent of the Philippine 
National Assembly had been granted. 

This information was communicated on June 17, 
1937, to the United States High Commissioner to the 
Philippine Islands with a request that this Bureau 
be advised when the Philippine KaVionair’a^Sbm.hly shall 
have consented to the acceptance of the decoration 
awarded to General Valdez." 


From the foregoing quotation it is evident 
that the consent of the Philippine National Assembly is required. 
You should, therefore, take the necessary steps there in order 
that we can facilitate the matter here. 


If I can be of further service to you 
please feel free to order. 


Yours Sincerely, 



QUINTIN PAREDES
