across the little clearing. My aides. Major Johnny Pugh and Cap-

served as my headquarters on Bataan.

MacArthur was not at the pier when 
we tied up, naturally. He was not at his 
office in Malinta Tunnel, either. But his 
chief of staff, Major General Sutherland,

New Premier Frees. 
Political Captives 

TOKYO, oct. 6. — up) — 

Aged Baron Kijyro Shidehara, 
long-time foe of Japan's machine- 
gun imperialism, became premier 
of a new government today and 
forthwith disbanded the dread 
secret police. 

Given a free hand by Em- 
peror Hirohito and the approval 
of General MacArthur’s head- 
quarters, the 73-year-old former 
ambassador to the United States 
dug into his desk with a vigor 
that belied his years. 

Domei agency said his first act 
was to reappoint as foreign min- 
ister Shigeru Yoshida, a like- 
minded man whose criticism of 
the war against the United States 
once landed him in jail. 

His second act, said the news- 
paper Asahi, was to appoint 
veteran Parliamentarian Yadanji 
Nakajima to the crucial post of 
home minister, under authority 
of which the “thought’* police 
ran their reign of terror. 

FREE PRISONERS 

It was the failure to obey 
promptly MacArthur’s order to 
dismiss Home Minister Iwao 
Yamazaki— who sought to save 
the secret police — that helped 
bring down Premier Higashi- 
Kuni’s post -surrender govern- 
ment yesterday. 

Domei announced that the 
home ministry, besides suspend- 
ing the secret police, freed 25 
political prisoners, including 16 
Communists. 

It likewise dissolved the spe- 
cial higher police censor depart- 
ment, which pried into the lives 
of dissenters, Domei news agency 
said.

Freak lightning and rain- 
storms swept over Southern 
California yesterday leaving 
in their wake one dead from 
lightning, one drowned and 
two others possibly drowned 
and considerable property 
damage. 

In the first storm of the sea- 
son, that broke the record hot 
spell and relieved the tinder- 
like condition of forest areas, 
communication was halted in 
some places, highways were 
washed out and tracks flooded, 
disrupting southbound train 
service. Los Angeles recorded a 
rainfall of .14 compared to .01 
last year. 

Killed instantly when struck 
oo the head by a bolt of light- 
ning was William F. Gilstrab, 45, 
of 7458 Kraft avenue, North 
Hollywood, who was shingling 
the roof of his newly-construct-

road, North Hollywood.

in the residence miraculously es-

More than 550,000 are idle 
across the country in labor 
disputes, but this figure is 
expected to drop to less than 
400,000 this week as indica- 
tions pointed to the return to 
work of more than 150,000. 
This is a summary of the labor 
picture:

He took me aside, and 
in a quiet voice lie let me have it quickly: 

“General MacArthur is going to leave 
here and go to Australia,” he said. “He’s 
up at the house now and wants to see you. 
But I’ll give you a fill-in first: 

“The President has been trying to get 
him to leave Corregidor for days, but 
until yesterday the General kept refusing. 
He plans to leave tomorrow evening 
around 6:30 by motor torpedo boat for 
Mindanao. A plane will pick him and his 
party up there and fly us the rest of the 
way. Tell no one — no one— of this until 
the morning after next, the morning of 
the 12th. 

“The General plans a number of 
changes. He’s going to divide his Philip- 
pine forces into four subcommands, 
himself retaining over-all command while 
in Australia. 

“You will be placed in command of 
all troops on Luzon. If it’s agreeable to 
you, General J ones will get another star 

I and take over your First Corps. Your 
new command will include Jones’ corps 
and General Parker's Second Corps, all 



LONDON, Oct. 6.— (INS) 
— Radio Moscow said today 
that the Russian military rep- 
resentative to General Doug- 
las MacArthur’s headquarters 
in Tokyo had arrived in Mos- 
cow after being summoned 
home by the Russian govern- 
ment. 

The representative is Lieu- 
tenant General Derevyanko. 

WASHINGTON, Oct. 6.— 
(/P) — Any move to supplant 
General Douglas MacArthur 
as supreme commander of oc- 
cupied Japan seemed certain 
today to arouse a storm of 
protest in Congress. 

Russia proposed at the London 
Big Five Conference the creation 
of a four-power commission to 
take over policy-making in Ja- 
pan. The Russians apparently 
want a setup somewhat similar 
to the Berlin commission. 

Legislators made it plain to- 
day, however, that if any move 
it made by the State Department 
and President Truman to accept 
such a proposal there will be an 
explosion among their ranks. 

Senator Lucas (Democrat), 
Illinois, told a reporter that while 
he recognizes the Russians 
should have some say about how 
Japan is run, he would never 
agree to taking away MacAr- 
thur’s powers as supreme com- 
mander.

Burbank studios at 5:30 a. m. 

A few hours later Union Attor-

temporary injunction, returnable

Judge John Beardsley, to prevent 
the studio from using tear gas

inning, winning, 4-1, at Chi-

be mound foes for the fifth game 
today, with the Tigers ruling a 
5-6 favorite.

others connected with the secret 
police plan of a Gestapo-like 



“thought control'* over Japan 



will be removed when the new 
cabinet is formed, this account 
added. 

Domei took advantage of Mac- 
Arthur's new freedom of speech 
decree to attack the secret po- 
lice, asserting its “bloody trail 
of ruthless activities’* kept the 
Japanese people in “utter dread 
of the name itself for many 
years." 



WAR DEBT PLAN- 



Shidehara’s emergence from 
the obscurity into which the mili- 
tarists thrust him coincided with 
a revolutionary proposal by the 
finance ministry to permit the 
Japanese people to buy into vast 
state holdings as a means of re- 
deeming the enormous war debts. 

The plan waa advanced by the 
ministry's policy-making com- 
mittee, Domei said. It did not 
specify the holdings to be sold, 
but the state owns 40 per cent of 
the forests and operates tele- 
phone and telegraph systems, 
most railroads and has large 
electric power holdings. 

Meanwhile, Lieutenant General 
Robert L. Eichelberger returned 
from northern Japan, where rice 
riots have been reported, and 
said that the Japanese people 
there, at first hostile, now wel- 
comed the American troops. 

The head of the U. S. Eighth 
Army of Occupation said the 
people were making plans for 
entertaining the troops in the 
hard winter ahead and that a 
nonfraternlzation order would 
be lifted in a day or two.

other riotous session which 
found jurors screaming “traitor’*

Judge Pierre Mongibeaux ban-

from the courtroom when Laval 
declared: 

“You’re trying to prepare a 
judicial crime.” I 

Later the judge wanted him fb 
return, but Laval refused, say

The emergence of Shidehara as 
premier came as a surprise, for 
up to the time of the announce- 
ment those close to the throne 
were saying the job would go to 
the baron's old friend. Yoshida. 

Yoshida had pressed Shidehara 
to accept, and while the old 
liberal tried to beg off, he finally 
agreed and his appointment was 
approved by Lieutenant General 
Richard K. Sutherland, Mac- 
Arthur’s chief of staff.

cided to proceed once more with- 
out Laval. 

Not only Laval “struck,” but 
also his attorneys and all defense 
witnesses. 

The astonishing day was 
rounded out by the judge calling 
for prosecution witnesses. For- 
mer President Lebrun was the 
first to testify. 

Lebrun declared that in his 
opinion “a gauleiter would have 
been better for France than the 
Vichy government.” 

Laval was suffering from a 
stomach ailment, but there was 
nothing wrong with his lungs. 

Red-faced and waving his arms 
after he was taken back to his 
cell, he protested against the 
“revolting partiality” of the court 
and said he would “await the 
verdict of history.”

FIREWORKS START— 

The fireworks began when the 
white-haired prosecutor, Andre 
Mornet, accused Laval of being 
evasive and trying to delay the 
trial. 

Then Judge Mongibeaux asked 
Laval where he obtained his 
power at Vichy, and before 
could answer the court declared: 
‘‘From the Germans." 

“You’re asking the questions 
and giving the answers,” yelled 
Laval. “It’s just as well I do 
not say anything further.” 

The jurors then leaped to their 
feet and shouted: 

“Justice win be done. You 
won’t escape your fate.” 

Mornet broke into this tumult 
with another shout. 

“If Laval had been tried a 



year ago he would have bee 
court-martialed and condemned 
to death,” he said. “It’s amph 
time that justice was don 

7 WON’T ANSWER 

“Lies,” Laval screamed again 
“I won’t answer any mor 
questions because I don’t wan 
to be a party to a crimina 
error.” 

“Guards, take him out,” th 
judge ordered. 

Just before the third day’s up- 
roar began Laval’s wife and 
daughter, Jose de Chambrun, vis- 
ited him in his cell. 

His wife, speaking gently to 
probably the most hated man in 
France, called him by a pet name, 
laying: # 

“Pierrot, finish gallantly.”

‘Here, it would continue to be a case of 
taking it on the chin, of fortunes worse than 
we even now had. Perhaps it was that 
thought that kept both of us from speculat-

It was time to go back to Bataan. While 
we talked I could hear its distant thunder 
across the water. MacArthur walked down 
the porch steps with me and gave me a box 
of his cigars and two big jars of shaving 
cream, which were to come in so liandv dur- 
ing my captivity. 

“Good-by, Jonathan,” he said, shak-

still on Bataan, I’ll make you a lieutenant 
general.” 

"I'll be on Bataan if I'm alive," 

I swore. 

I turned around and walked slowly

Zamperini, Survivor of Life Raff 
and Jap Prison Camps, Home Safe 



“Cara mama mla — ” 

These softly spoken words — 
Italian for “Dear Mother Mine" 
and then — 

In the gray light of morning, 

in slanting rain on the landing 
strip of a Long Beach airfield 
yesterday a small, gray -haired 
woman was swept into the arms 
of a soldier -hero. 

He was Captain Louis Zam- 
perini — back from the “dead” and 
the hell of Jap prison camps. 

Sharing the reunion in the rain 
were others of the 28 -year -old 
hero's family — his father, brother 
and tw’o sisters, all of them had 
refused to believe an official 
Army report of his death 

Father Anthony Zamperini 
watched the fiercely tender em- 
brace of the mother and the Air 
Forces bombardier and former 
University of Southern Califor- 
nia running champion, whose B 
24 crashed into the Pacific in 
May of 1943. 

He too embraced theV flyer ar- 
dently 

Sisters Virginia and Mrs. Sylvia 
Flammer were next to greet

Louis, then a brother, Pete, a 
Navy chief specialist stationed 
in San Diego. 

The rain stopped as suddenly 
as it had begun seconds before 
Captain Zamperini had stepped 
from the B-25 which brought him 
from San Francisco — three days 
after his arrival from Japan. 

Then Zamperini was greeted 
by a grateful Army. 

An Army grateful to a Purple 
Heart winner — and the holder of 
trie Silver Star, three Oak Leaf 
Clusters and four battle stars. 

It was an Army not unmindful 
of the ordeal Zamperini went 
through in 47 days on a lifeboat 
without food and only occasional 
raimvater or the fluid from fish 
he could catch, for drink. 

Nor did the Army lose sight 
of the two years and seven 
months of Jap indignities in 
prison camps at Truk, in the 
Marshalls and on the Jap main- 
land following his capture' on the 
raft. 

For Hero Zamperini and his 
family, the Army had arranged 
for cars to drive the happy group 



to its home at 2028 Gramercy 
place, Torrance. 

There, Zamperini told friends 
and newsmen: 

“This," he said, “this little 
home, was worth all of it. 

“No, I haven’t a darned thln£ 
else to say. No girl, no plans, 
Just this little home — my mom 
and my dad and the family.” 
The flyer said he had been 
granted 10 days at home, after 
which he would report to Birm- 
ingham Hospital in Van Nuys for 
a physical checkup. 

“After that/’ he said, "I get a 
90-day leave. From there on, I 
don’t know. My Army papers 
read that way and I’m just going 
to let the Army work it out. Now 
fellows, if you don’t mind—.’’ 

No one minded.

DENTAL PLATES ON 



BUDGET PAYMENTS 



TO SUIT YOU 



Arrange with Accepted Credit and pay for 
plates as you wear them w ith w eekly or 
monthly installments. 



DR. PAINLESS 
PARKER 



Says 



You make your own 
terms* within reason, 
when you use Accepted 
Credit for dental plates. 
Pay as you are paid bv 
week or month to suit 
your convenience. 




Plates have tested 
balance and 
enduring strength 
and will not warp 



Advantages of the im- 
proved material recom- 
mended by dentists for 
dental plates are found in 
the adaptability and resili- 
ence of transparent den- 
tures. They have unfad- 
ing color and permanent 
natural form. Plates arc 
more graceful in design, 
have more wearing effic- 
iency. Although lighter in 
weight, they have balance 
and durability. And they 
are hard to detect. 



Translucent teeth 
impart live, vital 
appearance to plates 



Science, responding to a 
long-felt desire, has per- 
fected translucent teeth 
for dental restorations. 
These refined artificial 
teeth absorb and reflect 
light as do fine, natural 
teeth. The diffused hues 
of these teeth and their 
shape make them a 
natural choice when you 
are getting new dental 
plates.

Visit a dentist at frequent 
intervals, have teeth ex-

sult. This can be avoided 
when you avail yourself 
of Accepted Credit for

'Philosophy' 
Ends in Sleep 



Red-haired Elaine Morey, 24- 
year-old motion picture actress, 
was in the General Hospital yes- 
terday after “too much philoso- 
phy” in a swank Rossmore dis- 
trict apartment. 

Miss Morey and several friends 
were visiting Barton Yarborough, 
radio actor, at 570 North Ross- 
more avenue, where the group, 
according to police, was “discuss- 
ing philosophical subjects.” 
Perhaps Miss Morey was bored. 
At any rate, Yarborough discov- 
ered her later in the evening un- 
conscious. Nearby was an emptied 
vial that had contained sleeping 
tablets. He immediately tele- 
phoned Hollywood Receiving Hos- 
pital. 

Miss Morey of 23014 North New 
Hampshire avenue, is the former 
wife of Robert W. Major, dra-

DENTAL SERVICE 
A NATIONAL NEED 



Estimates based on’ surveys in- 
dicate there will be an accumu- 
lated need for 130,000,000 

dental chair hours of work in 
the post-war years. Today 90 
per cent of the people are in 
need of dental work of some 
kind, whereas only about 25 
per cent are getting it. 



Wartime and 
production goals 
put heavy demands 
upon workers 



To meet the stepped-up pro 
gram of industry in the 
United States, the men and 
women in plants and factories 
have to protect health against 
the perils of infection and dis- 
ease. Energy is impaired when 
ailing teeth do not get prompt 
treatment.

“Police problems are one thing. 
Politics is another. To yoke the 
two together is an invitation to 
crime.” 

So said Councilman Lloyd G. 
Davies, chairman of the police 
and fire committee, yesterday, in 
announcing he would oppose any 
attempt to “pair” the ordinance 
increasing the police force with 
pet revenue measures favored by 
anyone else. 

“The hiring of more police has 
already had tough enough sled- 
ding," Davies said, recalling that 
a half-dozen official actions have 
been taken since the Examiner 
first voiced the demand for more 
police. 

Several members of the Coun- 
cil have already expressed their 
willingness to vote for more of- 
ficers, but “not until a revenue 
bill is passed.” 

$363,000 NEEDED— 

The total revenue needs of the 
city are between $8,000,000 and 
$10,000,000, according to Mayor 
Fletcher Bowron; while the 
Council will have to put up only 
$363,000 to carry the increased 
police force until January 1, 
when the new revenue measures 
are expected to become effective. 

Davies, who wrote the resolu- 
tion which first brought the 
crime situation before the Coun- 
cil, was joined by several other 
Councilmen in his stand. 

At the week-end meeting of the 
police and fire committee with 
the personnel committee, Coun- 
cilmen George P. Cronk, Harold 
Harby and G. Vernon Bennett 
also stated they would fight to 
enact the increase without regard 
to any other measure before the 
Council. .

Part of Oil Strikers Return 



By Felix Cotten 

Hr" CtrTMf'ftdtnt IMw«»tl*n«l Niwi Sar»lc* 

WASHINGTON, Oct. 6.-Chair- 
man George (Democrat), Georgia, 
of the Senate finance committee, 
declared today that individual in- 
come taxes would have to be cut 
60 per cent in the next three years 
if the nation is to have a healthy 
economic life. 

In commenting on the tax re- 
ductions voted by the House ways 
and means committee, George 
•aid the committee’s individual 
income tax cut was “substantially 
all right at this time, but only 
about one-third of the reduction 
that must be made in Individual 
taxes.” 

The House legislative drafting 
service was busy today writing 
a bill containing the committee 
tax reductions, which would carve 
an estimated five billion, 319 
million dollars from Government 
revenues in 1946. 

Leaders intend to call the bill 
up In the House next Thursday 
for passage under a rule that 
would bar amendments from the 
House floor. 

George indicated that he would 
try to make certain changes in 
the bill in the finance committee, 
if the House, as is expected, 
passes the measure in the form 
approved by the ways and means 
committee. 

The finance committee prob- 
ably will start work on the bill 
October 15. he said.

Duke of Windsor, who stepped 
down from the throne of Eng- 
land a decade ago, conferred 
with King George VI — his brother 
and successor — for an hour to- 
night at Buckingham Palace. 

Court circles earlier had said 
that the Duke emphasized his 
wish to serve Britain in what- 
ever position the King felt most 
appropriate. This wish was ex- 
pressed during an affectionate 
reunion . last night with the 
royal family.

President O. A. Knight of the 
International Oil Workers’ Union 
predicted most of the 51 seized 
refineries would be delivering 
gasoline and oil this week, but 
many oil locals declined to say 
what action they would take 
pending membership meetings 
scheduled over the week end. 

In Texas 15 refineries and pipe- 
line systems resumed operations 
under Navy direction at Houston, 
Fort Worth, Texas City and Cor- 
pus Christi. 

In Washington, it was learned 
the Navy has agreed to join with 
the C. I. O.-Oil Workers in ask- 
ing War Labor Board approval 
of a 15 per cent wage increase 
which some refinery companies 
agreed to put into effect when 
a 40-hour week is restored in the 
industry. 

In Detroit, the Ford Motor 
Company recalled some 60,000 



laid off workers on the basis of 
a C. L O. announcement that the 
strike at the Kelsey-Hayes Wheel 
Company, which supplies parts to 
the Ford Company, had been ter- 
minated. Ford spokesmen said 
production would be resumed 
this week. 

More labor troubles confronted 
the Ford Company as the U. A. 
W. announced a notice of intent 
to call a strike of 145,000 Ford 
workers would be filed Monday 
with the National Labor Rela- 
tions Board to enforce demands 
for a 30 per cent wage increase. 

In the wake of Friday’s four- 
hour work stoppage by telephone 
employees in a demonstration of 
union strength, the Federation of 
Long Line Telephone Workers an- 
nounced that notice of a strike 
vote among hundreds of thou- 
sands of telephone workers 
throughout the nation would be 
filed with the National Labor Re- 
lations Board within 15 days. 
Henry Mayer, counsel for the 



Federation, said the workers 
probably would demand an av- 
erage wage boost of 30 per cent

General Wainwright Tells of Last 
Dramatic Pledge to MacArthur 



Noted Soldiers 
in Final Pact

service troops on Bataan, and the men 
up in the Cagayan Valley and in the 
Mountain province. 

“General Moore will remain in 
command of the harbor defenses and the 
fortified islands in the bay, and General 
Chenoweth will command the troops 
in the Visayan Islands, and General 
Sharp will have charge of Mindanao. 

“He’s going to leave Colonel Beebe 
here, give him a star, and make him his 
Deputy Chief of Staff, to carry out his 
commands from Australia ...” General 
Sutherland, then as now MacArthur’s 
Chief of Staff, paused and looked at me. 

“You look hungry, Skinny,” he said. 

I shrugged, but I was. 

“Come on,” he invited, “have some 
lunch and then we’ll go up to the house.” 

I shook my head. “Nope, I think not,” 

I said, not wanting to pick up any habits 
I could not keep on Bataan. “We eat only 
twice a day over there.” 

Two Soldiers Meet 

So Sutherland took me out the east end 
of the tunnel to the little slate-gray house a 
quarter of a mile away. The island had 
taken two sharp air raids at the start of 
things, three torturous months before, but 
MacArthur’s house and the two other small 
ones near it were not touched. Those raids 
continued sporadically. But now it seemed 
quiet and peaceful there as we walked up to 
the porch. 

MacArthur came out on the porch, after 
saying something to Mrs. MacArthur and 
the boy inside. HE WAS TIRED, BUT HE 
GRINNED AND SHOOK HANDS WITH 
ME. He calls me Jonathan. The only per- 
son in the world who does. 

"Jonathan," he said, as we 

sat down, "I want you to under- 
stand my position very plainly. I'm 
leaving tor Australia pursuant to 
repeated orders of the President. 
Things have gotten to such a point 
that I must comply with these 
orders or get out of the Army. 

"I want you to make it 
known throughout all elements of 
your command that I'm leaving 
overmy repeated protests.' 

“Of course I will, Douglas,” I told 
him warmly. 

Then he repeated substantially what 
Sutherland had told me about the altered 
command, and turned to the tactical situa- 
tion on Bataan— by that time simply 
desperate. 

“We’re alone, Jonathan, you know 
that as well as I,” he said. “If I get 
through to Australia, you know I’ll come 
back as soon as I can with as much as I 
can. In the meantime, you’ve got to 
hold.” He gave me a cigar. 

One Aim in Life 

I told him that holding Bataan was our 

aim in life. 

“Yes, yes, I know,” he went on, ey- 
ing me. “But I want to be sure that 
you’re defending in as great depth as you 
can. You’re an old cavalry man, Jona- 
than, and your training has been along 
thin, light, quick-hitting lines. The de- 
fense of Bataan must be deep. For any 
prolonged defense you must have depth.” 

“I know th at,” I sai d. “I’m deploy-

‘This Is My Story’ 

By Gen. Jonathan M. Wainwright 

(Copyright, 1945, King Features Syndicate, Inc. Repro- 
duction in whole or in part strictly prohibited.) 

So I was on my own. And sitting there 
in the little boat that carried me back to 
Bataan on March 10, a month before the 
^ peninsuia fell, it would have been easy to 
yield to the vaguely sickening loneliness of 
the doomed. 

But I put that sensation out of my 
mind and made myself think of the tasks 
that lay ah$ad as the commander of all of 
Bataan’s forces. One of the sternest of these 
would be telling my men that their top com- 
mander had left. I found myself wondering 
how they would take it, and I resolved to 
see to it that they understood as I under- 
stood.

Manila-- a Soldier's Goal 

I thought, too, as we neared Bataan 
again, of the steady deterioration of our 
country’s position in the Philippines from 
the date of mv arrival in November, 1940, 
up to today’s discouraging low. I could 
trace that decline now in mj r mind as 
clearly as I could trace the outline of Mari- 
velcs, and even the spoken words of those 
15 previous months took substance again. 

To me, a soldier, the assignment to the 
Philippines at the end of 1940 was the real- 
ization of a considerable goal. I had had 
commands before in my life, but never one 
as important as this to which the War De- 
partment assigned me in 1940: commander 
of the Philippine Division. They put an- 

other star on my shoulders making me a Huffman Named 
temporary major general. Such things are 
deeply moving in the life of a regular Army 
man. Promotions are an Army man’s life 
and sustenance; promotions and opportuni-

TIIEY WERE ON THE JOB— In the day, 

before the outbreak of war Generals Douglas Mac- 
Arthur and Jonathan Wainwright were working 
closely together. They were making the best of what 
they had, building the best possible army from avail- 



able manpower. The two generals are shown here as 
they reviewed some of the forces in the Philippines 
which were soon to enter one of the bloodiest conflicts 
of the Pacific War. General Wainwright tells of Mac- 
Arthur’s many handicaps.

After a conference of C. I. O. 
officials in Long Beach late yes- 
terday, C. E. Frederick, secre- 
tary of Local 128, said: 

“The Navy has not yet asked 
us to go back to work. We 
have instructions from inter- 
national headquarters In Fort 
Worth, Tex., to contact the 
Navy representative immedi- 
ately upon his arrival. 

“We have also been asked 
to determine the scheduling of 
men back to work and the 
date he desires us to start 
operations. 

“We are prepared to pledge 
our full support to the Navy 
when It takes over. We would 
meet the naval representative 
today if we knew where to see 
him.

Wife Who Shot Her 
Collapses in Jail 

(Special I# lh» L»* Annie* E**n.!nM) 

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 7. 
— On a lonely road atop a 
Pedro Point cliff in San Mateo 
County, overlooking the 
ocean, the search for missing 
Dr. John H. Mansfeldt ended 
abruptly and tragically today. 

Confirmed were the fears of 
his wife, repeated incessantly 
following her imprisonment for 
the “jealousy” slaying of Nurse 
Vada Martin, that he was “dead 
. . . dead. . . . I’m sure he's done 
away with himself.” 

Suspicions of an apparently 
deserted green sedan parked on 
the cliff since Thursday, the day 
of the nurse's murder, a near-by 
resort owner went to the car 
today. He found Dr. Mansfeldt 
dead, a suicide — from a powerful 
Injection of a “pain-killing’' 
drug, which he administered via 
a hypodermic needle, authorities 
theorized. 

NEEDLE FOUND 

Apparently dead since Thurs- 
day, he lay slumped on the front 
seat, his physician’s stethoscope 
protruding from his hip pocket. 

In the car’s glove compart- 
ment, which contained the usual 
medical paraphernalia a doctor 
carries on his house calls, San 
Mateo County Deputy Sheriffs 
John O’Brien and Milton Mine- 
han found two drained vials of 
liquid narcotic, used to ease pain 
and shock. 

And wedged carefully in the 
same compartment was a glass- 
barreled hypodermic needle 
which bore what appeared to be 
traces of the drug. 

Following an autopsy late 
today. Coroner’s officials said 
that blood tests would have to 
be taken and the stomach con- 
tents analyzed before the spe- 
cific cause of death could be 
determined. Because of the de- 
composed condition of the body 
they were unable to find any 
break in the skin such as would 
have been made by a hypoder- 
mic needle. 

NOTES ABSENT 

There were no notes, no mes- 
sages as to why Dr, Mansfeldt 
had taken his owm life. 

But authorities, piecing to- 
gether information obtained 
from Mrs. Mansfeldt’s attorney, 
James Maclnnis, and the man 
who found the body, George J. 
Lewis, theorized the following 
had occurred: 

Word of the slaying by his 
wife reached him Thursday 
morning, while he was at his 
office. Authorities had tele- 
phoned him immediately after 
Mrs. Mansfeldt drove up to Cen- 
tral Emergency Hospital with 
her victim, announcing: 

“There’s a dying woman in 
my car outside,” and shortly 
after, “I killed her.” 

Dr. Mansfeldt hurried to the 
hospital. He identified his wife,

Yesterday T.ewis became curi- 
ous. He hiked up to the car, and 
made his discovery. The state- 
wide search for Dr. Mansfeldt 
had ended. 

To Attorney Maclnnis went the 
task of breaking the news to 
Mrs. Mansfeldt — and so hysteri- 
cal did she become that she was 
ordered to the psychopathic ward 
at San Francisco Hospital for 
observation and treatment. 

Refreshed by a night’s sleep, 
itftd calm, Mrs. Maijsfeldt lay 
aside a magazine she was read- 
ing, when called by the matron, 
left her cell, and gave Maclnnis 
a pleasant greeting. The attorney 



Her piercing screams shattered 
the Sunday morning prison calm. 
Moaning, sobbing, she cried in- 
coherently: 

“I killed him! ... I killed my 
husband! . . . My babies (her 
three 'teen-age children). . , . 
My life! . . . 

"AVlth the woman (she was 
apparently referring to the 
nurse, prison attaches believed) 

I couldn't feel anything. . . . 
There was no sense of reality 
(apparently after she fatally 
shot her, it was believed). . , . 
But I killed my husband! 

“I nearly died last year. , . . 

I fought against it all year. 

“She was a part of it. . . . She 
taught him to do It. . . .” 



“As a first essential, our ner Welles, former Undersecre- 
nation should have a respect- .ary of State, who said: 



able position In the matter of 
military readiness so that it 
may he free of the fear of 
forceful domination imposed 
by sudden and unscrupulous 
attack." 

Bernard M. Baruch, head of 
the war industries board in 
World War I and an active con- 
sultant in World War II, said: 

“We dare not disarm yet. 
There Is no peace, hut when it 
comes. It must be peace by co- 
operation and not by appease- 0 
ment.” 






“If the occupation of Ger- 
many is to succeed in eliminat- 
ing the German menace it must 
represent a policy which Is laid 
down and supported equally by 
the United States, the Soviet 
Union, Great Britain, France 
and other nations called upon 
to share in that tremendous 
obligation to future genera- 
tions."

airy, ■which eventually was to fight as few 
cavalry units ever fought — and whose gal- 
lant horses’ flesh was eventually to sustain 
life in those of us who survived. 

There was another force in the Philip- 
pines at the end of 1940. This was the Phil- 
ippine army, then being trained under the 
direction of MacArthur. He had retired 
from the United States Army after his long 
tour of duty as chief of staff under Presi- 
dents Hoover and Roosevelt and had ac- 
cepted the post of commander in chief of 

the Philippine army. 

’ MacArthur’s rank then was field mar- 
shal of the Philippine army. With the aid 
of the Philippine government’s Conscrip- 
tion Act he was slowly putting together the 
army that was to take over the defense of 
the islands after the American forces with- 
drew in 1946 under the terms of the Philip- 
• pine Independence Act. 

MacArthur's Handicaps 




It was slow and tedious work for Mac- 
Arthur, handicapped by lack of funds and 
equipment. MacArthur was training two 
installments of Filipinos each year, devot- 
ing five and a half months to each group. 
Their training was largely individual. 
There was not much field training for these 
men, nor any great deal of training in the 
use of weapons. 

IN FACT, IT WAS NOT UNTIL 
THE SUMMER OF 1941 THAT ANY 
UNIT TRAINING WAS ATTEMPTED, 
AND THAT WAS ONLY FOR A 
PERIOD OF ABOUT TWO WEEKS 
AND WAS ONLY IN THE SMALLER 
UNITS. THE MASS OF THEM — SO 
SOON TO FIGHT — HAD NONE OF 
THE COOPERATIVE TRAINING SO 
NECESSARY IN THE BUILDING OF 
THE INFANTRY ARTILLERY TEAM. 

Mv chief association with MacArthur 
during this early period was social, plus the 
fact that I furnished his Philippine trainees

MITTAL FOII HEST— This motorcycle dis- 
patch rider on Bataan went through a strange, but 
often repeated, ritual before he laid down for 20 min- 



utes “out.” His trigger finger rests on his best defensive 
weapon, his sidearms are within easy reach, he can 
“throw his pillow” at enemy if necessary. Look closely 



— the “pillow” is ammunition. Many of these riders 
worked day after day on the little sleep they could get 

by the roadside and always in extreme danger.

with drill grounds and rifle ranges at Fort 
McKinley, the post I commanded. 

In my talks with MacArthur that 
winter of 1940-41 the question of war with 
Japan rarely arose. He had no information 
at that time to indicate the approach of 
Japan’s attack, and I certainly had none. 

It was not until the spring of 1941 that I 
got the feeling in my bones that war was 
inevitable. 

Of course both of us had been schooled 
for years before that in the theoretical 

i' • 

problem of fighting Japan, just as all grad- 
uates of the War College and the Command 
and General Staff Schools are instructed. 

We were thoroughly familiar with 
WAR PLAN ORANGE, No. 3 (or WPO-3, 
as it was condensed). 

WPO-3, A VARIATION OF A PLAN 
ABOUT 20 YEARS OLD, WAS THIS: IN 
THE EVENT OE A SUCCESSFUL JAP- 
ANESE LANDING ON THE MAIN 
ISLAND OF .LUZON THE PHI LI PPINE 
DIVISION AND THE PHILIPPINE 
ARMY. IF UNABLE TO BEAT OFF THE 
LANDINGS AND SUBSEQUENT AD- 
VANCES OF THE THEORETICAL 
ENEMY, WERE TO FIGHT DELAYING 
ACTIONS AND WITHDRAW INTO BA- 
TAAN PENINSULA. THE PLAN EN- 
VISIONED A SIX-MONTH STAND ON 
BATAAN. BY WHICH TIME AID FROM 
THE UNITED STATES AYOULD AR- 
RIVE. 



This Was Defeatist Plan 



MacArthur and I agreed that it was a 
defeatist plan, but our feeling in the matter 

did not change it. - 

The sparkle went out of Manila in the

in this photograph. In the foreground death has taken 
one of the heroic defenders. A sheet has been pulled

"epairs, my old model is right in style with no bumpers, no 
running board, no headlights, and no door handles. The way 
it sheds accessories whenever I hit a bump In the road, it 
looks like a mechanical version of Gypsy Rose Lee. 

But the new automobile designs are going to be revolu- 
tionary. Some of them will only have three wheels. . . . But, of 
course, that Isn’t anything new. The Hollywood High School 
crowd has been using that type for years. 

But there Is one old-fashioned feature the designers 
haven’t been able to do anything about. No matter how much 
they eliminate, they still haven’t figured out a way to keep

Warns U. S. Must Stay First 
in Development of Weapons 

''America must keep ahead 
of all other nations in the de- 
velopment of offensive and de- 
fensive weapons. That’s the 
best way to keep out of war— 
nobody goes around poking 
Joe Louis in the nose.” 
Lieutenant General James H. 
Doolittle, “Los Angeles’ own” 
general, yesterday voiced that 
terse warning in an interview at 
the Beverly Hills Hotel. 

“We - don’t

He is Jay Ward Hill, now at 
the home of his uncle, Robert

where his fathe 
practiced law. He said: 

“I saw my father suffering 
from Jap beatings, my mother, 
brothers and sister grow thin 
from malnutrition and I saw 
my best friend shot by a Jap 
guard.” 

"I have an appeal pending in 
Washington. Unless it goes 
through, I guess the war isn’t 
yet over for Jay Ward Hill.” 



want war — we 
want peace, and we must im- 
pose our will for peace on the 
other nations of the world.” 

The high-ranking Army Air 
Forces officer, leader of the first 
bombing raid on Tokyo, was in 
Loo Angeles as part of a nation- 
wide series of public appearances 
to acquaint the American peo- 
ple with the wartime and post- 
war problems of our military 
forces. 

TEAMWORK WON 

“The war was won by team- 
work,” Doolittle declare d. 
“Teamwork between the Al- 
lies, and teamwork between 
the services. 

“The atomic bomb by itself 
could not have won the war. 
First you have to get the 
bomb over your target — and 
we had to defeat the Jap air 
force before we could do that.” 
Foreseeing a future of pilot- 
less, radio-controlled, television- 
equipped air projectiles for mili- 
tary purposes, and civilian 
planes capable of speeds faster 
than sound, the general stated: 

“We must not allow our- 
selves to relax our efforts in 
scientific research and develop- 
ment, both military and civil- 
ian. Our big fault after the 
last war was to slip back into

“Besides,” he said, “by cus- 
tom, air fields and military 
bases are named only* after 
soldiers who have died — and,” 
he added smilingly, “I don’t 
feel quite ready yet to make 
that sacrifice.” 

General Doolittle was guest of 



honor last' night a Hollywood 
Victory Committee meeting in 



aviation. 

“I have 203 discharge 
points,” he disclosed, “and I’m 
ready to become a civilian 
again as soon as the Army 
says it no longer needs me.” 
Speaking of General Douglas 
MacArthur, Doolittle declared: 
"General MacArthur is one 
of the great men of his day. 
He has enemies. Just as any 
great and firm man has, but 
he has done a magnificent job 
and Is still doing It. His mili- 
tary record speaks for him, 
and no one can belittle it.” 

DECLINES HONOR— 

Doolittle, one-time student at 
Manual Arts High School here, 
said he had requested Mayor 
Bowron to abandon the plan to 
name the new Los Angeles air- 



the Beverly Wilshlre Hotel, the 
opening gun of a “Stars Over 
America” bond-selling tour in 
which a cavalcade of 30 film stars 
will open the Victbry Loan Drive 
on October 29. 

LAUDS MOVIES 

Addressing the meeting at 
which Producer Louis B. Mayer 
was chairman, Doolittle voiced 
high praise for Hollywood’s con- 
tribution to the war effort as a 
center of production and man- 
power and as a builder of morale 
for America’s fighting men. 

Doolittle and his party were 
schedueld to take off from San 
Bernardino this morning for

(Continued from page 6.) 

spring of 1941. War was coining and we all 
mew it. Major General George Grunert, 
hen commander of the Philippine Depart- 
flent, began making determined efforts to 
)ry more supplies out of Washington and 
o bring my complement? of Philippine 
Scouts up to the full statutory strength of 
. 2 , 000 . • 

Another sign of uneasiness came late 
n the winter when the War Department 
lirected that the dependents of all military 
)ersonnel in the Philippines be evacuated. 
This followed on the heels of a similar or- 
ler bv the Navy. 

S' V 

Like most of the other wives, Mrs. 
.Yainwright did not want to go. Like most 
>f the other husbands, I guess, I lied to her 
md told her it would be just a short separa- 
ion; that the trouble would blow over soon 
tnd we would go on living again as people 
ihould live. 

he Last Ship Sails 

She did not believe me any more than 
he other wives believed what their men 
vere telling them. Nor did her mother, 
drs. D. E. Holley, who was going home 
vith her. But we all made a pretense at 
reating the matter as lightly as other dis- 
omforts of Army life are treated. There 
cere farewell parties — despedidas we 
ailed them in our uncertain Spanish — with 
nuch false enthusiasm. I remember espe- 
•iallv one big one for the ladies at the Army- 
Savy Club. 

But when the last ship, the Washing- 
on, pulled out from Manila on May 14, 
£941, there were .sudden tears along the 
"ails of the ship and all of us on the dock, 
vaving with frozen smiles, felt mighty bad. 

I WENT TO WORK THEN IN 




PRIMITIVE — In the shallow waters of a Philip- 
pine stream Army nurses, taking a fejv minutes off 



from improvised wards filled with dying men, bathe ft were shortlived. These were among the women wtio 
and wash their clothing. Respites from their duties V became the heroines of Bataan and Corregidor.

Around the end of July, 1941, General

the following Sunday morning at his head- 
quarters in Manila. 1 drove down from 
near-by Fort McKinley that morning and 
found Ills headquarters filled with a lot of 
restless old friends; Generals King, Moore, 
Holderness and others. 

General Grunert stood up after a bit, 
cleared his throat and read from the paper 
in his hand. 1 still remember the approxi- 
mate words: 

“Major General Douglas MacAr- 
thur, retired, is placed upon active duty 
in the grade of lieutenant general and is 
assigned command of all United States

defenders fought. He also tells of earlier pleas to 
Washington for men and equipment.

GOLDEN RULE 



Calls on All ‘to Get in Push’ 
Behind Reconversion Tasks 



By Robert G. Nixon 

SUM C«r«w>nd»nt iMrenxtlonxl Nnrs Sauls* 

CARUTHERSV1LLE, Mo., Oct. 
7. — President Truman said today 
the United States is destined to 
lead the world to lasting peace 
on the basis of the "Golden 
Rule.” 

Despite "difficulties.” t h e 
President said, “we are not 
stalled on the road ... to lib- 
erty and peace.” 

Mr. Truman spoke to a Pemi- 
scot County Fair crowd of some 
50,000. He warned that the an- 
cient Biblical maxim for good 
neighborliness must be practiced 
by Americans at home and by 
America’s allies abroad. 



CALLS ON ALL 

In this country, he called upon 
management, labor, the farmer 
and the storekeeper “to get in 
the push” to make the reconver- 
sion program work with the same 
efficiency devoted to the nation’s 
industrial war machine. 

“We have th^ greatest pro-

duction machine the world has 
ever seen," the President said. 

“We conclusively proved that 
free government Is the most 
efficient government In every 
emergency. 

“In order to prove to the 
world tlmt our Yeconversion 
program can be handled just as 
efficiently, and that our tre- 
mendous production machine 
can be operated for peace as 
well as war — we must all get 
in and push. 

“It needs nothing more than 
the cooperation of management 
and labor, the farmer and the 
storekeeper, and everyone else 
who Is Interested In the United 
States.” 

The President issued his call 
to the nation for cooperation in 
the hard task of returning to 
peace in an extemporaneous 
speech late this afternoon after 
he had attended the closing day 
of a typical county fair with his 
southeast Missouri friends.

Von Wiegaml Says : 

Renunciation of A-bomb 
Use Futile Gesture 

By Karl H. von Wiegand 

Dean of American Foreign Correspondents 

Written Expressly for the Hearst Newspapers 

MAORI IK Oct. 7.— President Truman has recog- 
nized the probability that the period of sole exclusive posses- 
sion of the secret cosmic force for destruction in the hands 
of America, Britain and Canada may be short. 

In wanting to ask universal renunciation of the use of 
the atomic bomb as a weapon in war, he realizes the vast 
menace to peace, to mankind and to civilization. 

The renunciation of the use of* ” ~~ “ ~ 

. . . - „ . first flash and thunder of 

the atomic bomb as a weapon in 

war by all governments of today, 
would be as futile and as great 
an illusion as was the renuncia- 
tion of war itself as an instru- 
ment of national policy solemnly 
undertaken by all the nations of 
the world in the Kellogg- Briand 
pact signed in Paris August 2T, 

1918. 

I was present. I called it a 
“document of elusion.”

The President touched not only 
on the domestic problems facing 
the nation in the wake of war 
but spoke about foreign policy, 
and Issued a stern warning that 
another global war “would de- 
stroy civilization as we know it.” 
“We can’t stand another 
global war,” he declared. “We 
can’t even have another war 
unless It Is a total war and that 
would mean the end of our 
civilization as we know It.” 

The President spoke of the 
atomic bomb as “too terrible to 
envision,” but he said that atomic 
energy, properly harnessed and 
properly used, can be the great- 
est boon to mankind that it has 
ever known. 

MEETS LEGION 

Tonight, the President attended 
an American Legion smoker. 

Early tomorrow he and his 
party will leave for Reelfoot 
Lake, famous West Tennessee

, before flying to Gilbertsville, Ky., 
(Wednesday morning to dedicate 
I the new Kentucky Dam. He will

Truman Asks 
UNRRA Fund 

WASHINGTON, Oct. 7.— UP)— 
President Truman has asked 
Congress to appropriate $550,- 
000,000 immediately for the 
United Nations Relief and Re- 
habilitation Administration. 

UNRRA requires the funds, 
the President said, to meet 
"acute need and privation” dur- 
ing the coming winter in Europe 

Additionally, Mr. Truman said 
he soon will ask for more money 
for the agency so it may "meet 
its new responsibilities and com 
plete its programs.” 

His recommendations we r e 
contained in a letter to House 
Speaker Rayburn (Democrat), 
Texas. 

$40,000 Church Fire 

JONESBORO, Ark., Oct. 7.— 
(INS)— Fire of an undetermined 
origin destroyed the $40,000 Wal- 
nut Street Baptist Church in 
Jonesboro today. 



HEItLIN. oct. 7. — up ) — 

The Allied War Crimes Tribunal 
has completed its indictment 
against the 24 Nazi war criminals 
to be tried at Nuernberg, and 
copies of the 20,000-word docu- 
ment will be handed to them in 
their cells on Tuesday, it was 
announced today. 

Sir Hartley Shawcross, chief 
prosecutor for the British, told 
a new's conference that a mes- 
senger will file with the clerk of 
the Allied War Crimes Tribunal 
in Berlin on Tuesday copies of 
the bulky 43-page indictment. 

At the same time, he added, 
copies will be served on each of 
the 23 top ranking Nazis in 
Nuernberg — two days before the 
text will be released to the world 
at large. 

By agreement of the four- 
power tribunal, the text of the 
i indictment will be released for 
publication on Thursday in 
Washington, Moscow, London 
and Paris. The hour was set 
tentatively at 8 p. m., Greenwich 
mean time (12 noon Pacific 
Standard Time). 

Shawcross said the Allied 
war crimes court had decided 
against holding any formal ses- 
sion in Berlin, as previously 
announced. Instead the indict- 
ment will be sent by messenger 
to the. court’s office here in the 
Allied Council Building, and filed 
with the clerk. 



With a $500 reward check In 
his pocket, discharged Navy 
AMMl/c Rudolph C. Garza was 
on his way home to San Antonio, 
Tex., last night, saying: 

“It’s all like a fairy story 
where everybody lives happily 
ever after.’” 

He was talking about the kid- 
naping of 5-year-old Florence 
Genevieve Garcia. Garza discov- 
ered the child in San Diego, 
recognizing her from a picture 
published in the Examiner. 

The little girl was returned 
to her mother, Mrs. Lita Garcia, 
of 848 Wall street, and Garza 
received the $500 reward which 
he plans to bank for the educa- 
tion of his own 7-year-old son, so 
in this story, everybody does "live 
happily ever after” — everybody, 
that is, except Mrs. Virginia 
Flores, wl^o is in Lincoln Heights 



jail for a preliminary hearing 



SUBLIME IDEA ■ 

It was a sublime idea born of 
lofty Idealism, but unrealizable 
in the present state of evolution 
iof human nature dominated by 
! selfishness, hates and loves. 

Only a change of heart In man- 
kind can bring justice, equality 
of rights and opportunities, and 
peace 

Only In war and for war, but 
not in peace or for peace, will 
peoples and nations 'make su 
promo sacrifices. 

The atomic bomb Is the Frank 
enstein monster of the age. 

WEB OF POLITICS 

It is inextricably entangled In 
the web of postwar international 
politics in Europe and Asia. 

It was brought into the world 
by America, Britain and Canada. 

Over the Japanese cities of Hi 
roshima and Nagasaki, America 
demonstrated and set an example 
of its efficient, effective but hor 
ribly destructive use when _lt re 
ported that 200,000 lives, one- 
third of them women and chil- 
dren, were snuffed out or, died 
lingering deaths later. 

The most that can be said for 
it is that it may have saved many 



other war. 

Almost universally, it is con- 
sidered a thing of evil, bom of 
war, baptized in horror, and is 
the living black fear that haunts 
the world. 

Future users will point to 
America as justification. 

As long as America, Britain 
and Canada have the cosmic se- 
cret exclusively, they should hold 
It firmly and guard it closely. 

(Mr. Von Wiegand will continue 
this article in tomorrow’s Exam- 
iner.)

The reward to Garza, who had 



met Mrs. Flores with the child

through the Goss Coated Fab- 
rics Company, Mrs. Garcia's em- 
ployers, and was paid to the dis- 
charged sailor yesterday by

♦ 

I went down to Mac Arthur's Manila 
headquarters a few days later to compli- 
ment him and ask instructions. He told me 
to continue training my Philippine Di- 
vision in combat tactics and added that I 
would eventually be placed in charge of 
three new divisions in South Luzon. Grun- 
ert was to be given command of the North 
Luzon force. 

One day in September I was staging 
a field exercise for my Philippine Division 
when MacArthur drove up in his air-condi- 
tioned Chrysler and called me over to the 
car. 

“General Grunert is going to be re- 
turned to the States,” he said. 

“Yes?” 

“And that will make you the senior 
field commander,” he went on. 

I nodded. Then he told me I could have 
my choice of forces. I thought a moment. 

Pick Vital Spot 

“Which do ^ou consider the most im- 
portant point in the Philippines to de- 
fend?” I asked. “Where do you think the 
main danger is . . . the place where some 
distinction can be gained?” 

“The North Luzon force, by all 
means,” he answered. 

“I’d like that,” I said. 

“It’s yours, Jonathan,” MacArthur 
agreed. “But for the time being I want 
you to stay with your division and com- 
plete the plans for your December ma- 
neuvers. In the meantime, I’ll keep Gen- 
eral King up at Fort Stotsenburg to or- 
ganize things for you.” 

By November 25, my staff and I com- 
pleted arrangements for the December ma- 
neuvers. The problems had been worked 
out and the grounds inspected. But those 
maneuvers, like so many other things, 
were doomed. 

On the morning of November 25, two 

weeks before Pearl Harbor, MacArthur 

called me at my Fort McKinley office.

dramatic story of the Fall of the 
Philippines, where the 62 -year-old 
Hero of Bataan and Corregidor won 
the world’s acclaim for his stand, 
and its sympathy for his eventual 
captivity. 

Today’s article deals with the 
tragic unpreparedness of Wain-

“I can go just as quickly as I can

Oct. 8. — President Truman to- 
night declared without reser- 
vation that the United States 
will never share its atomic 
bomb secret with any other 
nation. 

The Chief Executive made his 
momentous announcement at an 
informal press conference at the 
fishing lodge where he is spend- 
ing a two- day rest. 

The President said that the 
United States secret of the 
atomic bomb is the industrial 
know-how of how to build and 
put together and operate the 
bomb and that that secret will 
never be given to the world 
The President said that neither 
Britain nor Canada, although they 
have shared in the atomic energy 
research, would be able to make 
the atomic bomb. 

That, he said, applies to all 
countries. 

At the same time, the Presi- 
dent said that he is highly opti- 
mistic concerning the threshing 
out of vexing international prob- 
lems and that he does not con- 
sider that the Big Five confer 
cnce of foreign ministers in Lon 
don was in any way a failure. 

He said that there have never 
been any clashes of interest with 
Russia — that Russia and the 
United States have always been 
friends and he hopes they will 
remain so. 

Mr. Truman held his press con- 
ference on the front porch of the 
fishing lodge of Mrs. Linda Mor- 
ris near the shores of this lake 
resort.

Earlier arrangements to return

she would be in better condition

Mrs. Mansfeldt, mother of 
three teen -aged children, was 
taken to the hospital when she 
collapsed, screaming hysterically, 
after learning that her husband 
had killed himself.

years service. 

The War Department represen- 
tative informed the House mili- 
tary committee that this was 
probably the earliest date at 
which the new system could be 
placed into effect. 

Members pressed Berry for an 
exact date after receiving assur- 
ances last month from General 
Marshall, Army chief of staff, 
that two-year men would be let 
out beginning in "late winter.’' 

‘ ESCAPE ’ PLAN 



The only two-year men who 
will be discharged before March, 
Berry indicated, are service men 
with sufficient points and those 
deemed “surplus’’ to Army re- 
quirements. 

Berry emphasized that com- 
paratively few men would be 
discharged as “surplus” and ex- 
plained that this was just “an 
escape mechanism" to permit the 
Army to get rid of men "whom 
we cannot use.” 

Berry declared that at least 
14,000 physicians will be dis- 
charged from the Army by 
Christmas. 

He said approximately 1000 
doctors were discharged last 
week, and that the rate is con- 
tinually going up. 

He said that physicians have 
been given “the highest priority,” 
and are being flown home by 
plane and that 6000 have returned 
from Europe since V-E Day.

Legislature Group Demands 
Action as 78 Hurt in Row 



Another dav of bloodv rioting on the Warner 
Brothers Studio battlefront of Hollywood’s jurisdic- 
tional labor strife yesterday sent 78 men and women 
to hospitals for first aid — and culminated last night 
in flat official charges that the whole strike is “Com- 
munist-inspired and dominated!” 

The charge was incorporated in a telegram sent 
to Governor Warren by Senators Jack B. Tenney of 
Los Angeles and Hugh M. Burns of Fresno and As- 
semblyman Fred H. Kraft of San Diego, comprising 
a subcommittee of the State Committee on Unamer- 
ican Activities. 

The legislators investigated the strike situation 
in person, and were witnesses of the dawn brawl

which spilt blood and cracked heads and bashed 
noses, when 400 11011 -strikers sent a flying wedge 
against the strikers’ picket line in an effort to get 
into the studio to their jobs. 

Five minutes after that clash had stalled, an- 
other 120 men — uniformed police and deputies — 
charged from inside the studio, and in a 20-minuto 
riotous, bitter battle, cleared a lane through which 
nearly 600 workers made their way into the studio 
during the morning. 

Result of their observance of yesterday’s war 
fare, and also a month-long investigation, the 
legislators’ telegram to Governor Warren last night 
read as follows: 

“After thorough investigation of jurisdictional 
strike situation at Warner Brothers Studio, a sub- 
committee of the State Committee on Unamerican 
Activities is convinced that the strike is Commu-

Senators Tenney and Burns

Said Senator Burns after- 
ward: “The scene is flooded 
with Communist literature — 
leaflets signed by the Holly-

announcing the strikers have 
the backing of other Commu- 
nist front organizations. While 
the law provides for peaceful

cident Injuring 50 people could 
be classified as peaceful picket-

simple, and law enforcing 
agencies should take appropri- 
ate action.” 

Said Assemblyman Kraft : 
“It’s a deplorable condition out 
there. I ought to take some 
veterans out and show 'them

for. The Sheriff ought to nfove

78 INJURED 

Of the 78 persons injured in 
yesterday morning’s riot. 10 were 
treated at Burbank Emergency 
Hospital, 68 inside the studio in- 
firmary, officials tated. The 
hurts ranged from one man’s 
seriously crushed chest, putting 
him in “critical” condition, to a 
long list of minor cuts and 
bruises and wounds. 

The strikers’ leader. Herb Sor- 
rell. suffered a gashed forehead 
and blackened eye and Warner 
Brothers’ nationally noted dance 
director, Leroy Prinz, had his 
scalp creased by a bottle. 

But as a result of the crashing 
of the picket line, studio officials 
announced in late afternoon, 
some 600 persons had gotten into 
the plant to work ar.d production 
had been resumed on three 
movies. Last night about 400 of 
the workers returned to their 
homes — but the other 200, rather 
than run the picketline gauntlet 
again, elected to stay inside the 
walls and accept the studio’s of- 
fer of lodging and meals. The 
property department supplied 
beds. 



CHAIN , CABLES- 



T 



Yesterday’s dawn melee was a 
bitter one, and one of the bloodi- 
est and most vicious of the 
clashes that have occurred since 
violence broke out at the Warner 
Brothers lot entrance last Friday. 
Both sides, it seemed from the 
bitterness which permeated the 
scene, were “set” for the early 
morning outbreak. 

Long before 6 a. m., non- 
strikers had begun to assemble 
in a parking lot across Olive 
street from the main studio en- 
trance. Many had armed them- 



were 200 and more men and wom- 
en in a double picket line that 
blocked the main studio gate. 

Screaming, shouting, the two 
groups went into action. Fists 
flew and feet kicked. Heads 
cracked under sticks; cheeks were 
ripped open as chains and cables 
swung. Down went men and 
women and others trampled them. 

But no tear-gas bombs, no fire 
hoses went into action. The 
strikers had obtained an injunc- 
tion against their use; the au- 
thorities obeyed. But the studio 
had also obtained an injunction 
last week limiting the number of 
pickets to 18. That injunction was 
NOT obeyed.

Five minutes after the brawl- $ JAILED FRIDAY 
ing began when the two forces 



shoulders and carried them as 
heroes, while women in the picket 
line kissed them until their faces 
were lipstick-smeared like a 
sailor’s on V-Day. They gave 
their names as Sergeant Gordon 
McLean, Harry Fink and Earl 
Myers. 

During the morning union loud- 
speakers began denunciations of 
Sheriff Eugene Biscailuz, as well 
as studio officials. 

By late morning relative quiet 



clashed, a third force entered the 
battle. From inside the studio, 
120 men in uniform — studio po- 
lice, sheriff's deputies, police — 
came charging into the fray. 
Their night clubs and billies 
swung steadily, and the thudding 
of fists and cracking of skulls as 
billies found their mark re- 
sounded over the yells and the 
blaring of loudspeakers. 

Little by little, as minute after 
minute of bloody battling went 
on, the uniformed and nonstrik- 
ing forces overpowered the pick- 
ets. After 20 minutes, the battle 
died out — and there stood a dou- 
ble line of uniformed authorities, 
guns at their sides, billies and 
clubs in their hands, clearing a 
wide lane across Olive street into 
the studio gate. 

Through this lane, nearly 500 
men and women workers went 
into the studio. 

Outside the lines the pickets 
and strikers jeered, cat -called, 
booed and voiced insults. 

Their loud-speaker truck 
screamed: “If the rats and finks 
uaht to go in, let ’em in. Don’t 
lay hands on ’em. We’ll remem- 
ber ’em!” 

At the same time a studio 
sound truck roared its own r chal 
lenge: 

“Anybody who wants to re

They were R. H. Lougsdon, 32, 



3554 Pasadena avenue, charged 
with carrying a deadly weapon; 
Ray S. Farley, 40, 4946 Collis 
avenue, South Pasadena, and 
Robert T. Harkness, 24, 3451 
Pasadena avenue, both charged 
with carrying concealed wea- 
pons. All three pleaded not 
guilty, and their trials were set 
for November 15 in Burbank 
Police Court. 

During yesterday’s brawling, 
Attorney Ben Margolis, repre- 
senting the unions, forced his 
way into the studio grounds, 
shouting that pickets had been 
arrested illegally and were bejng 
held in the studio. He was 
ejected by uniformed men, ’and 
left threatening to take action 
against studio officials. 

After yesterday’s early morn- 
ing riot there was another dem

time from their original line 



across the studio entrance, to 
now line ‘that paralleled the 
guards’ line across ©live street. 
That thoroughfare, main line 
from Cahuenga Pass into the val 
ley and to the Lockheed air ter 
minal, was blocked; traffic had 
to be rerouted and detoured. 

Late yesterday, as a courtroom 
sideline to the strike disorders, 
Attorneys Freston and Files, rep- 
resenting Warner Brothers, filed 
a return in Superior Court, re 
porting that eight unions and 
their officials had been duly 
served with last week’s injunc- 
tion, forbidding mass picketing in 
excess of 18 pickets at the studio 
gates. 



tion of wartime earnings. 

It was announced tonight that 
Economic Stabilizer John C. Col- 
let will call a meeting of wage, 
reconversion, price and labor of- 
ficials within the next day or two 
to chait the Government’s course 
on labor's request for a 30 per 
cent wage boost to offset the loss 
of war premiums. 



CONFERENCE- 



Collet, who stepped into the 
Office of Economic Stabilization 
only a week ago, conferred dur- 
ing the day with War Labor 



Board Chairman George W. Tay- 
lor and Secretary of Labor Lewis 
B. Schwelienbach. 

Schwellenbach said that a full- 
scale meeting of all interested 
Federal agencies will be held to- 
morrow or the next day to seek 
an answer to the reconversion 
wage problem which has brought 
strikes and threats of strikes in 
major industries. 

Currently, the Government's 
postwar wage policy permits 
wage boosts which do not require 
price increases. If a price change 
is involved the wage adjustments 
must go before OES for approval. 
Labor’s demand for a 30 per cent 
pay increase to make up for 
shorter peacetime hours and the

resultant loss of overtime falls 
within the latter category, ac 
cording to industry. 

TEST CASE ’ 



There are two ways of ap- 
proaching the answer to the 
problem, Taylor said. One is 
through the so-called -“test case” 
method of sending individual 
wage 'cases through the WLB- 
OPA-OES machinery to a final 
ruling. The other Is through the 
advance formulation of an over- 
all policy. 

Just what course will be fol- 
lowed has not yet been decided. 
Although Scliwellen b a c h an- 
nounced last Saturday that he 
would submit a “test case” on 
the issue to the WLB, the board 
feels that there are many obsta- 
cles in the way of this approach.

Placards were dropped quickly 
and the first phase of the strike 
was ended. 

Lieutenant C. E. Ellis, who ac- 
companied Wendel here from San 
Francisco on a Navy plane, was 
assigned as resident officer in 
charge and will administer the 
plant for the Navy.

night continued in effect, with

Pickets were removed at 3:55 
p. in. yesterday, after a series of 



conferences called hurriedly by 
Lieutenant Commander William 
Hall Wendel, U. S. N., sent here 
from San Francisco to represent 
the Navy in seizure of the huge 
refinery. 

John Stark, strikers’ commit- 
tee member, emerged from the 
conference and informed the 
pickets: 

“At the request of the United 
States Navy, and in the inter- 
est of oil and gasoline needed 
by the military, the picket line 
will disperse, and you will pro- 
ceed to our local headquarters 
for back -to -work instructions.”

General Wainwright Reveals His 
Armies Never Had Chance to Win 



(Continued From Page Six) 

IONS OF 75 Mm7gUNS— WAS MOBIL- 
IZED AFTER DECEMBER 8. 

Shortage of Artillery 

BLUE MEL’S INFANTRYMEN 
TRAINED ON AN AVERAGE OF 
THREE OR FOUR WEEKS BEFORE 
BEING FORCED TO FIGHT. HIS EN- 
GINEERS GOT NO TRAINING AT ALL. 
HIS ARTILLERY NEVER FIRED A 
PRACTICE SHOT; INDEED, ITS FIRST 
SHOT WAS AIMED IN THE GENERAL 
DIRECTION OF THE APPROACHING 
ENEMY. 

His infantry had no combat practice, 
no combat training, little or no rifle or ma- 
chine gun practice. There .was no infantry- 
artillery team training. 

As was the case with all other Philip- 
pine Army divisions which fought under 
me, the Thirty-first Division did not have 
a full complement of artillery. What guns 
it had — British 75 mm.’s and 2.95-incli 
mountain howitzers — were obsolete. There 
was little means of transportation for any 
artillerv. 

This Was Our Problem 

The Seventy-first and Ninety-first Di- 
visions were badly undermanned. They 
were made up of men from Leyte and Sa- 
mar and came north minus an infantry regi- 
ment each. None of my divisions had an 
anti-tank battalion. None bad anything like 
the required transportation and signal com- 
munication equipment. They were all short 
of ammunition, but with the exception. of 
certain vital types we received a store of 
this in the nick of time through the efforts 
of Colonel (now Brigadier General) Lewis 
Beebe, MacArthur’s assistant chief of staff 
in charge of supply. 

WE WERE TERRIBLY SHORT 
THEN, AND UNDERSTANDABLY 
SHORTER LATER, OF HAND GRE- 
NADES, .50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN 
AND INFANTRY MORTAR AMMUNI- 
TION. WE HAD ONLY A FEW ROUNDS 
OF THE LATTER TYPE, CRITICALLY 
NEEDED IN JUNGLE FIGHTING. WE 
WERE POVERTY-STRICKEN, TOO, IN 
AMMUNITION FOR THE 2.95 HOWITZ- 
ERS, FOR THESE WERE OBSOLETE 
GUNS AND THE AMMUNITION FOR 
THEM NO LONGER WAS BEING 
MADE. 

We got practically no transportation 
for any purpose; hardly a truck, hardly a 
car. My command, destined to receive the 
forthcoming blow of perhaps a quarter of a 
million well-equipped J apanese troops, sup- 
ported by warships and an air force in full 
charge of the skies, was spread over an area 
75 miles from north to south and 100 miles 
from east to west. 

Officers Inexperienced 

BUT THE ONLY MEANS OF COM- 
MUNICATION WITH THE VARIOUS 
DIVISIONS WAS THROUGH THE PUB- 
LIC TELEPHONE LINES. 

To top everything, the main bulk of my 

men were not onlv untrained but undisci- 

* 

plined, and were led by extremely inexperi- 
enced Filipino officers. 

WHAT I AM SAYING IS THIS: THE 



PHILIPPINE ARMY UNITS WITH THE 
NORTH LUZON FORCE WERE 
DOOMED BEFORE THEY STARTED TO 
FIGHT. THAT THEY LASTED AS LONG 
AS THEY DID IS A STIRRING AND 
TOUCHING TRIBUTE TO THEIR GAL- 
LANTRY AND FORTITUDE. 

THEY NEVER HAD A CHANCE 
TO WIN. 

My more detailed inspection of the four 
scattered divisions of the North Luzon force 
was to begin on December 6, 1941. That 
morning I worked around my headquarters 
at Stotsenburg, and though we heard noth-, 
ing from Mae Arthur or Washington, the 
tension could be cut with a knife. 

I did hear that day from Mac Arthur's 
headquarters that the troops in Hawaii had 
been put und^r a sabotage alert. MacAr- 
tkur instructed me through his staff — he 
rarely spoke on the phone himself — to have 
my troops ready to move promptly to their 
beach defenses. 

But his staff officer added that there 
was no need actually to alert them. 

That same morning on December 6, I 
rode over to Clark Field, which is a sort of 
continuation of Stotsenburg. I had been 
riding automobile cushions for a week or 
so and itched to get back on my thorough- 
bred, “Little Boy.” Air Corps Colonels Eu- 
bank and “Rosie” O’Donnell had just ar- 
rived at Clark Field, leading a flight of 36 
B-17’s. I talked to Eubank for a time about 
the flight, a perilous one in those days. But 
I had nothing to do with the air forces. 
They were commanded by Major General 
Lewis H. Brereton, who was responsible to 
MacArthur. 

'The Cat Has Jumped' 

On the afternoon of December 6 I held, 
an inspection of the Twenty-sixth Cavalry, 
a battery of the Twenty-third Field Artil- 
lery, and one pack train, on the thousand- 
yard-long parade ground at Stotsenburg. 
They were the extent of my units at the fort. 
I turned in about 11 o’clock that Saturday 
night, and I had many occasions later on to 
remember that I got a good night’s sleep. 
•It was the last decent sleep I was to have 
for three years and eight months. 

I worked that next day, Sunday, De- 
cember 7 (which, of course, was Saturday, 




^il M 01d times were not 
the best for these two. General Wainwright chats with 
Brigadier General Lewis Beebe (right) after their 

December 6 — Pearl Harbor time) and fin- 
ished plans for the inspection tour which 
would formally begin the next day. 

At 4:35 a. m. on the morning of Decem- 
ber 8 (which was 7:35 a. m. Sunday morn- 
ing in Pearl Harbor) the phone in the room 
next to my pitch black bedroom rang with 
sharp insistence. I got up and strode for it, 
sensing it was bad news. 

“Yes?” 

It was Colonel Pete Irwin, MacArthur’s 
assistant chief of staff for operations. 

“Admiral Hart (whose Asiatic Fleet 
lay in Manila Bay) has just received a 



return to the United States from Japanese imprison- 
ment. General Beebe was MacArthur’s deputy chief 
of staff who remained on Bataan and was captured.

radio dispatch from Admiral Kimmel 
(commander of the Pacific Fleet at Pearl

I started to dress with one hand. With 
my other hand I jiggled the phone and 
called my aide, Johnny Pugh. 

“Johnny!” 

“Hello? . . . yes, General.”

Business Feeling in Easi- 
Cautious But Optimistic 



BY CARL S. KELTY 

— Financial Editor 



Material costs and labor costs are going up and are bound to 
be reflected by higher prices. That was the feeling encountered 
among leaders in business and industry in the East by Gordon B. 
Crary, E. F. Hutton & Co. part- * 



ner, who has just returned from 
/an extended trip which included 
Chicago, Youngstown, South Bend. 
Dayton, Toledo and New York. 
The consensus was the Govern- 



ment would not object to moderate 



price increases, although he heard 

iMMNK cl( 



no official statement cited for this 
opinion. The Government must 
have profits to tax, was the belief 
widely expressed 

Not all the labor disputes are 



related to wages alone, Mr. Crary 
found. The New York elevator 



strike, for example, was against 

Lai 



bor 



an order issued by the War 
Board. i 

The chief impact of walkouts 
Was found in the slowing of re- 
conversion, which industrialists do 
not like. 

* * * 

What industrialists objected 'to 
he remarked, was the slowing 
down of reconversion by the labor 
troubles, and what they were talk- 
ing of most was the inability to 



get materials to build up stockpiles 

r< 



Tor increased production. 

“Having in mind the difficulties 
and uncertainties, sentiment was 
one of optimism,'’ Mr. Cmry 
commented. "They are planning 
ahead regardless. 

“I am sure If they have half 
a chance they are going to sur- 
prise the public with the speed 
of reconversion and volume of 
production just as they did In 
converting to war production.” 

* * * 

The Hutton partner said he 
found the same optimism market- 
ed se as prevailed in industry, al- 
though as average prices near the 
|937 peaks a note of caution is 
manifested, Irrespective of opti- 
mism. Well-advised investors are 
teeplng a part of their resources

been unable to determine their

the Industry favors keeping prices

pects of the carriers were far bet

their securities indicated. Exten 
slve studies made by analysts of 
the effect of debt reauction on the 
railroads’ fixed charges were most 
encouraging, he said.

NEW YORK, Oct. 8.— (JP)— Ac- 
tive demand for steels, metals, 
rails and assorted industrials 
sent today’s stock market to a new 
eight-year high with gains rang- 
ing from fractions to around a 
point and more. 

Strength also appeared in some 
aircrafts and utilities, farm im- 
plements, chemicals, oils and spe- 
cialties. 

Investors paid little attention to 
the gloomy strike situation. Even 
a scheduled drop of 8.2 per cent 
•in* steelmaking this week because 
of the shortage of bituminous coal 
failed to cause much gelling. 

Several stocks hit new highs for 
1945 or longer, including United 
States Steel. Bethlehem, Anaconda, 
Kennecott, Silver King, Loew’s and 
Pepsi-Cola. Motors were up sub- 
stantially most of the time, but 
Chrysler ended off % and Gen- 
eral Motors was unchanged.

Reconversion will be facilitated to the extent that harmony

Maynard Keynes, who is now ia 
Washington on a financial mission. 

Any real assurance of a politictl 
philosophy, leading to pro«p«cti 
for a reasonably stable dolly, j 
would give the average citizen • ' 
better mooring, and might be c*t [ 
culated to calm down the prevailing 
restlessness. 

* * * 

Up to now, responsible officials 
have couched the alleged battH 
against inflation too much in term* 
of preventing the results and symp- 
toms from catching hold. That ia a 
time serving attitude. 

The time has come to think in 
terms of fundamental casual fao- 
tors. The occasion^la opportune for 
stopping inflation at the souree 
through greatly reducing and then _ 
eliminating Federal deficits. # C

During the war, when economic _ 
controls aborted free enterprise, r*- urii 
tloning introduced a second type.(} e n er ;

While dollars were issued In larg- terday

goods and services available for 
civilians, a second type of morsflce*, i

ration coupons, was issued for J 
scarce items. patient

In this category, the supplemen- -j vpri

was definitely related in quantity from t 
to the supply of such rationed goods — 
available for civilians. Thus, for ra- An ® 
tioned items, such as shoes Rndgrror, 1 
sugar, the dollar no longer re* v 
mained effective purchasing power >»ortn 
unless implemented by the ration /ni^nn 
coupon. Thus, in a sense, by Fed- 
eral ukase the buying power ofiystem 
money was temporarily restricted,

" ell, my little girl went off to school last week for the 
first time and when the teacher drove up for her, it was all 
I could do to keep from going with her* And when I saw the 
teacher, it got tougher. 

A lot of radio stars’ kids go to .his school and it affected 
the whole program. Instead of starting with a bell, they open 
with a brief commercial for a pencil company. 

I told the teacher I wanted Linda to learn a lot and be 
as smart as her daddy. She said if that was aU I wanted, they 
could have her home at noon. 

And it appears that my bringing home souvenirs from 
overseas trips had a bad influence on the children, because 
when Linda came home last night, she was wearing the 
principal’s spats, the teacher’s glasses and carrying six colored 
maps of the Middle Atlantic states.

Supposed Wrong Bottle Death

in larg- terday that, with the assistance 

Lblc y for the Coronor ’ s and Sheriff’s of-

patient “in the belief she was

table under anesthesia. Death 

followed in minutes. 

“The surgeon instructed the 
nurse to Inject a mild form of 
saline solution to counteract 
shock and prevent Infection,” 
the officials asserted. '"The 

nurse left the patient’s side 
and went to a row of bottles. 

“As the patient’s circulatory 
system collapsed, and convul- 
sions ensued, Immediately after 
the injection, it is considered 
highly probable the nurse in- 
advertently opened the wrong 
bottle and obtained

a more 
potent and hence more danger- 
ous form of the salt solution." 

Dr. Frank R. Webb, Coroner’s 
chief autopsy surgeon, reported 
after an autopsy he had found 
“evidences of a ruptured ap- 
pendix," but no certain cause of 
death. A chemical and micro- 
scopic test of the girl’s vital or- 
gans and skin and flesh tissue is 
pending.

ganization and training of Philippine Army 
units, in which work I had been helping 
since the Philippine Army had begun mo- 
bilization. I got over my old point again, 
about the continuation of training in offen- 
sive combat and the need of doing it as fast 
as possible. 

“Jonathan,” he said, “you’ll prob- 
ably have until about April to train those 
troops.” 

I KNEW MacARTHUR WAS TALK- 
ING ABOUT WAR. 

Looking back on that prediction, and 
remembering hind-sightedlv that the Japs_ 
were even at that hour massing to hit us, 
I’d like to stress this thought: MacArthur 
believed that nothing was going to happen 
before April of 1942. 

HE BELIEVED IT BECAUSE HE 
HAD NO OFFICIAL INFORMATION 
WHICH WOULD HAVE LED HIM TO 
BELIEVE OTHERWISE. HE WAS, I’M 
SURE, COMPLETELY IN THE DARK 
ABOUT THE GRAVITY OF DIPLO- 
MATIC MESSAGES THEN BEING EX- 
CHANGED. IF MacARTHUR HAD 
KNOWN ANYTHING, HE WOULD 
HAVE GIVEN ME— CERTAIN TO BE 
HIT FIRST— WHAT HE KNEW. HIS 
APRIL, 1942, PREDICTION WAS A 
FAIR ONE, I THOUGHT. 

I drove back to Fort McKinley for the 
night and on the morning of November 28 
went on up to Stotsenburg, which lies 65 
miles above Manila. 

No Time for Training 

I thought a lot about MacArthur s 
April guess.- But I knew that even if the 
Japs held off thaf loug it would still be a 
tight squeeze. It takes tune to turn a mass 
of conscripts into the kind of army we would 
need. The minimum time in our Army tor 
training a division is one year, and that 
presupposes good training conditions and ' 
all the necessary gear and able instructors. 

ON MY ARRIVAL AT FORT STOTS- 
ENBURG THAT AFTERNOON TO TAKE 
OVER MV DUTIES, I DISCOVERED 
THAT GENERAL KING HAD BEEN 
ABLE ONLY TO SCRATCH THE SUR- 
FACE OF ORGANIZING THINGS FOR 
ME THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE 
NORTH LUZON FORCE WAS JUST 
ABOUT’ NIL. ALL I HAD TO START 
WITH WERE KING’S POST ADJU- 
TANT. TO SERVE AS ADJUTANT 
GENERAL OF THE NEW FIELD 
FORCE, A SUPPLY MAN AND A SUR- 
GEON. 

I dipped into my old Philippine Di- 
vision and brought out Colonel illiani P. 
Maher as my chief of staff, got the old di- 
vision quartermaster, Lieutenant Colonel 
Alfred Balsam, the commanding officer of 
the Fourteenth Engineers, Lieutenant Colo- 
nel Harry Skerry, and the division’s signal 
officer, Lieutenant Colonel Josh Stausell. 

And went to work. Colonel Maher re- 
ported promptly and was of inestimable 
value in the organization of such a head- 
quarters as we were able to scrape together 
before the war began. 

IN THE LAST DAYS OF NOVEM- 
BER, WHILE COLONEL MAHER EN- 
DEAVORED TO GET EQUIPMENT, I 



* 












PAID QUICK VISITS TO THE FOUR 
DIVISIONS ASSIGNED TO ME. 

They were the Eleventh Division, then 
mobilizing in the Lingayen Gulf area; the 
Twenty-first Division, mobilizing just north 
of Tarlac; the Seventy-first Division, mobil- 
izing at Camp O’Donnell— later a place of 
unspeakable horror— and the Thirty-first 
Division, forming itself on the coastal plain 
west of the Zambalies Mountains, just north 
of Subic Bay. The Ninety-first, Division, 
then mobilizing at Cabanatnan, was at- 
tached to rnv command for training and 
administration, but actually belonged to 
MacAiUliur’s strategic reserve. 

-Let me give you a sample of the training 
status of those divisions on the eve of the 
attack. Nearly a year later, when Brigadier 
General Clifford Bluemel and I were sitting- 
in rags in a Jap prison camp near Tarlac — 
where I* had futilely planned to stage my 
December, 1941, maneuvers — he told me the 
conditions under which his Thirty-first Di- 
vision was formed.

Corregidor Hero Tells of 
First Air Raids 



This is the fourth of General Jona- 
than M. Wainwright's touching series of 
articles on the Fall of the Philippines and 
his own shocking captivity. In today's 
installment the fall, spare Hero of Bataan 
and Corregidor tells of the all-but-uncon - 
tested Jap bombing raid on Clark Field, 
near his post at Fort Sfotsenburg, and he 
sees the first of the copious blood his un- 
prepared and doomed North Luzon force 
was destined to shed.

‘This Is Mr Story 

By Gen. Jonathan M. Wainwright 

(Copyright, 1945, King Features Syndicate, Inc. 
Reproduction in whole or in part strictly prohibited.) 

There were many things to do on the 
morning that Hell broke loose. If I had 
ached before that, for better trained men 
and the proper tools, now the want was be- 
yond ache. 

I had planned to see MacArthur within 
the next day or two to be sure that he real- 
ized just how unprepared we were in North 
Luzon, how low we were in everything that 
goes to make up a man’s army. 

But now that the word of Pearl Harbor 
had come from Manila. I knew I would soon 
be moving north, not south to see Mac- 
Artliur. So I told Johnny Pugh that I 
would make a list of the things I needed 
from MacArthur, and send him to Manila 
to try to get them. 

The Phone Rang Twice 

I sat in my room writing that list, dur- 
ing the predawn of the first day of war. 
The phone rang twice while I scribbled. 
Each call brought progressively worse in- 
formation. The 4:50 a. m. call from Pete 
Irwin told me that the battleship line at 
Pearl Harbor, and our big Hickam Field 
air base, had been heavily bombed. A little 
after 5 o’clock Pete called again to say that 
Admiral Hart had received another mes- 
sage from Admiral Kimmel advising Hart 
not only that a state of war with J apan ex- 
isted but instructing him to “govern your- 
self accordingly.” 

The latter phrase, I think, referred to 
a plan the Navy must have had to withdraw 
its larger surface craft from Manila Bay 
at the start of hostilities. For on that first 
day of war all major surface ships started 
south. 

Call for Ammunition 

A soon as I learned that Hickam had 
been bombed, I called Clark Field, but they 
had been informed. Johnny Pugh came 
over to my quarters about dawn. I gave 
him the list of desperately needed ammuni- 
tion and equipment and told him to rush it 
to Manila. 

“And while you’re down there find 
Tom Dooley and send him back at once,” 

I ordered. 

Tom was in Manila saying good-by to 
a pretty English girl who was sailing for 
Australia, 

Shortly before 9 a, m. Mac Arthur ’s' 
headquarters informed me that Baguio, the 
Philippine summer capital, 95 miles above

As the basis of a p'-- 1 : ianon 
security policy, Marshall reconi 
mended:

ing to make possible the 
emergency mobilization of 4,-

"we ■'Vd establish for • ' .e •

tfrely within the financial capa- 
bilities of our peacetime 
economy and is ABSOLUTELY

TURE, and (2) places the mili- 



tary world and therefore the 
political world on notice that 
this vast power, linked to our 
tremendous resources, wealth 
and production, Is immediately

"There can he no question 
that all the nations of the

accordingly, creating at least 
a probability of peace on earth 
and good will among men 
1 rather than disaster upon dis- 
aster In a tormented world 
1 where the very processes of 
civilization Itself are constantly 
being threatened." 

Emphasizing that Allied victory 
in World War II was achieved 
only after an uphill struggle, 
Marshall said Germany and Ja- 
pan came so close to world dom- 
ination in 1942 that "we do not 
yet realize how thin the thread 
of Allied survival had been 
stretched.” American security 
was saved then, he said, by ocean 
distances, British and Russian 
resistance, and enemy mistakes. 

"We may elect again," he de- 
clared, "to depend on others 
and the whim and error of po- 
~ntlal enemies, hut if we do 
we will be carrying the tress- 
re and freedom of this great 
nation in a paper bag."

Here, in a quick summary, are 
yesterday's principal develop- 
ments: 

1. Expressing a firm belief that 
“city and county authorities can 
and will maintain order," Gov- 
ernor Earl Warren declined to in- 
tervene. Replying by telegram to 
requests of a State Legislative 
Committee, headed by Senator 
Jack Tenney, to "personally in- 
vestigate the outbreaks at War- 
ner Studios, the Governor re- 
ferred the committee to Sections 
726 and 727 of the Penal Code. 
These provide local authorities 
with wide powers to break up as- 
semblages when it appears a riot 
will develop. 

2. On the Warner Brothers 
front, special “roving squads" 
of pickets roamed the neighbor- 
hood, found action which sent six 
men to doctors for treatment. 
Picket lines continued at the stu- 
dio gates. Inside the studio, near- 
ly 500 workers, who are sleeping 
and eating w’ithin the walls, func- 



lated by Homicide Inspector AJ- tioned, butVio pictures were being

Again pickets gathered, sev- 
eral hundred strong, before day- 
light. This time, white-painted 
metal helmets were handed out 
to each picket by the strike com- 
mittee. 

And as an innovation, the pick- 
ets had their “roving squads of 
searchers,’’ who resented being 
called “goons.” These patrolled 
the streets in the studio neigh- 
borhood, frankly on the search 
for men who had participated in 
the flying wedge which broke the 
picket line Monday. Too, the 
strikers had motorcycle riders 
ready to pursue fugitives. 

FLYING FISTS 



These squads, as well as the 
studio pickets, found several indi- 
viduals whose reaction led to 
flying fists. As a result, these 
casualties were reported: 

Harold Noyes, head grip at 
Warners, beaten. 

Dick Enimons, Warners grip, 
beaten. 

Heinle Heinrich, soundman, 
beaten. 

(These three men were taken in 
a police car to where first aid was 
given them.) 

Byron Mason, 35, 10834 Saticoy 
avenue. Van Nuys, treated at 
Burbank Emergency Hospital 
after being kicked in body. 

Macklin Hall Jr., special effects 
man and former original “fat 
boy” with Hal Roach comedies; 
badly beaten. 

Herb Greene,- assistant direc- 
tor. beaten. 





Full shifts arc expected to be 
on duty tomorrow at the Union 
Oil Company of California’s 
$80,000,000 Wilmington refinery, 
seized by the Navy last week 
after a shutdown Tuesday by 
striking C, I. O. employees. 

Full production, however, will 
not be reached until next 
Wednesday or Thursday, it was 
stated by Union Oil officials. The 
plant normally runs 70,000 bar- 
rels of crude oil daily. 

The Texas Company's Wilming- 
ton refinery remained strike- 
bound by the C. I. O. Oil Workers 
International Union, with pickets 
still patrolling. 

A company spokesman said 
there had been some "conversa- 
tion” between its representatives 
and C. I. O. strike leaders, but in- 
sisted there had not been any 
offer to remove pickets, or to re- 
open negotiations. 

Earlier, C. E. Frederick, C. I.

producers said that the situation 
is simply one where one group 
wants to work and another does 
not. 

"because we must continue 
the production of pictures,” a 
producer’s spokesman added, 
“we naturally welcome those 
who want to stay on the Job 



and maintain harmonious rela- 
tions with us and their fellow 
workers. 

"But violence has been used 
against this group, and we,

our own property and the right 
of a major industry to stay In

LIMITED AFFAIRS 

The outbreaks in which these 
Tien were hurt were limited af- 
fairs. There was no mass fight- 
ing during the day. 

The scene was under the eyes 
qf representatives of a group of 
actors, other studio workers, and 
citizens who had, late Monday, 
sent a wire to Harry and Jack 
Warner. The wire aligned the 
signers squarely with the strlk 
ers, protested activities of uni 
formed police, and "warned” the 
studio heads that the battle 
scene would be watched. Signers 
included: 

John Garfield, Sidney Buch- 
man, Edwin Blum. John Wexley, 
living Pichel, Cal Kuhl, Rex 
Ingram, Ted Bliss, Sam Moore, 
Albert Dekker, Howard Koch, 
Don Hartman, Larry Adler,

VISIT BO IT RON 

Later in the day, several 
these telegram signers 
articulate in 



of 

became 
the Mayor’s office 
and the Sheriffs office. 

With C. I. O. Radio Conimenta 
tor AveriH Berman and C. I. O. 
Attorney Ben Margolis as spokes 
men, a dozen of the group visited 
Mayor Fletcher B o w r o n. and 
loudly protested use of Los An- 
geles police in the Warner Broth- 
ers disorders. 

The Mayor advised them that 
*he police were sent under an 
agreement whereby cities and 
counties would use each others’ 
peace officers in case of riot. The 
committee protested that the po 
lice were there before rioting 
took place. Deputy Police Chief 
Henry Eaton replied that when 
the city police arrived, a state of 
riot existed, but that the city po 
lice did not lay hands on any per 
sons during the brawling. 

The committee tlien went to 
the Sheriffs office, where they 
were closeted with Undersheriff 
A. C. Jewell at the very moment 
when, 15 feet away, a producers’ 
delegation was talking with 
Sheriff Eugene Biscailuz. 

The first group protested again 
•^this time, against the use of 
deputies in the strike disorders. 

The producers asked Biscailuz 
for more protection against 
strike violence. On the produc- 
ers’ delegation were Eddie J. 
Mannix, head of the Motion Pic- 
ture Producers Association; B. B. 
-Kahane, of Columbia; Al Wilson 
of Republic: Y. Frank Freeman 
of Paramount ; Joseph M. Schenck

Nothing more than a jurisdic- 
tional row— a dispute between 
two unions over which shall have 
jurisdiction over a group of 78 
screen painters and designers, 
the current Hollywood flimland 
strike has no issue of wages, 
hours, or working conditions. 

Never once, during its five 
months existence from its begin 
ning on March 12. 1945, have the 
involved unions presented to em- 
ployers any demands over these 
matters. 

The strike was called in mid- 
March, after Set Decorators Lo- 
cal 1421, A. F. L., became involved 
In a dispute with Local 44 of 
the International Alliance of The- 
atrical Stage Employees (LATSE) 
also A. F. L., for jurisdiction over 
the 78 men. Other unions joined 
in the strike, machinists, building 
service employees, carpenters, 
plumbers, office workers, publi- 
cists, 'cartoonists, story analysts, 
electricians and others. 

President William Green of the 
A. F. L. disavowed and outlawed 
the strike, calling it unjustified. 
He said: "It should never have 
occurred and ought to be term- 
inated at once.” But Strike 
Leader Herbert Sorrell ignored 
’ the Green directives, has con- 
” tinued the strike. 

Picketing had been relatively 
peaceful until last Friday, when 
the picket line at Warner Broth- 
ers was suddenly hugely enlarged 
by strike leaders. Warners’ be- 
came a battleground. Since then, 
olood has been spilled virtually 
every day. But the basic issue 
of the strike is still jurisdictional; 
still Involves no question of 
wages, hours or working condi- 
tions; involves only a dispute be- 
tween two A. F. L. uqions as to 
which shall have jurisdiction over 
78 workers. 

Briefly reciting incidents which 
led to Friday’s bloody rioting and 



the ensuing turbulence Monday 
and yesterday, the producers de- 
scribed assaults upon workers — 
union men themselves, who, like 
the strikers, are also members of 
A. F. of L. locals. 

“Whatever are the claims of 
these striking locals," the 
spokesman continued, "they 
cannot, as Americans, claim 
the right to flout the law and 
the rights of other human be- 
ings. The strikers arc flout- 
ing the law. Our studios do 
not Intend to submit to a con- ■ 
tinuance of such action."

Union Oil. 

Frederick claimed Texaco de- 
clined, until the Navy actually 
seized the plant. The union offi- 
cial said the C. L O. was willing 
to resume work at Texaco "when 
the Navy gives the word.” 

BUSMEN TO MEET— 

In reply to this, the Texas 
Company spokesman stated that 
it was awaiting word from Com- 
mander Wendel, direct, in addi- 
tion to removal of picket lines 
before any steps would be taken 
to reopen the plant. 

Last weeks walkouts by 1200 
C. I. O. workers at Union Oil, 
1000 at the Texas Company, and 
1300 at the National Supply Com-

Lewis Offers Plan to End 
50 Pet. of U. S. Coal Strikes 



By AnoiUUd Priti 

A proposal by John L. Lewis 
for settling strikes involving 
nearly half the nation’s soft coal 
miners was announced last night 
and operators asked for addition- 
al time to submit a reply. 

Lewis, in making public his 
terms, whiqh he said were in- 
dorsed by Secretary of Labor 
Schwellenbach, criticized the pro- 
ducers for not accepting them 
immediately. The union leader as- 
serted he and his associates were 
left “waiting at the church” while 
the operators, "filibustered” to 
draft a counter- proposal. 

The proposal provides for the 
return to work of striking mine 
foremen and further negotiation 
on the disputed issue of recogniz- 
ing their union for collective bar- 
gaining purposes.

Pennsylvania, 58,350; Kentucky,

IATSE Determined to Get Workers Past Line 



Determination to get nonstrik- 
ing members of the International 
Alliance of Theatrical Stage Em- 
ployees to work at Warner 
Brothers' studio, despite the 
strike picket lines, was empha- 
sized in a statement yesterday 
by Roy M. Brewer, I. A. T. S. E.’s 
international representative. He 
said: 

"The I. A. T. S. E. did not 
break the picket lines at War- 
ners yesterday. In the first 
place a majority of our men 
remained in Warners the night 
before, rather than create a 
situation similar to the one 
which existed Monday morn-

Long had he loved to fish. 
Long Itad he known how other 
men love to fish. That’s how it 
came about that a man whose 
business is selling paper for a 
paper house began sending fish, 
tng kits to the South Pacific. 

You see, he wanted to make 
some personal contribution to 
the war. He figured his fellow 
anglers would appreciate hard- 
to-get fishing equipment none 
the less because they were in 
uniform and far from their fa- 
vorite streams. Well, sir, he hit 
a jack pot. 

Soon his garage was a shop. 
He drafted his neighbors as a 
staff. His home life vanished be- 
cause he was always out pro- 
moting interest — at lodge, be- 
fore service clubs, anywhere. 
When he should have been 
sleeping he was battling red 
tape to get wire for hooks and ' 
cord for line. Result; 35,000 
fishing kits have gone their way. 

Similarly, a busy manufac- 
turer’s agent finds there arc no 
longer enough hours in the day. 
All because he once thought he 
would gather up a few discard- 
ed games and send them to hos- 
ital and recreational units. At 
ast reports he had forwarded 
some 20,000 games. 

These men arc typical of 
patriotic Americans whose 
numbers run into thousands. 
You never hear of them. Even 
though the war is over, they still 
work constantly and anony- 
mously in the interests of out 
service men. In many cases the 
popularity of an idea makes it 
seem they’ve bitten off more 
than they can possibly chew. 

Yet they simply do not stop. 
They keep on giving their time. 
They keep putting up their own 
money. Some manage single- 
handed. Others wangle help. 
But they keep on doing a job, 
for the need is still great! To 
them we’d like to pay a tribute. 
We’d like to say "Good fot 
you !”

Margarete Clark Urges 
Year's Study of History 

Mrs. Margarete L. Clark, former member of the Los 
Angeles Board of Education, declared yesterday the present 
one-semester United States history course taught in the 
city high schools is grossly inadequate and must be replaced 
by a one-year, two-semester course. 

The former board member said: 

“I don’t think anybody can know too much about 
United States history. The Examiner's survey, published 
In a series of articles, showed clearly what has happened 
in our schools. 

“There has been a stultified, meaningless way of 
teaching history. 

“To be taught properly, United States history must 
be tied up with facts — with the economic life of our coun- 
try, the development of our amazing industrial empire and 
the needs of John Q. Citizen. 

“It must be made interesting — and the teachers must 
be interested in the subject. It should be a rich course, 
vibrant with the glorious stories of the founding of Amer- 
ica — and it must be meaningful. 

“I don’t know why we should have a condition today 
In which history is made dry as dust to the students, and 
- they have to go all over it again when they get into college 
because the high school failed to do the job. 

“People are inclined to take too much for granted 
about their country and the Constitution, the Bill of Rights 
and all the other things that go to make for liberty. 

“The founders of this country fought and bled and 
died to bring about our freedom, but for our future citi- 
zens to preserve it they must have an intelligent concept 
of the struggle their forefathers waged to get it and 
develop a real understanding of what a precious thing 
liberty is. 

“Certainly a year is the minimum that should be 
required. It could be a year filled with tremendous 
importance.”

ALL-VIZUN" LENS 
ENDS BIFOCAL BLUR 

Mirshutz Optometrists own 
rume, "All-Vizun," tells what their 
improved 3-way lenses do. They 
provide dear sight at all distances. 

Now you do not need to tole- 
rate mid-distance blur, experienced 
by many bifocal wearers over 50. 
"All-Vizun" 3-way lenses are espe- 
cially beneficial in window shop- 
ping. housework, and occupations 
where clear arm's length sight is 
required. 

These lenses are ground in Mar- 
shutz Optometrists laboratory, fol- 
lowing a thorough eye examina- 
tion. Established in 1SS7. Mar- 
shutz ground floor offices are at 
418 West 6th Street, between Hill 
and Olive. Those desiring an ap- 
pointment please phone Michigan 
6095. 



Robert E. Gross, Lockheed Air- 
craft Corporation president, made 
that statement yesterday to a 
group of newspaper correspond- 
ents here on a tour of West Coast 
industrial plants. 

"That is particularly true of 
the aircraft Industry,” he added. 

Earlier yesterday the newsmen 
met with John C. Lee. president 
of the Menasco Manufacturing 
Company, who told them: 

“The chief aim of Industry In 
this reconversion era should be 
high productivity. With high 
productivity, prices can be low- 
ered and wages raised, and still 
leave .a fair margin of profit 
for business.” 

He pointed out that in his 
judgment prompt and just OPA 
decisions on price ceilings would 
aid vastly in solving the complex 
problems of reconversion.

placing them with inexperienced 
officers. 

2. Transferred the entire night 
watch of the auto theft bureau, 
“leaving the central auto dis- 
tricts wholly unprotected,” and 
resulting in "almost a 300 per 
cent increase in auto thefts.”

Dancer Held for Kidnap Trial 



Still regarded as “Aunt Mickey" 
by the 5-year-old girl whom she 
abducted from a Los Angeles 
school yard on September 13, Mrs. 
Virginia "Mickey" Flores. 18, 
dancer, appeared in court yester- 
day on a child-stealing charge, 
tnd was ordered held for jury 
.rial. 

Municipal Judge Louis W. Kauf- 
man bound Mrs. Flores over To 
vhe Superior Court after hearing 
testimony that she had lured 
Florence Garcia from the grounds 
of a school at 836 Stanford ave- 
nue, and had kept the child in San 
Diego for three weeks, ignoring 



the published appeals of the des 
perate mother, Mrs. Lita Garcia, 
of 848 South Wall street. 

‘There is Aunt Mickey," chor- 
tled little Florence to her mother 
when she viewed the dancer at 
the preliminary hearing in Judge 
Kaufman’s court, and she re 
counted that Mrs. Flores had 
bought her some dresses and a 
doll. 

Recovery of the child had been 
made possible through the pub- 
lication of her photograph in the 
Examiner. Rudolph C. Garza, a 
sailor, recognized her in San Di- 
ego and notified police.

Almost everybody you meet nowadays is all hopped up 
about the new mechanical super-gadgets that will soon be 
bouncing around in the postwar world, so, before all the sci- 
entists and engineers work themselves into nervous break- 
downs, I'd like to offer them, absolutely free, a few Ideas of 
my own. For instance, why don’t they build: 

(1) A small, portable version of Boulder Dam which would 
bo hitched up to Betty Hutton and ’thereby harness enough 
energy to furnish free poufcr to the entire state of Calif ontiu. 

(2) A pair of elevator shoes for Fred Allen so hell be tall 
enough to see over the bags under his eyes. 

(3) A special time-lock that would positively prevent 
Hedy Lamarr’s shades from being pulled down until 10:30 
p. m. (I have to be home by then, anyway ) 

(4) A pipeline from the blood bank to Sinatra’s house, 
so he wouldn’t have to wear himself out every morning 
walking down there.

Governor Earl Warren was yes-

mission to see to it that motor- 
ists get two license plates for 
their cars next year. 

The commission adopted a 
resolution stating that lack of 
a front plate handicapped the 
officers in recovering stolen cars, 
in running down criminals and in 
enforcing traffic laws. The reso- 
lution also went to police chiefs 
in other cities, suggesting that 
they take similar action.

LIQUEUR it s-m-e-o-t-k 



LOMITA, Oct. 9.— Another 91 
Japanese-Ameridans, all former 
residents of the Los Angeles 
area, returned today. 

Arriving in Los Angeles by 
train from the Ameche Reloca- 
tion Center in Colorado to which 
they were evacuated soon after 
the Pearl Harbor bombing, they 
were brought here in two buses 
by the War Relocation Authority. 

Because they were unable im- 
mediately to resume living in 
their old homes, they were given 
temporary quarters in the aban- 
doned Lomlta Army Air Strip 
barracks by arrangement with 
the Federal Public Housing 
Authority. 

18 FAMILIES 

Eighteen families were includ- 
ed among the 91 Nisei and for 
elgn-born Nipponese. Nearly all 
the families returned with babies 
one, two and three years old 
that were born at the Ameche 
Center. 

Given $25 "assistance money” 
by the War Relocation Authority 
immediately on their arrival, each 
family of two or more was re 
quired to pay $15 for a month’s 
rent in advance, plus a $10 de- 
posit. 

Llewellyn Kin 
Contests Will 

William Llewellyn, co- founder 
of the Llewellyn Iron Works, was 
“unduly Influenced’’ to will his 
entire $125,000 estate to his 
brother, David E. Llewellyn, ac- 
cording to a contest of his will 
filed in Superior Court by Reese 
L. Milner, a nephew. 

The contest cited a previous 
will In which Milner and his sis- 
ter. socialite Mrs. Gwendolyn M. 
Cheesewright, were left th* bulk 
of the estate, with minor bequests 
to two servants, and David 
Llewellyn being left $10,000 in 
War Bonds, a diamond ring and 
club stock. 

The earlier will, dated March 
11, 1943, stated that Milner and 
Mrs. Cheesewright had been 
reared in the William Llewellyn 
family home and “were as close 
to me as if they were my own 
children,” the contest stated. The 
contested will is dated March 12. 

William Llewellyn died last 
September 11 at the age of 78.

LAWN JUST AS THEY ROARED OVER 
THE BACK-DROP OF THE ZAMBALES 
MOUNTAINS. THERE WERE ABOUT 
80 OF THEM, BOMBERS MAINLY, BUT 
ALSO DIVE BOMBERS AND FIGHT- 
ERS. THEY SWEPT OVER STOTSEN- 
BURG, SHAKING THE GROUND, AND 
LET THEIR BOMBS GO ON CLARK 
FIELD— MOST OF WHOSE BOMBERS 
WERE ON THE GROUND. 

The elap came to Clark Field with his 
biggest bombs. The very air of Stotsen- 
burg rattled with concussion. In the midst 
of the almost uucontested raid my Filipino 
boy, Felemon San Pedro, ran startled from 
the house, his eyes like big black marbles. 
Tn his frenzy he had put on my stool helmet. 

“Mother of God, General, what shall 
I do?” he shouted. 

“Go get me a bottle of beer,” I yelled. 
It seemed to help him. I know the beer 
helped me. 

1 drained it, handed him the bottle and 
walked over to my headquarters. The No. 
1 gun of 1 ho battery protecting the parade 
grounds stood quite close to my headquar- 
ters. I went over and stood near it, watch- 
ing the black bursts of our modest anti- 
aircraft fire trying to follow the Jap bomb- 
ers.

“Get this man to the doctor,” I 
ordered. 

Fitch and someone else put their hands 
under the lad, but the hoy •then stirred, 
opened his eyes and wiped a dirty hand 
across his face. 

“No,” the boy said, sharply. “Stay 
by my gun . . . stay by my gun.” 

While this was happening, Tom Dooley 
drove up with a screeching of brakes and 



jumped out of his car. I saw from the direc- 
tion in which he came that he must have 
driven right past Clark Field. 

“Tom, you damned fool, you didn’t 
drive past Clark during this bombing, did 
you?” I shouted at him angrily. 

“Sure, sir,” he said. “You sent me 
orders to report to you as fast as I could,

of those bombs.”

Marshall Outlines 



Security Policy 



(Continued From Page One) 



World War n fitted the require- 
ments of victory so exactly that 
every American division was ih 
the European and Pacific oper- 
ational theaters when the Ger- 
mans surrendered, and all but 
two had been in action. 

“Even with two-thirds of the 
German army engaged by Rus- 
sia, it took every man the na- 
tiem saw fit to mobilize to do 
our part of the job in Europe 
and at the same time keep the 
Japanese under control in the 
Pacific. 

“What wouid have been the 
result had the Red army been 
defeated and the British is- 
lands invaded, we can only 
guess. The possibility is rather 
terrifying.” 

TOO GREEDY 

$ 

General Marshall said, how- 
ever, that events have demon- 



strated that the Axis "existed on 
paper .only,” and that Germany, 
Japan and Italy were each too 
greedy for loot to agree on an 
over-all strategic plan to accom- 
plish their common objective. 

Although the enemy nations 
had an overwhelming advantage 
In materiel at the start of the 
war. Marshall said the U. S. 
Army was so well armed and 
well equipped during the past two 
f years that it "dared to mount 
operations all over the world with 
a strategic inferiority in numbers 
of troops.” 

“Overshadowing all other 
technological advance of the 
war.” Marshall said, “was the 
Allied development of the 
atomic explosive. 

“The harnessing of atomic 
power should give Americans 
confidence in their destiny, hut 
at the same time we must be 
extremely careful not ,to fall 
victim to overconfidence. 

ONLY DEFENSE 

“This tremendous discovery 
will not be ours exclusively in- 
definitely.” 

The chief of staff said the 
availability of atomic power and 
the development of other fearful 
weapons of destruction will lead 
to the “highly dangerous and at- 
tractive doctrine” that the United 
States can rely on machine power 
for defense and will not need 
manpower. 

“The only effective defense a 
nation can now maintain is the 
power of attack,” he declared? 
“That power cannot be in ma- 
chinery alone. There must be 
men to man the machines. 

“If this nation is ever again 
at war, suffering the disas- 
trous attacks of rocket-pro- 
pelled weapons with explosive 
power like our own atomic 
bomb. It will bleed and suffer 
perhaps to the point of annihi- 
lation, unless wo can move ar- 
mies of men into the enemy’s 
bases of operations and seize 
the sites from which he launch- 
es his attacks.” 



other continents In a matter 
of hours. 

“The Navy, now the strong- 
est in the world, will protect 



attack 

enemy 



our shores against* 
from any ampliibloul 
who might challenge through 
the sea approaches, hut we 
must also be prepared to op- 
pose stratospheric envelop- 
ment . . . 

“It Ls elear that the only de- 
fense against this kind of war- 
fare Is the ability to attack. 
We must secure our nation by 
ourselves developing and main- 
taining the weapons, troops 
and techniques required to 
warn aggressors and deter 
them from launching a modern 
devastating war against us.” 
General Marshall expressed the 
belief that efforts of the United 
Nations to establish an interna 
tional system for preventing 
wars has a greater chance of 
success than any previous effort 
of its kind in history. 

“However,” he said, "these 
hopes are by no means certain- 
ties. If man does find the solu- 
tion for world peace it will be 
the most revolutionary reversal 
of his record we have ever 
known. 

“Our own responsibilities to 
these efforts are great. Our 
diplomacy must he wise and it 
must be strong. Nature tends 
to abhor weakness. The prin- 
ciple of the survival of the fit 
is generally recognized. 

“If our diplomacy is not 
backed by a sound security- 
policy, it is, In my opinion, 
forecast to failure. We have 
tried since the birth of our 
nation to promote our love of 
peace by a display of weak- 
ness. This course has failed us 
utterly, cost us millions of 
lives and billions of treasure. 

"We must, if we are to realize 
the hopes we now dare have 
for lasting peace, enforce our 
will for peace with strength, 
we must make it clear to the 
potential gangsters of the 
world that if they dare break 
our peace they will do so at 
their great peril. 

“. . . There Is no alternative 
but that this nation must be 
prepared to defend its interest 
against any nation or combina- 
tion of nations which might 
sometime feel powerful enough 
to attempt the settlement of 
political arguments or gain re- 
sources or territory by force of 
arms. 



lligliligltts oK Staff Chief's Sleport 



f £flg Altgglflg Sxamittgf * Wed., Oct. 10, 1945 Part 



WASHl!SGTOI\\ Oct. 9.— a*— Here are some sali- 
ent sentences from the biennial report of General George 
C. Marshall, Army Chief of Staff: 

This discovery (atomic power) of American scien- 
tists can be man’s greatest benefit. And it can destroy 
him. It is against the latter terrible possibility that this 
nation must prepare or perish. 

★ ,★ ★ 

The developments of the tenr have been so incred- 
ible that wildest imagination will not project us far from 
the target in estimating the future. 

★ ★ ★ 

It will be said that to protect itself this nation need 
only rely on its machine power, that it will not need man- 
power. This doctrine will be closely akin to the doctrine 
of negative defense which destroyed France. 

★ ★ ★ 

The only effective defense a nation can now main- 
tain is the power of attack. And that power cannot be in 
machinery alone. There must be men to man the 
machines. 

★ ★ ★ 

This nation’s destiny clearly lies in a sound perma- 
nent security policy. In the IV ar Department’s proposal 
there are two essentials: (1) Intense scientific research 
and development; (2) a permanent peacetime citizen 
Army. 



ALL AMERICANS CAN, IN THE NEXT GEN- 
ERATIONS, PREPARE THEMSELVES TO SERVE 
THEIR COUNTRY IN MAINTAINING THE PEACE 
OR AGAINST THE TRAGIC HOUR WHEN PEACE IS 
BROKEN. . . . TOTS IS WHAT IS MEANT BY UNI- 
VERSAL MILITARY TRAINING. IT IS NOT UNI- 
VERSAL MILITARY SERVICE— THE ACTUAL IN- 
DUCTION OF MEN INTO COMBATANT FORCES. 
SUCH FORCES WOULD BE COMPOSED DURING 
PEACETIME OF VOLUNTEERS. THE TRAINEES 
WOULD BE IN A SEPARATE ORGANIZATION FOR 
TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY. 

★ ★ ★ 

An unbroken period of one year’s training appears 

essential to the success of a sound security plan based 
on the concept of a citizen' Army. 

★ ★ ★ 4 

The Regular Army must be comprised largely of a 
strategic force, heavy in air power, partially deployed 
in the Pacific and the Caribbean ready to protect the 
nation against a sudden hostile thrust and immediately 
available for emergency action wherever required. 

★ ★ ★ 

The security of the United States of America teas 
saved by sea distance , by Allies and by the errors of a 
prepared enemy. . . . We may elect again to depend on 
others, but if we do we will be carrying the treasure and 
freedom of this great nation in a paper bag. 



ners, who have taken every 
conceivable factor into consid- 
eration, believe that our posi- 
tion will he sound if we set up 
machinery which will permit 
the mobilization of an Army of 
4,000.000 men within a period of 
one year following any interna- 
tional crisis resulting in a na- 
tional emergeney for the Unit- 
ed States.” 

Marshall said the regular Army 
would be largely a strategic 
force, heavy in air power, par 
tially deployed in the Pacific and 
Caribbean to protect the nation 
against a sudden hostile thrust 
The regular Army would also 
provide security garrisons for 
outlying island bases, furnish the 
higher headquarters to keep the 
machine and plans up to date, 
and provide the expert personnel 
for the training of citizen -sol- 
diers. 

SECURITY POLICY— 

General Marshall said the War 
Department wants the American 
Armies of Occupation and the 
U. S. complement of an inter 
national security force to be 
composed as largely as possible 
of volunteers. 

This can be accomplished, he 
said, by putting the regular 
military establishment on a new 
permanent basis, and by setting 
up a peacetime security policy 
so that demobilization of the war- 
time army can proceed without 
interruption. 



SIZE OF ARMY- 



ATOMIC POWER 

General Marshall said the j 
achievements of American sci- 
entists in releasing atomic energy 
“can he man’s greatest benefit 
“And it can destroy him,” he 
declared. “It is against the lat- 
ter terrible possibility that tills 
nation must prepare or perish. 
Atomic power will affect the 
peaceful life of every Individual 
ofi earth, and it will at the same 
time affect every instrument 
and technique of destruction. ’ 

He said that the harnessing of 
the atom would spur efforts to 
“use brain for brawn” in national 
defense, but will not lessen the 
need for manpower in the armed 
forces or in war production. 

He pointed out that 98 per cent 
of the 75 , 000,000 or 80 . 000,000 

Americans directly involved in 
the prosecution of the war, 
counting those in war produc- 
tion, were engaged in technolog- 
ical warfare, and that of the mili- 
tary mobilization of 14,000.000 
men, only 1,500,000 were infantry 
troops. 

‘The effect of technology 
on the military structure,” ho 
said, “is identical to Its effect 
on the national economy. Just 
as the automobile replaced 
the horse and made work for 
millions of Americans, the 
atomic explosives will 
the service# of millions of men 
if we are compelled to employ 
them in fitting our battles. 

General Marshall’s report m- 



“. . . We are now concerned 
with the peace of the entire 
world, and the peace can only 
be maintained by the strong.” 
General Marshall said the tim- 
ing of a decision on universal 
military training is urgent be- 
cause State Department officials 
believe that a decision prior to 
the final peace negotiations 
"would greatly strengthen the 
hand of the United States In se- 
curing acceptance of a genuine 
organization to handle interna- 
tional differences.” 

‘The terms of the final peace 
settlement,” he continued, “will 
provide a basis for determining 
the strength of the regular or 
permanent postwar military 
forces of the United States, air, 
ground and naval, but they 
cannot. In my opinion, alter the 
necessity for a system of uni- 
versal military training. 

‘The yardstick by which the 
size of the permanent peace 
must be measured Is maximum 
security with minimum cost In 
men, materiel and maintenance.

Jap Invasion 
Move Bared 



WASHINGTON, Oct. 9— (INS) 
—Details of the American plans 
for the invasion of Japan— sched- 
uled to begin early in November 
in preparation for the main thrust 
into the Tokyo area in March, 
1946 were disclosed today by Gen- 
eral George C. Marshall in his 
victory report to the Secretary of 
War. 

The Japanese invasion was to 
have been carried out in two 
stages — “Operation Olympic” to 
seize the southernmost island of 
Kyushu, and "Operation Coronet” 
about four months later to estab- 
lish a beachhead on the Honshu 
coast east of Tokyo. 



Code Names 
Hid Strategic 
Plans of Allies 



WASHINGTON, Oct 9— UP)— 
Code names helped cloak the 
great strategic plans of the Allies 
in secrecy. * 

They came to light tonight in 
the biennial report of General 
George C. Marshall, woven into 
his accounting of the campaigns 
in Africa, Europe, Asia and the 
Pacific. 

One of them w'as "operation 
sledgehammer,” an attack that 
never came off, a plan for a di- 
versionary assault on the French 
coast in 1942 or early 1943. It was 
intended for use as a desperate

rection of General Douglas Mac

pronged assault on Kyushu by 
the Sixth U. S. Army, consisting 
of the First and 11th Army Corps 
and the Fifth Marine Amphibious 
Corps. 

13 DIVISIONS 



Ten Army divisions and three 
Marine Corps divisions were to 
be assigned for the Kyushu oper 
ation. 

The First Corps, 25th, 33rd and 
list Divisions, were to land at 
Miyazaki on Kyushu’s east coast.

tack. 

STRONGEST NAV 1 — 

General Arnold disclosed that 
the Army is now making a 45,- 
000 -pound bomb — twice as big as 
any ever used before, is blue- 
printing a 100 , 000 -pound bomb 
and airplanes to carry it, and 
has rockets which can guide 
themselves accurately to sources 
of heat, light and magnetism. 

“With the continued develop- 
ment of weapons and tech- 
niques now known to us, Ar- 
nold said, “the cities of New 
York, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Chi- 
cago and San Francisco may 
be subject to annihilation from 




homeland. Here .r. the plan. .. outlined in General George C. 
Marshall’, biennial report to the Secretory of War. The plan, were 
two- fold — designated by code name, of Olympic operation (.ched- 
uled for fall of 1945) and Coronet operation (.cheduled for 
spring of 1946). Olympic involved a three-pronged a..ault on 
.outhern Kyu.hu, with landing, at Miyazaki, Ariake Wan and near 
Kagoshima. Coronet called for an awault on Tokyo plain of eastern 
Hon.hu, tha aim being to de.troy tha Jap army on Hon.hu, occupy 
Tokyo-Yokohama area and then to fan out for a cleanup of tha 
remaining i.Iand. which .till remained in hand, of 



the enemy.

The second phase of the Japa- 
nese invasion, Operation Coronet, 
was to be carried out by the 
Eighth and 10th Armies, consist- 
ing of nine infantry divisions, two 
armored divisions and three Ma- 
rine divisions. They were to as- 
sault the Kanto or Tokyo plain 
of eastern Honshu. 

The Eighth and 10th Armies 
were to be followed ashore by the 
First Army, redeployed from Eu 
rope. In this attack the First 
Army would have contained 10 
infantry divisions. 

General Marshall said these 
three armies had the mission of 
destroying the Japanese army on 
the main home islands and to 
occupy the Tokyo-Yokohama 
area. Then they were to fan out 
to the north to clean up the rest 
of the islands as American land 
based air power in Japan in 
creased to 50 groups. 

Atomic bomb attacks on Hiro 
shima and Nagasaki, however, 
brought the war to an end with 
out putting the invasion plans 
into operation except as parts of 
them were used piecemeal in the 
occupation after the Japanese 
surrender. 



sure on the Russian front. 

And then there was “operation 
roundup,” the designation for the 
first plan, in 1943, for a cross- 
channel invasion of Europe. That 
eventually became "operation 
overlord” of 1944, with the land- 
ing in Normandy. 



General Tells 
Axis Blunders 



Universal Tr a in i n g 
Urged by Marshall 




WASHINGTON, Oct. 9.— (INS)— A system of universe 
military training as the cornerstone of a permanent Ameri- 
can security policy was urged today by General of the Army 
George C. Marshall. 

In a report to the Secretary of 




War, Marshall said the position 
of the United States would be 
sound if such a training program 
made it possible to mobilize 4,- 
900,000 within one year following 
am international crisis involving 
the United States. 

General Marshall said a period 
of one year's unbroken training 
appeared to be essential to the 
success of the system he recom- 
mended. He made no suggestion 
as to the age when the year’s 
training should start. 



NOT IN SERVICES- 



WASHINGTON, Oct. 9.— OP)— 
Hitler, Hirohito and Mussolini 
pulled many stupid blunders, but 
their worst, by far, was complete 
failure to frame a joint strategy. 

That mistake, while the Allies 
did just the opposite and pooled 
their resources in a common 
fight against the enemy, cost the 
Axis the war, General George C. 
Marshall said tonight. 

“Here were three criminal 
nations eager for loot and 
seeking greedily to advance 
their own self-interest by war, 
yet unable to agree on a stra- 
tegic over-all plan for accom- 
plishing a common objective,” 
the Army chief of staff said in 
his war report. 



“The Axis,” he added, "as a 



matter of fact, existed on pa- 
per only.” 



CODE NAMES- 



ITALY’S ACTION- 



Emphasizing that universal 
training did not mean universal 
military service, Marshall said 
trainees would not be inducted 
into the combatant forces, but 
would be in, separate organiza- 
tions maintained for training 
Durposes only. 

"Once trained,” he said, 
“young men would he freed 
from further connection with 
the Army unless they chose, as 
they now may, to enroll In the 
National Guard or an organized 
reserve unit, or to volunteer for 
service in the small profession- 
al army. 

"When the natLm is in jeop- 
ardy, they could be called, just 
as men are now called, by a 
committee of local neighbors, in 
an order of priority and under 
such conditions as directed at 
that time by the Congress.” 
General Marshall said that, in 
another national emergency, the 
existence of a substantial portion 
of the nation’s young manpower 
llready trained or in process of 
trafning, would make it possible 
o fill out immediately the peace- 
time ranks of the Navy, Regular 
Army, the National Guard and 
he Organized Reserve.

training.

nance. So far as they can fore- 
see world Conditions a decade 
from now, War Department

Army of 4,000,000 men within

Allies Given 
20 Billions Aid 



Washington, Oct. 9. — (INS) — 
General George C. Marshall said 
today that the United States 
furnished enough military lease- 
lend materiel to the Allied 
powers to equip 588 armored 
divisions, or 2000 infantry divi- 
sions. Total dollar value of the 
materiel was twenty billions. 

General Marshall said the Brit- 
ish Empire received enough 
American aircraft to equip four 
air forces the size of the U. S. 
Army Ninth Air Force. 

Shipments to Great Britain 
during the last two years of the 
war included 76,737 jeeps, 98,207 
trucks, 12,031 tanks and 1031 
pieces of heavy artillery. 

During the same period, Soviet 
Russia, in addition to thousands 
of tons of American raw ma- 
terials, received 28,356 jeeps, 
218,888 trucks, 4177 tanks, and 
252 pieces of heavy artillery. 



Another was failure of Ger- 
many and Japan to drive toward 
a junction in central Asia. 

“But to Japan,” Marshall 
said, “this objective was sec- 
ondary to looting the Far East 
while there was no real force 
to stop her. 

“Not only were the European 
partners of the Axis unable to 
coordinate their plans and re- 
sources and agree within their 
own nations how best to pro- 
ceed, but the eastern partner, 
Japan, was working in even 
greater discord.” 



OTHER WAYS- 



Here are some of the other 
ways Marshall said the foe 
helped the Allies win: 

1. Germany: Hitler’s insist- 

ence on placing his own judg- 
ment, based on his experience as 
an army corporal, ahead of the 
military counsel of his skilled 
generals. 

2. Italy: Mussolini’s puny at- 

tacks on Greece and Egypt, fore- 
ng Germany to over-extend her 
armies into the Balkan and Afri- 
can campaigns in attempts to 
save Benito. 

3. Japan: Failure to follow' up 
the Pearl Harbor attack with an 
invasion of Hawaii. Capture of 
Oahu and its important bases 
would have denied this nation 
its staging area from which to 
launch operations in the Western 
Pacific. 

Japan erred, too, in figuring 
the Pacific peoples she overran 
would welcome and work for the 
Mikado. Instead, the so-called 
Greater East Asia co-prosperity 
sphere Fizzled. 



1945 Cotton Crop 

SACRAMENTO, Oct. 9.— (INS) 
— California’s 1945 cotton crop 
was estimated by the State De 
partment of Agriculture today 
at 396,000 bales. 



General Accord 
Reached in China 



CHUNGKING, Oct 9.— (INS) 
— General Chang Chin- chung, 
minister of the Political Training 
Board of the National Military 
Council, announced today that a 
general agreement has been 
reached by Chinese Kuomintang 
and Communist leaders on po- 
litical questions. 

Chang, who participated in the 
discussions, said that a “satis- 
factory solutlon" , is expected. 



U. S. Deaths Exceed 5

that it demands complete 
frankness on my part,” Gen- 
eral Marshall declared. 

“Therefore I must say that 
many of the objections which 
Jiave been made to universal 
military training appear to be 
influenced by ulterior motives, 
or to ignore completely the 
tragedies of the past and pres- 
ent which we are seeking to 
avoid for the future. 

“They often seem to give un- 
due importance to restrictions 
on our freedom of life, trivial 
in comparison with the awful 
tragedies we are seeking to 
avoid and the great blessing 
we hope to secure for succeed- 
ing generations. 

“The timing of our decision 
on the question of universal 
military training is urgent. 
The officials of the State De- 
partment have been strongly 
of the opinion that a decision 
in this matter prior to the final 
peace negotiations would great- 
ly strengthen the hand of the 
United States In securing ac- 
ceptance of a genuine organi- 
zation to handle international 
differences. 

“The terms of the final peace 
settlement will provide a basis 
for determining the strength 
of the regular or permanent 
postwar military forces of the 
United States, air, ground, and 
naval, but they cannot, in my 
opinion, alter the necessity for 



sary to teach — ?n to act as 

“The training program,” h* 
said, would be according to the 
standards which have made the 
American soldier in this war 
the equal of the finest fightin; 
men. It would be kept abreast 
of technical developments and 
the resulting modifications ot 
tactics. 

“To those who fear the Arraj 
might militarize our younj 
men and indoctrinate then 
with dangerous conceptions, ti 
those who express doubts o! 
the Army’s capacity to do 
job, I submit the evidence 
cur present armies. The troop 
have been trained sufficient^ 
to defeat a first -class enemy 
Their minds have not be« 
warped — quite the contrary 
The American people are satis- 
fied, I am confident, that theii 
armies are, in fact, armies d 
democracy. 

“To those who consider tht 
introduction of a system d 
universal military training at 
Imposition on democracy, ! 
would reply that in my opinioi 
it would be the most den» 
cratic expression of our n» 
tional life.”

WASHINGTON, Oct. 9.— UP>- 
American Army deaths in battle 
in World War II are four times 
those of World War I. 

In fact, more Americans died 
than in five earlier wars com 
bined. These were the Revolu 
tion, War of 1812, Mexican War, 
Civil War (including both Union 
and Confederate deaths), and 
Spanish-American. 

In these five wars 192,581 
Americans lost their lives; the 
World War I figure* was 58,510; 
the World War H figure is 205,- 
000 plus. 

General George C. Marshall 
made the comparison tonight In 



his chief of staff’s report “so 



that there can be no misunder- 
standing of the enormous cost 
of this conflict, for which we 
were so completely unpre- 
pared.” 

“This w»r,” h# said, “ha# 



been the most costly of any In 
which the nation has been en- 
gaged.” 

He spoke of lives lost and 
physical miseries involved, rather 
than money. 

“There is no pay scale high 
enough to buy the services of a 
single soldier during even a few' 
minutes of the agony of com- 
bat,” he said. 

Yet the great toll of American 
lives is far less than the toll of j 
the enemy. About eight Ger- 
mans, Italians and Japanese died 
for every American killed in bat- 
tle, Marshall said, adding there 
were 1,592,600 enemy battle dead. 

Hi^ figures dealt with the 
Army alone. Combined Army 
and Navy deaths are about 260,- 
000. And combined American 
casualties, Including dead, 
wounded, missing and prisoners, 
exceed 1,070,000,

The raid on Clark Field was over in 14 
minutes, except for a little peppering by 
light Jap planes. I got to the field as the 
last of the large bombers was drumming 
away. The place was a shambles, twisted

black into the sky. More than half of the 
new B-17s, which had just flown in, were 
scattered about the place in thousands of 
pieces. All the machine shops and hangars 
were down, and most of the officers’ quar- 
ters and barracks. 

Japs Lose 2 Planes 

I did what I could to organize the re- 
ntoval of the 193 dead and wounded. W e 
AXm ^‘ had only three or four ambulances at Stot- 
senburg, but we used trucks for the over- 
flow and got the wounded over to our hos- 
I pital. Ninety-three of the casualties were 
y / killed at Clark. Seven more died that night 
\ f in our hospital. 

ft Most of our planes were caught on the 

ground. Our fighters, such as they were, 
were not at Clark that day. They were 
based at a new field at Iba, on the coast of 
Zambales Province, about 40 miles north 
of Olongapo. They were hit just as sud- 
denly, just as hard and simultaneously with 
the bombers at Clark. The fighters had 
Kfc been up earlier that day but had landed for 
Bir fuel and lunch. 

* The Japs lost only two planes during 

the raid on Clark. These were shot down by 
the 200th Coast Guard Artillery’s, anti-air- 
craft batteries stationed in the cantonment 
at the edge of the airfield. 

As for enemy paratroops , the only 
chutists my Filipino troops captured that 
day were a half a dozen American bo$>s

Cry 'Down With Emperor' 

TOKYO ; Oct. 10.— (INS)— Newly liberated Jap-

downtown Tokyo today and boldly demanded the overthrow

Several hundred red flag-wav-

the main street and along the

they shouted:

Riot Act Read to Film 
Pickets in Mass Arrest 



Involved and the possibility 
that the demonstration will 
not affect us. They could* dem* 
onstrate and still get to work 
here on time. We have no part 
in the strike dispute; our only 
Interest Is in maintaining our 
production/' 

McNett predicted that "be- 
tween 5000 and 10,000 Lockheed 
men will show up." He added 
that many Lockheed men have 
already taken place in the picket 
line, and claimed some had "been 
beaten up." Studio Strike Leader 
Sorrell said 20,000 "might turn 
out." 

Among the 252 men and 74 
women arrested as pickets were 
Matthew Huxley, 24, a studio 
story analyst and son of Novelist 
Aldous Huxley, and Earl Robin- 
son, composer of "Ballads for 
America” and "The House Where 
I Live." 



OTHERS ARRESTED— 



Also arrested was Lavonne 
Moore, personal secretary to 
Sorrell. Included, too, were such 
well known film publicists as 
Charles Daggett, George Glass, 
Alice Stuart, Irving Rubine, Bill 
Bloecher, Jack Cooper and his 
wife, Miss Jane Tracy, and Len 
Simpson, editor of The Atom, a 
strikers’ publication. 

The arrests were peaceful. As 
Sheriffs deputies and other uni 
formed forces moved in for the 
roundup at 6 a. m. yesterday 
Sorrell broadcast an order to his 
pickets not to resist. 

"Let the police In,” he 
bawled. "Don’t resist. Don’t hit 
anybody. There’ll be no group 
rioting today. You’ll be bailed 
out — and tomorrow, there’ll be 
20,000 men on this picket line.” 



GROUP BY GROUP — 



The pickets, laughing and sing- 
ing, held hands up in mock sur- 
render— and were arrested group 
after group. 

The day’s strike developments 
also Included these significant 
factors: 

1. In Washington, the National 
Labor Relations Board ordered 
all but seven of the ballots cast 
last May in the set decorators 
collective bargaining election be 
counted. This means that 105 bal- 
lots will be tallied — 54 cast by 
•trikers. 51 by men hired to re- 
place them. The count will be 
made here, probably this after- 
noon — and MAY settle the strike 
by determining the bargaining 
agent for the 77 decorators and 
carpenters over which both the 
A. F. L. Painters Union and the 
A. F. L. International Associa- 
tion of Theatrical Stage Em- 
ployees want jurisdiction. 

(This is tha jurisdictional dis- 
pute which originally precipitated 
the strike last March 12, eventually 
bringing thousands of workers in 
ether studio crafts into the juris- 
dictional fight.) 



STRATEGY MEET - 



2. In Burbank Sheriff Biscailuz 
and l)is aides met with peace of- 
ficials of Burbank, Glendale, 
Pasadena and Los Angeles in a 
strategy huddle to decide their 
course of action this morning 
when the thousands of Lockheed 
workers join the picket line. 

S. In the county jail, charged 
with assault with a deadly weap- 
on, was Roy Van Bush, 52, studio 
electrician, of 909 North Florence 
street, Los Angeles. He is ac- 
cused of being the picket who 
on Tuesday seriously beat Mack- 
lin "Porky” Hall, former Hal 
Roach "fat boy” comedian. Hall, 
originally reported near death at 
Burbank Hogpital, yesterday was 
reported Improved but still in 
serious condition. 

4. State Guard officials denied 
reports that they had been or- 
dered to intervene in the strike, 
but said that in line with rou- 
tine. they had "made a survey” 
of the strike situation. 

5. Inside Warner Brothers’ 
picket- bound studio between 500 
>nd 600 workers continued to 
perform their duties. Many of 
these are remaining at the studio 
overnight, being bedded and fed 
by the studio prop and com- 

departments. No pic 



men have not reported for work. 
Studio officials reported that 
many employees who wanted to 
come to work had telephoned that 
they had received phone calls at 
their homes warning them not to 
dare to show up. 



STEEL HELMETS- 



Yesterday’s strike develop 
ments began before dawn — as 
early as 2:30 a. m., in fact, when 
the first pickets began to arrive. 
By 5:30 there were between 250 
and 300 men and women in the 
line. 

At that hour, a row of buses 
full of 200 sheriff’s deputies, 
steel-helmeted, arrived and de- 
barked their loads a block from 
the studio gate. Three sub- 
machine guns were in the arma- 
ment. They wore sidearms, 
carried nightsticks and billies. 
Several boxes of tear-gas can- 
nisters were opened. 

The pickets, shuffling around 
their treadmill -line outside the 
studio gate, broke out into "God 
Bless America." Many of. them 
wore' steel helmets, too. 

At 5:45 the deputies, aug 
mented by Los Angeles police 
and plainclothesmen, formed 
squads of 24 men, and stretched 
two semi-circular lines at each 
side of the picket line. 

From the strikers’ loudspeaker 
truck, blared the voice of Sor- 
rell: 

"A few goons,” he shouted, 
"will enter your lines. They 
are getting $50 a day. You 
will be arrested. Do not re- 
sist; *do not strike police. I 
am doing this to preserve law 
and save violence. You will be 
balled out, and tomorrow we'll 
have 20,000 men on the picket 
line.”

RIOT ACT - 



At 5:47 Burbank Police Chief 
Elmer Adams spoke over an- 
other loudspeaker. Thrice he 
read the riot act. Thrice dra- 
matically, he said: 

“I declare this an unlawful 
assembly. I hereby command 
you In the name of the people 
of California to disperse.” 

His only reply was the con- 
tinued shuffling of pickets’ feet 
—plus a spattering of jeers. 

Then a police whistle shrilled 
three times. With the precision 
of a military maneuver, the two 
half -circles of deputies closed In, 
and as though they had been 
caught in a purse-net, the hun- 
dreds of pickets were sur- 
rounded. 

There was no fighting, no 
violence, no disorder. Methodi- 
cally, the deputies broke up the 
pickets into small groups, began 
herding them into the Warner 
Studio lot. There, the men were 
ordered into one sound stage, the 
women into another.

The arrested women were held 



in a second-floor room 



three weeks of hearings were 
held and thousands of pages of 
testimony taken. Meantime, other 
studio unions had joined the 



at the 'walkout in a sympathy strike 



STAY USSIDE- 



Then, in buses and vans and 
black marias, the arrested 
pickets were taken to Burbank 
police station, and booking began. 
In mid-afternoon, the booking 
was still going on— man after 
man and woman after woman, on 
charges of rioting, disturbing 
the peace, and disobeying a 
court injunction against picket- 
ing. 

At first, Police Judge Raymond 
L. Reed set $500 bail for each 
person brought before him. After 
some 15 pickets had made bail, 
union attorneys carried to the 
judge a protest against the crowd- 
ing and sanitary and feeding con- 
ditions where the prisoners were 
being held. Judge Reed looked 
the scene over, agreed the ar- 
restees were crowded and from 
then on released each person on 
his own recognizance as he was 
brought up. 

He set arraignment for all for 
October 22, at 10 a. m. 

Back at the studio, the picket 
line at the main gate was, by- 
now, reduced to the total of four 
pickets allowed . by the court in- 
junction. 

From inside the studio, loud- 
speakers blared invitations to 
"Warner Brothers employees to 
come freely in to work." Studio 
spokesmen said that the main 
body of workers had already ar 



City Hall. They were gay, pow- 
dering noses and applying lip 
stick, and wisecracking merrily. 

Following the mass arrests, 
Sheriff Biscailuz received the fol 
lowing telegram from Roy M. 
Brewer, international representa 
tive for the I. A. T. S. E.: 

"In behulf of the 14,000 mem- 
bers of the I. A. T. S. E. em- 
ployed In the motion picture 
studios who are merely asking 
the right to work without in- 
timidation and coercion, I wont 
to thank you for your action in 
restoring a lawful situation at 
the Warner Brothers Studio. As 
loyal members of the Ameri- 
can Federation of Labor we 
have long fought for labor’s 
rights, but we well know that 
neither labor nor anyone else 
has any rights in a state of 
anarchy. You have done your 
duty as Sheriff of Los Angeles 
County in a way that our 
American tradition demands. 
The real American trade un- 
ions will commend you for it. 
We are depending upon you to 
see to it that a lawful situation 
continues to prevail.”

SHERIFF’S THREAT— 

Of the announcement that 
thousands of Lockheed men will 
be on the picket line by morning, 
Biscailuz said: 

"If they show up and refuse 
to obey the dispersal order 
which will be read to them, 
they will be subject to arrest 
the same as the pickets we 
arrested Wednesday morning. 
It will make no difference to 
me or my deputies how many 
of them there are, or to what 
organization they belong." 

The next most important de- 
velopment of the strike day came 
in Washington, with the NLRB’s 
action ordering counting of the 
bargaining ballets. 

The ballots are those cast in 
the election last May, ordered by 
the NLRB to determine which 
union should be bargaining agent 
for the film decorators. The elec 
tion followed a walkout on March 
12, of 77 film decorators. 

Those 77, employed in all stu- 
dio?, had originally been an inde- 
pendent guild. They voted to 
join the Painters Union, A. F. L. 
After the vote, the I. A. T. S. E. 
claimed jurisdiction. Both sides 
threatened to strike ’if the pro 
ducers dealt in negotiations with 
the other. The producers, "in the 
middle," refused to- negotiate 
with either group until the 
NLRB decided which union had 
jurisdiction. 

WALKOVT STARTS— 

The Painters Union men then 
walked out. The producers hired 
replacements from the I. A. T. 
S. E. Then came the NLRB elec- 
tion order. Both groups voted. 
Each group later protested the 
ballots cast by the other group. 
The NLRB gave no decision. In

and the studios were picketed. 

Finally, yesterday, the NLRB 
announced that it had voted two 
to one to count ballots of both 
groups. Only ballots not to be 
counted totaled seven, cast by 
men who were ineligible to vote, 
as agreed by both sides to the 
controversy. This leaves 105 
votes to be counted. Because of 
this division, the strikers yester 
day hailed the NLRB decision as 
a victory, on the basis that the 
slight majority of Painters Union 
men will give that union the elec 
tion, make it the bargaining 
agent for the set decorators. 

Producers yesterday reiterated 
that they will abide by the final 
NLRB decision. But observers 
pointed out that even if the 
NLRB certifies the Painters 
Union, it will not necessarily end 
the strike, as negotiations with 
producers are still pending, and 
the strike may be continued until 
the outcome of such negotiations. 

WILL OBEY 



In Los Angeles Stewart Meach 
am, head of the NLRB office 
here, said that airmail instruc- 
tions were on the way from 
Washington ordering the ballot 
count. 

"If we get the letter by 2 
o’clock Thursday afternoon,” he 
said, "the ballots will be taken 
at once from the bank vault 
where they are impounded and 
will be counted Immediately.” 
From Washington came the 
word that Gerard R. Reilly was 
the dissenting NLRB member. 
He voted that only the ballots of 
the 51 I. A. T. S. E. replacements 
be counted and not the ballots of 
the original discharged painters’ 
union members. He was outvoted, 
however. 

For the I. A. T. S. E„ spokes 
man Brewer yesterday com 
minted thus on the NLRB deci 
sion: 

"I have just been Informed 
of the decision of the NLRB 
which ruled both the replace- 
ments’ and strikers’ votes 
should be counted — with Mr. 
Reilly dissenting and contend- 
ing that only the replacements’ 
votes should be counted. 

"We feel that under the cir- 
cumstances Involved In this 
case, that Mr. Rcllly’a decision 
was most appropriate. How- 
ever, we also feel that if Mr. 
Herzog and Mr. Hustln (the 
other NLRB nieihbers), in

in this case — even though justi- 
fied — would establish a prece- 
dent detrimental to labor, then 
we are glnd that they ruled as 
they did. 

"Los Angeles today knows 
what we have said all along — 
that the Set Decorators’ case 
was never the real reson for the 
strike, but only the excuse. 

"We still do not know what 
effect the NLRB decision will 
have on the strike, but we 
accept it and we will carry it 
out to the best of our ability.” 
Yesterday, also, rumors that 
the State Guard would take a 
hand in the strike situation were 
denied by Colonel Laurence 
Mickel, Southern California com 
mandant. He said: 

“California 1 a *£ prescribes 
that units of the guard may 
only be called into action when 
the situation has gotten out of 
hand of the local law enforce- 
ment agencies, such as the 
police and Sheriff’s office, and

maintaining law and order.

Clark and rounded them up at some risk 
to the flyers. 

I rode back to Stotsenburg about 
o’clock/ that afternoon for lunch and found 
an American girl — a Mrs. Xecker, wife of 
the manager of the Radio Corporation of 
^America station at Manila — sitting on my 
front porch. She had been up to Baguio 
with friends over the week end and had 
driven down to Stotsenburg before the 
Baguio raid. Her husband was supposed to 
meet her at Stotsenburg, but the Japs bad 
knocked down one of the railroad bridges 
on the line leading up from Manila. 

She was stuck, one of the first of so 
many defenseless American women caught 
in the machinery of war. Tom Doolev 

%f 

quickly found that there would be no train 
to Manila until the bridge was repaired. So 
X fixed up a room for Mrs. Neeker and got 
through a call to her husband. 

Message to Wife 

Mr. Xecker seemed very grateful and 
asked me what he could do to repay me. 

“Send a message to my wife and tell 
her I’m okay,” I asked him. 

He did this, and sent other such mes- 
sages, one of the last of which was a Christ- 
mas wire to Mrs. Wainwriglit just before 
the R. C. A. station closed down. 

I HAD THOUGHT OF ADELE A 
LOT THAT FIRST DAY OF THE WAR; 
HAD THANKED GOD THAT SHE WAS 
OUT OF IT. BUT I MISSED HER BAD- 
LY. THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS 
TO SAY THAT CANNOT BE SAID TO 
ANYONE BUT A WIFE. 

* Tom Dooley drove Mrs. Neeker to Ma- 
nila the next morning, and on the same day 
the undamaged and patched-up bombers at 
Clark Field took off and went south — along 
with the unscathed bombers at Nichols 
Field. What was left of the fighters stayed 
on Luzon to be whittled dqwn in time to two 
planes. Throughout the whole coming cam- 
paign our fighters were used mainly for re- 
connaissance. There weren’t enough of 
them to fight the enemy. 

The rest of December 0 was spent in 
telephoning MacArthur’s headquarters and 
working at the job of getting ail the per- 
sonnel of my command at Stotsenburg un- 
der as much cover as was available. The 
26th Cavalry was moved from its barracks 
and stables and camped in a near-by woods. 
The horses of the pack battery also were led 
to similar shelter. The men of the pack bat- 
tery stayed at their gun positions in front 
of headquarters. 

Transportation Crisis 

AND THAT DAY I STARTED TO 
GET SOME TRANSPORTATION FOR 
THE NORTH LUZON FORCE. IT WAS 
TRANSPORTATION OF A LAUGH- 
ABLE KIND, THOUGH NOT AT THE 
TIME. I HIRED A NUMBER OF ORDI- 
NARY PASSENGER BUSES FROM 
TWO COMMERCIAL FIRMS WHICH 
EVENTUALLY HELPED US IN THE 
LONG AND HEARTBREAKING WITH- 
DRAWAL INTO BATAAN. 

I RENTED AND BOUGHT SMALL- 
ER CARS, TOO, FOR STAFF WORK, 
ADMINISTRATION A N D . COURIERS. 
WHEN DILIGENT EFFORTS FAILED 




X FS* 1 B-17i lined up on Clark Field 
were perfect targets for Japanese pilots and when 

TO UNEARTH ADDITIONAL CARS TO 
RENT OR BUY, I SENT SENIOR OFFI- 
CERS OUT ON THE ROADS AND WE 
GOT THOSE CARS BY STOPPING 
THEM AND REQUISITIONING THEM 
ON THE SPOT. I WAS SORRY ABOUT 
THAT, BUT OUR MAIN CHANCE OF 
SURVIVAL DEPENDED ON OUR MO- 
BILITY THAT I SENSED ON TOP OF 
SENSING THAT MACARTHUR WOULD 
BE ABLE TO SEND ME FEW OF THE 
SUPPLIES REQUESTED IN THE LIST 
WHICH JOHNNY PUGH, MY AIDE, 
HAD CARRIED TO MANILA. 

On December 0 MacArtkur’s chief sig- 
nal officer, Brigadier General Aiken, came 
to Stotseiibttrg to inquire wliat I needed in 
the way of communication equipment. My 
own signal officer, Josh Stausell, semi- 
explosively pulled out of his pocket a car- 
bon copy of an unanswered requisition he 
had sent in to Mac Arthur's headquarters 
some time before. 

General Aiken looked through it and 
shook his head. He handed it back. 

“We can’t do very much for you,” he 
said. “You’ll have to improvise.” 

SO AS OF DECEMBER 9 WE HAD 
ONLY THE PUBLIC TELEPHONE AND 
TELEGRAPH SYSTEM FOR OUR COM- 
MUNICATIONS, AND OUR BOR- 
ROWED AND APPROPRIATED 
TRANSPORT SYSTEM RANGED FROM 
LOPSIDED BUSES TO SPORTS CON- 
VERTIBLES. WE HAD NO NAVY AND 
NO AIR FORCE BEYOND THE RECON- 
NAISSANCE P-40’S. ALL FIVE OF MY 
DIVISIONS WERE STILL MOBILIZ- 
ING. THE 26TH CAVALRY, MY PACK 
BATTERY AND PHILIPPINE SCOUTS 
OUTFITS WERE THE ONLY EFFI- 
CIENT COMBAT UNITS WE HAD. 

I drove up to Lingayen Gulf the next 
day, the 10th, to inspect the beach defenses 
of the Eleventh and Twenty, -First Divi-

President at TVA Dam Ceremony 
Warns on Reconversion Task 



WASHINGTON, Oct. 10.— 
(INS) — President Truman re- 
turned tonight to the White 
House following his dedication 
this afternoon of the newest dam 
In the Tennessee Valley Authori- 
ty system at Gilbertsville, Ky, 
There he had sounded a warning 
that a “few selfish men will not 
be permitted to hinder success 
of the nation’s reconversion from 
war to peace.” 

Departing from the prepared 
text of his dedicatory address, 
Mr. Truman asserted: 

“We still have a few selfish 
men who think more of their 
personal Interests than they do 
of the nation’s welfare, but 
they are not going to prevail.” 

'LITTLE TROUBLES’— 

The President had prefaced 



Disabled American Veterans. Of 
the major changes: 

1. Eliminates a $2500 limit in 
purchases by veterans. New 
maximums will be established by 
the Smaller War Plants Corpo- 
ration. 

2. Allows a veteran entering 
retail business to buy an initial 
stock of goods. 

3. Permits a veteran to deal 
directly with disposal agencies 
after certification by the SWPC 
at the lowest price at which prop- 
erty is sold. 

4. Permits a veteran to buy- 
automotive or other equipment 
required by his employment. 

5. Provides 



for extension of 
credit under terms set by the dis- 
posal agency. 



Ask 550 Million 



WASHINGTON, Oct. 10. — UP) 
— Representative Herter (Repub- 
lican), Massachusetts'; said today 
Congress should provide UNRRA 
with another $550,000,000 to save 
millions in Europe from “starva- 
tion and death.”

He said Sullivan boasted of making advances to Mrs. Lynd, left.

FASHION-MINDED 



Home again ffrom a Pacific tion in which Lynd found him 
war cruise, John J. Lynd, 30, 

230-pound Merchant Marine of- 
ficer, went to court yesterday for 
the final settlement of some 
“personal business,” which had 
begun at the end of a previous 
cruise last April. 

When he came ashore on that 
occasion, Lynd met Benjamin 
Sullivan, 30, a discharged war 
veteran, who, he says, openly- 
boasted of making advances to 
the officer’s young wife, Mrs. 



TVA dam, situated 22 miles 
above Paducah, Kentucky, on the 
Tennessee River. The dam 
marked the last major construc- 
tion project on the river under 
the TVA. 

The President described the 
TVA as an “Important experi- 
ment In democracy” and called 
for early developments of other 
great watersheds of the nation 
to provide “jobs and better 
living.” 

“We must continue all over 
the United States to wage war 
against flood and drought,” 
the President said. “Our vast 
store of natural resources can 
be made to serve us in peace 
with the same efficiency they 
did In war. The valleys of 
America await their full de- 
velopment.”

sions. A number of Jap planes shot over us 
on the way, going south as we went north. 
But we were not molested. It seemed like a 
good omen at the time, hut when 1 got back 
to Stotensburg that night, I knew where 
the bombers I saw earlier in the dav had 
gone. MY POST WAS HALF-WRECKED. 

Worse , the bombers had sighted that 
part of the 26 th Cavalry assigned' to 
guard against paratroop landings and 
had wiped out a distressing number of 
men and horses , including some of my 
only seasoned men. 

All of them and their mounts would 
have been smashed if Colonel (later Brig- 
adier General) Clinton A. Pierce, a great 
little fighter from Brooklyn, had not seen 
to it that part of the 26th stayed in the 
woods. 

It is hard to see a man die. But for a 
cavalryman it is almost equally hard to see 
a gallant horse die. The 26th lived to see 
them all die, one by one. 

The Japs invaded the Philippines on 
December 12, 1941. They struck and landed 
at little Aparri, on the northern tip of 
Luzon, and on the far southeastern coast of 
the Bicol Peninsula at Legaspi. I was back 
at Lingaven Gulf that day, and when 1 got 
my report from Aparri, which was t lie land- 
ing which concerned the North Luzon force, 
I decided to let them land. 

They were feinting at Aparri. They 
had hit it with a reinforced brigade of about 
8000 men, attempting to pull some of my 
forces up to that point and weaken the 
already weak defense in the Lingaven Gulf 
region. 



Besides, I knew that *the only way 
south from Aparri was down the Cayagan 
Valley. I had a battalion in the Belete Pass 
at the base of the valley, and dug in well 
enough to stop a fairly considerable force 
moving down that way. So I made no de- 
ployment of my main body of troops, so cer- 
tain was I that when the Japs made their 
serious landings they would make them in 
the areas where I had the chief weight of 
my troops. 

Rat in the H ouse 

But the rat was in the house, and it was 
no comfort. I drove back to half-wrecked 
Stotscnburg that night of December 12 to 
find that it had been rebombed during the 
day. It was irritating as the devil to have 
my headquarters anchored at Stotsenburg 
instead of farther north. But I was tied 
down by my 31st Division, which was over 
on the Zambales coast. There was still a 
chance that the Japs would strike there, so 
I couldn't get too far away from it. 

But on the 13th of December I did com- 
promise by moving my headquarters to the 
village of Bamban, about ten miles north-

running near it, and I knew that in the near 
future 1 would be depending more on mes- 
sengers and couriers than on the fragile 
public phone system. 



The Japs hit our undertrained , under - 
manned and pathetically equipped 
forces, who had only their hearts— and 
the leadership of Wainwright — to lead 
them .

Hospital Called Good Place to 
Banish Greed, Selfishness

PROTECTION 



OCEANSIDE, Oct. 10.— A hos- 
pital ward is a hedgerow of mis- 
ery, pain and discouragement. 
But it's also a place of miracu- 
lous healing. 

Sickness and injury are not the 
only afflictions that can be healed 
there. I can heartily recommend 
those white cots for the healing 
of another and worse malady- 
human greed and selfishness. 

If you know someone who 
fieeds a lesson or two in humility 
eend him around to Ward ^5-A at 
the Santa Margarita Naval Hos 
pltal here. Let him meet Lieuten 
ant Jerry B. Anderson of the 
Navy’s Night Fighter Squadron 
534. I’m sure one gander at 
Jerry’s smile would open his 
heart to a new and lovelier world 
Would teach him that piling up 
dollars isn’t the only thing in life 
that counts. 

For Lieutenant Anderson’s 
smile is not an empty one. It’s a 
smile of great spunk; of grim 
determination; of the human 
spirit fiercely aglow instead of 
being dimmed out. 



aided makes life go on for Jerry. 

You see, there was a time when 
he hardly dreamed such a luxu- 
rious pastime was within his 
reach. That was just after he 
was injured in the South Pacific. 
It happened only a few days be- 



BEST CUSTOMER - 



Jerry smiles because he’s the 
hospital librarian’s best customer. 
What’s so hot about that? Well, 
those who have been fortunate 
enough to escape never-ending 
monotony may not understand. 
But being able to read books un- 




Following a meeting with Sher- 
iff Eugene Biscailuz, at which 
they asked adequate protection 
against strike violence, a group 
of motion picture producers yes- 
terday issued a statement outlin- 
ing their position. They said: 
“Obviously the violence that 
has occurred Is not of the pro- 
ducers’ making. The last thing 
the employers want is violence. 
The situation Is this: most of 
the studio employees want to 
come to work. Some do not. 
Naturally the studios welcome 
those loyal workers who do 
wont to stay on the job and 
who want to keep their rela- 
tions with the employers and 
with their fellow workers with- 
in the hounds of law and rea- 
son.

VET IS INVENTOR 

During his introduction to hos 
pital life at Pearl Harbor, Lieu 
tenant Anderson was content to 
let a Red Cross worker read to 
him. 

But as soon as he hit the States 
— Seattle was the first stop) — he 
made up his mind to invent some 
self-reading gadget. With the 
help of his parents, the Theodore 
Andersons of Winlock, Wash., a 
book table was built. 

This fits over the bed and is 
equipped with a stand reaching 
just over chest level. To turn the 
pages a willow stick was whittlec 
according to Jtrry’s specifica 
lions. It is shaped like the letter 
L and is broad at one end so it 
can be held in the teeth. Attache* 
to the other end of it is a lead 
Z pencil rubber tip. This grips and 
tutms the pages of a book rapidly 
and easily as Jerry guides the 
stick with his mouth. 

He proudly showed me how 
it works. It was a humbling ex- 
jperience indeed to see how ap- 
preciative he was of his crude 
: invention. Those of us who take 
[our good health for granted 
should have seen his eyes sparkle 
with elation. 

And don't think this won’t be 
a white Christmas for the coura- 
geous Navy lad. With a broad 
grin he told me: • 

“Last Christinas I remember 
eating one small piece of tur- 
key about as big as a quarter 
and one teaspoonful of cran- 
berry sauce. This year I'll do 
much better for myself.” 



“But those employees have 
been set upon when they tried 
to go to work. Violence has 
been used to keep them from 
their jobs. While such action 
continues, the producers will 
use every legal means to pro- 
tect their employees, their 
property and the right of a 
major industry to maintain Its 
business. Violence against our 
employees cannot continue. 

“The producers cannot un- 
derstand a situation In which 
the two, quarreling factions of 
labor in the industry become 
embroiled in rioting at the 
exact moment when the Inter- 
national presidents of the 
unions Involved have ordered 
them to get together and Iron 
out their difficulties between 
themselves. Committees repre- 
senting the varipus unions were 
appointed and Instructed to 
meet and to make every effort 
to bring about a settlement. 
They were given a five-day 
deadline. The producers and the 
workers who had stayed on 
their Jobs were hopeful that a 
peaceful end was near to the 
wasteful jurisdictional strike 
precipitated seven months ago.

CITES RIOTS - 



“However, instead of seeking 
a peuceful settlement, the 
strikers massed 1000 pickets in 
front* of Wurner Brothers’ Stu- 
dio early last Friday. They 
overturned In the street the 
automobiles of workers who 
attempted to drive In to their 
jobs. They assaulted workmen, 
union ir.cn who like the rioters 
themselves belong to the Amer- 
ican Federation of Labor. The 
assaults und rioting huve con- 
tinued each working day since 
last Friday. 

“Apparently a fundamental 
question has been raised as to 
whether the labor relations of 
a great Industry are to be con- 
trolled by the group which can 
get the biggest line of men in 
front of the employers’ gate, or 
whether they are to be based 
on the fair rights of both work- 
er and employer. 

“Whatever the claims of the 
strikers may be, they cannot as 
Americans claim the right to 
flout the law and the rights of 
other human beings. 

“The strikers are flouting the 
law. The studios do not intend 
to submit to a continuance of 
such action.”

as negotiations between shipyard 
owners and union members 
reached a deadlock. 

Meanwhile in the lumber in 
dustry walkout, five additional 
yards were picketed today, rais- 
ing the total number to 12. More 
than 300 workers stayed away 
from their jobs. 

I The shipyard strike was called 
I by the A. F. L. Boatbuilders’ 
! Union after a breakdown in nego- 
tiations over a wage increase. The 
j yards affected are Campbell Ma- 



chine Company. Lynch Shipbuild 
ing Company, San Diego Marine 
Construction Company, Asso- 
ciated Repair Basin and National 
Iron Works. 

The union seeks a wage in- 
crease for journeymen from $1.20 
to $1.40 an hour, while the yards 
have offered $1.34. 

Union leaders and lumber yard 
officials are scheduled to meet 
next Monday In a renewed effort 
to reach a settlement of the 
strike, which also was called over 
a wage dispute.

Talks seeking to end the. 
spreading soft coal strike were 
extended another day after a fu- 
tile session last night between; 
operators and Union Chief John 
L. Lewis. 

Secretary of Labor Schwellen- 
bach said that this four-day 
i conference will continue today. 

Lewis had offered to call off 
the strikes involving 187,000 
workers if the operators would 
agree to negotiate on the ques- 
tion of unionization of the su- 
pervisory employees. The oper- 
ators sought to impose condi- 
tions to their acceptance which 
they said would protect their 
present opposition to bringing 
the foremen into the Lewis union. 

They contend that foremen 
and other supervisory employ- 
ees are a part of management. 

The coal walkout, involving 
nearly half the country’s soft 
coal production, is the biggest 
of scores of labor disputes keep- 
ing 451,000 workers off the job. 

Here are other highlights of, 
the national labor situation:

8 Pairs Ladies' 
Hosiery Apiece in 
'46-Mainly Nylon 



NEW YORK, Oct. 10.— UP)— 
American girls and women can 
count on slightly less than eight 
pairs of full-fashioned hosiery 
apiece next year — but most of 
those will be nylon. 

Earl Constantine, president of 
the National Association of Hosi- 
ery Manufacturers, said maxi- 
mum anticipated nylon produc- 
tion of 29,000,000 dozen pairs 
probably would comprise 80 per 
cent of full fashioned production. 
An additional 7,000,000 dozen of 
such fibers as silk and rayon 
would bring the total to 36,000,- 
000 dozen pairs for nearly 60,000,- 
000 customers. 



leaders on October 19, at the Los 
Angeles Central Labor Council, 
it was announced yesterday. 

W. J. Bassett, secretary -treas- 
urer of the A. F. L. Los Angeles 
Central Labor Council, said the 
meeting was called at behest of 
the Metal Trades Council “as a 
result of growing indignation in 
A. F. L. ranks over irresponsible 
and unauthorized procedure by 
individual groups in connection 
with work stoppages.” 

Underlying the move, accord- 
ing to observers and comment in 
A. F. of L. rank and file circles, 
is a desire to “get the Commu- 
nists out of A. F. of L. activities, 
into which they have infiltrated 
themselves.” 

Calling of the meeting resulted 
directly from a resolution 
adopted 218 to 8 by the Building 
Trades Council at its last ses- 
sion, and which demanded “con- 
structive action” be taken to end 
“irregular procedure” in the con- 
duct of strikes. 

Establishment of a standard 
policy of procedure, whereby the 
entire A. F. of L. will take one 
uniform stand, is the principal 
objective of the October 19 con- 
ference, Basset^ stated.

'This Is My Story* 

By Gen. Jonathan M. Wainw rigliit 

(Copyright, 1945, King Features Syndicate, Inc. Repro- 
duction in whole or in part strictly prohibited.) 

Tliat was the day the Japs truly hit us. 
j They struck the beaches at Vigan, up from 
i Lingayen Gulf, with a task force of war- 
jjl ships and then unloaded 84 jammed trans- 

! s ' ports. 

That was the (lay I realized, for all 
time, the futility of trying to fight a war 
$ without an air force. What targets those 
84 transports would have made! But the 
only plane over them during the landing 
L / was a P-40 reconnaisance ship. The Navy’s 
I J handful of motor torpedo boats were far 
#V south. 

\ My orders from Mac Arthur were 
simple and to the point: 

“IN THE EVENT OF A LAND- 
ING, ATTACK AND DESTROY THE 
LANDING FORCE.” 

But it was not possible to attack, even 
if trained troops had been available. There 
was no room to deploy any considerable 
force between the mountains and the 
beaches in the landing area. I intensified 
the patrol activities around the landings, to 
delay their advance as much as possible, 
while I maneuvered my divisions into posi- 
tions from which a counterattack could be 
wlth0 launched. 

The shooting war opened on the 16th 
of December, and looking back on it makes 
me think that it was touchingly symbolic of 
all other combats in the futile fight for the 
Philippines. Two busloads of Jap troops 
moving south from Vigan were ambushed 
by a platoon of Filipino infantrymen eom-

from the Federal tax roll Jan- 
uary 1 and slashing Govern- 
ment revenues an estimated 
five billion, 350 million dollars 
in 1946. The vote was 343 
to 10. 

Passage of the bill came after 
demands were made by Repub- 
licans and Democrats for re 
trenchment in Government ex 
penditures. 

The bill now goes to the Sen- 
ate. Chairman George (Demo 
crat), Georgia, of the Senate fi 
lance committee, has announced 
that the committee will start 
work on it Monday. The con- 
gressional time table calls for 
final enactment of the measure 
before November 1. 

BILL AS PASSED- 

As passed by the House, the 
bill contains the following major 
provisions; 

1. Removes from the income 
tax roll the 12 million persons — 
mostly low -Income married Indi- 
viduals or persons with depend- 
ents — who are now paying only 
the 3 per cent normal tax. 

2. Reduces substantially the 
income taxes of the remainder of 

he 36 million taxpayers by slic- 
ng four percentage points from 
the surtax rates in each bracket, 
effective January 1. 

3. Gives upper bracket taxpay 
ers — those earning more than 
?,20,000 to $22,000 a year — a 
straight income tax cut of 10 pei 
cent and reduces the maximum 
lax rate on tax bracket incomes 
from 90 to 81 per cent. 

EXCESS PROFITS 

4. Reduces the excess profits 
lax on corporations from a net 
85.5 per cent to 60 per cent, and 
the normal tax on larger corpora- 
tions from 40 to 36 per cent, ef- 
fective January 1, 1946. 

5. Repeals the excess profits 
tax entirely on January 1, 1947’. 

6. Reduces excise taxes on 
liquors, cosmetics, furs, jewelry, 
luggage, theater admissions, 
Iransportation, etc., to the 1942 
level, effective next July 1. 

7. Repeals the $5 use tax on 
automobiles and boats as of July 
l, 1946. 

8. ‘'Freezes'’ the old-age pen- 
sion payroll tax at the present 
level of 1 per cent each on em- 
ployers and employees through 
1946. 

Passage of the bill came at the 
end of a brief debate lasting les 
than a day. The legislation pro- 
gram calls for quick action on 
the measure in order that the 
Bureau of Internal Revenue may 
get out new withholding tax 
tables before Janujuy 1.

“Yes, her husband — 1 can’t

Evidently linking her husband 
and Martin by the fact that both 
were in the service, she continued. 

“I asked my husband to tell 
me before our three children 
how he would have felt if he 
had been overseas and I had 
been riding around nights with 
someone else,” 

She did not say what answer 
her husband made. 

“Do you now believe there 
was an Improper relation be- 
tween your husband and Mrs. 
Martin?” she was asked. 

“1 have no doubt,” she an- 
swered. “The suspense nearly 
killed me, but now I know.” 

“What do you intend to do 
now?” she was asked. 

“W’hat my attorney tells me 
— I shot her hut he told me to 
plead not guilty and I did.” 
Meanwhile, attorneys for Mrs. 1 
Mansfeldt disclosed they will in- ; 
voke the “unwritten law” in her 
defense when she goes to trial. 

The announcement fore- 
shadowed the bitterness of the 
coming court battle which will 



long shot. 

For, jubilant over victory, Sor- 
rell came right back with the 
defiant pronouncement: 

“Well continue to strike un- 
til we get everything we 
want!” 

VOTED IN MAY 



The Sorrell union’s victory wras 
established yesterday afternoon, 
when the National Labor Rela- 
tions Board office here finally 
counted the votes cast last May 
in the election to determine 
whether the Painters Union or 
the International Alliance of 
Theatrical Stage Employees, both 
A. F. L, should be bargaining 
agent with jurisdiction over 77 
studio set decorators. 

The lapse between balloting 
and counting was due to the time 
taken by the NLRB in determin- 
ing which challenges from both 
sides to void or accept. Final 
NLRB decisioy made possible 
yesterday’s counting. 

The final tally showed 55 voles

for Sorrell's union, and 45 for 
the I. A. T. S. E. 

But early hopes that this final 
vote-count might pave the way 
to peace on the strike torn Hol- 
lywood front were quickly dash- 
ed when Sorrell made his state- 
ment, followed at once by a com- 
jment from his aide, Frank Pcs- 
’ tana, who added: 

“We win continue to strike 
until our remaining two de- 
mands are met: First, that all 
strikers be returned to work 
with original status quo and 
contracts, and, second, that 
machinery be set up to handle 
future jurisdictional disputes

New Trick of Strikers 



Studio strikers tried out new tactics yesterday — the 

trick of the vanishing picket lines. 

As a result there was no vio- f “ ~

high-pressure water hoses.

Friday. 

Two major picket lines were 
set up yesterday, one at War

city policy toward picketing. 

Under this policy, the Mayor 
Said, the “legal right" to picket 
Is affirmed, but picket lines 
must be “peaceful, orderly,

BOTH VANISH- 



Both lines vanished into thin

In contrast to previous days’ 
manifestations, yesterday’s picket 
line proceedings were tame. 

At 6, the Flag was raised atop 
the studio roof and pickets and 
deputies and sightseers all stood 
at attention while the Star-Span 
gled Banner was played. A mo 
ment later, while the pickets were 
singing "God Bless America,” the 
motorcade of Lockheed workers 
arrived and the pickets went 
into a frenzy of cheers. 

The strikers’ loud speaker be- 
came vehement. It bellowed a 
chant which the pickets took up 
— an anti-Sheriff Biscailuz chant, 



future strike picketing within grated peacefully when, over 

their own loudspeaker. Sheriff's 
Inspector John Henry ordered 



City limits. 

PEACEFUL DAY- 



The decisive vote tally was the 
highlight development of a day 
which, for the first time since 
last Friday, saw no violence or 
bloodshed or arrests on the pick- 
et-line battlefront. 

Picket lines were established, 
both- at Warner Brothers and 
Universal. Both lines vanished 
when police and deputies went 
Into combat position in midday. 
As a result, only token lines re- 
mained at both studios. 

Yesterday’s vote count by the 
NLRB here was undertaken 
when Stewart Meacham, head of 
the agency’s Los Angeles office, 
received instructions from Wash- 
ington to make the tally. He got 
the ballots from safe deposit, 
and in the presence of Sorell and 
aides, and representatives of the 
T. A. T. S. E. and the producers, 
counted them. 



3 THROWN OUT- 



There were 103 in all. They 
had been cast last May by both 
the striking decorators and the 
replacements hired by the 
studios. Of the 103 ballots, three 



them to disperse. 

Disappearance of the mass 
pickets left at each studio only 
token picket lines — four men and 
women at each gate, as allowed 
by the legal injunctions Issued 
last week. Thesq made no effort, 
beyond jeers and catcalls, to 
interfere with movement of work- 
ers or automobiles into the struck 
lots. 

The dodge of the vanishing 
picket lines was manifest after 
an early-morning fizzle of strike 
leaders’ boasts that “20,000 pick- 
ets would be on the line.” 

That boast was uttered 
Wednesday afternoon, after po 
lice had arrested nearly 400 
pickets at the Warners lot. 

Strike Boss Herbert Sorrell 
shouted through the loudspeak- 
ers that 20,000 Lockheed aircraft 
workers would join the studio 
picket lines at dawn. 



At about 7, when the deputies 
still withheld action, some 500 of 
the picket line — which by now to- 
taled about 1200 — detached them- 
3elvcs and transferred to Univer- 
sal Studios. Their appearance 
there was sudden and unexpected 
and effected a quick shutdown of 
production on the Universal lot, 
where five pictures had been 
shooting. 



600 SHOW UP 

The ' Lockheed workers 



did 



show up. But instead of 20,000 
of them, there were barely 600 
They paraded peaceably. They

were rejected. Of the remaining petered out until but a handful

that it would take about five 
days to get back the NLRB’s 
official certification of thp

Meantime, it was presumed, 



Nevertheless, the Lockheed 
plant reported that in at least 
two of its departments, produc

Plans for a mass meeting at 
the Olympic Auditorium Satur- 
day at 8 p. m. were discussed 
last night by the Citizens Com- 
mittee for the Motion Picture 
Strikers. About 265 delegates 
representing .79 organizations 
met at the Royal Palms Hotel. 

The strike broke out originally 
over the matter settled by yes- 



away. 

Another angle of the strike 
situation yesterday came in a 
statement by a group of 145 war 
veterans, studio workers, who 
protested that the actions of 
strike leaders and pickets was 
’’un-American" and a "violation 
of the service men’s Bill of 
Rights."

nations with producers. The perior Court> of a maas sult by 



I. A. T. S. E. protested. The pro- 
ducers declined to negotiate until 
the NLRB certified either union 
as bargaining agent. 

The painters did not wait, but 
called a strike in mid -March. 
The studios hired replacements 
from the I. A. T. S. E. In the 
Intervening months', many other 
film unions, representing thous- 
ands of workers, have walked 
out in sympathy strikes.

55000 actual and $5000 punitive

they claim to have sustained 
while picketing Warner Brothers 
Studio last week. 

The pickets claimed they were

land other weapons, and were

TURNED AWAY - 



The pickets stayed there, ward- 
ing off all who tried to enter. Ac- 
tors Donald Meek, Basil Rath- 
bone and Director Fritz Lang 
were turned away. Actress Maria 
Montez had entered the studio 
before the pickets appeared. She 
••emalned inside. 

At noon, plans were laid to 
run a studio truck into the main 
gate, through the picket line. The 
strike leaders learned of it, and 
learned that three busloads of 
uniformed police were nearby to 
guard the truck’s entrance. At 
once, .the picket line evaporated— 
jCst vanished— leaving a handful 
of placard -bearers at the gate. 

Meantime, Sheriff Biscailuz had 
ordered dispersal of the picket 
line at Warner Brothers. The 
order was read to the pickets by 
Inspector John Henry of the sher- 
iff’s office, who sai^: 

“All right, now; you’ve had a 
nice parade. Now get hack on 
the. sidewalk.” Meekly, with no 
disorder, the pickets obeyed, 
leaving only four pickets at the 
main gate. 

For the first time during the 
strike, moves were made yester- 
day to Interest District Attorney 
Fred N. Howser in the strike pic- 
ture. The District Attorney can- 
not be called In unless felony 
prosecutions are contemplated. 
To Howser yesterday went 
Undersheriff A. C. Jewell, for a 
half-hour conference. Jewell later 
said he had merely laid the sit- 
uation before the prosecutor, but 
he denied he had discussed pos 
sible felony actions against 
strike leaders. 

Later, Howser conferred with 
Blayney Matthews, Warner 
Brothers' police chief, and Mayor 
Brown of Burbank. None would 
discuss details of the conference, 
but Matthews did not deny he 
had suggested felony action 
against the strike bosses. 

Late yesterday, the Sheriffs 
office announced that in view of 
the strike situation, the office 
and deputies would remain on 
full duty today despite the fact 
It is a holiday, Columbus Day.

.. pagei The Jap had showed his hand bv now. 
.'.'..pan He would not strike near the Zambales 
! coast. So I asked MacArthur to release the 
Thirty-First Division from my command 
and to give me the Ninety-First, lock, stock 
and barrel. It had only been attached to 
me; not mine. 

WORD CAME BACK TO ME FROM 
MANILA THAT MACARTHUR AP- 
PROVED, AND AT THE SAME TIME 
CAME A MACARTHUR ORDER FOR 
MY NORTH LUZON FORCE TO HOLD 
THE ENEMY NORTH OF AN EAST-TO- 
WEST LINE RUNNING- ACROSS THE 
. NARROW COASTAL PLAIN 50 MILES 
t BELOW VIGAN AT SAN FERNANDO

WAY SOUTH FOR THE VIGAN LAND- 
ING* FORCES, AND THAT WAS 
STRAIGHT SOUTH DOWN THE 
COASTAL PLAIN. THE MOUNTAINS 
ON THEIR LEFT AND THE CHINA 
SEA ON THEIR RIGHT BLOCKED ANY 
OTHER ROUTE. 

The Japs came down the coastal plain 
on December 21 and collided with one bat- 
talion of the Thirteenth Infantry Regiment 
and one battalion of the Twelfth near San 
Juan, five miles north of San Fernando. 

Outflanked by the power of the enemy, 
and because of inexperience, my men dis- 
persed and were cut off from the main 
body. Scattered remnants of the ruptured 
units fled into the mountains to the east, 
and filtered back to us in small groups for 
the next two weeks. 

Tribute to Heroes 

The senior American officers with the 
Thirteenth and the Twelfth Infantry Regi- 
ments, Lieutenant Colonels Moses and 
Noble, and Major .Toe Ganahl, were three of 
the finest combat officers in my command. 
Ganahl, a spirited Texan, fought as few 
men have ever fought until the fall of 
Bataan. And then, when he must have seen 
with haggard eyes the faint ray of libera- 
tion, he met his death near the end of the 
war when a Navy submarine torpedoed a 
Jap prison ship filled with our men. 

ONLY GOD KNOWS WHAT HAP- 
PENED TO NOBLE AND MOSES . . . 
BRAVE MEN. 

They took to the mountains after the 
fall of Bataan and succeeded in organizing 
a fair-sized guerrilla force with which they 
proceeded to harass the Japs for many

months, ambushing, raiding and living the 
rugged life of the hunted. 

Stories of their indomitable spirit 
reached us in whispered reports from men 
who had seen them or had first-hand in- 
formation of what they accomplished. 

But at last Noble and Moses decided to 
surrender. Their provisions and arms had 
been reduced to nothingness. They listened, 
at long last, to the constant appeals to them 
by the Japs to surrender. They would be 
treated as honorable prisoners of war, the- 
Japs told them, if they would only come out 
of their hiding places and surrender. 

Heroes in Dungeons 

NOBLE AND MOSES GAVE UP. 
THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY 
SLAPPED INTO A DUNGEON IN THE 
OLD WALLED CITY AT FORT SANTI- 
AGO AND, FROM ALL REPORTS, 
WERE BEATEN AND TORTURED 
OVER A SHOCKING PERIOD OF TIME. 
THEY WERE LATER SEEN AT BILI- 
BID PRISON BY SEVERAL OF OUR 
MEN. THEY HAD BEEN STARVED 
UNTIL THEY WERE LITTLE MORE 
THAN SKELETONS. ONE OF THEM 
APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN

JAP LANDING ™ This picture from a 

captured Jap film shows Nip soldiers landing at Lin- 



aging. But we were not backing up — yet. 
I pushed the Seventy-First Infantry and a 
battalion of field artillery northward, 
under Colonel Donald Bonnett, to hit the 
head of the Jap column and attempt to 
delay its sweep southward from the Yigan 
area. Bonnett took off up the coastal road 
with what buses I was able to give him. 

But that night of December 21-22 the 
Japs landed 16 more transports just south 







BESTING IIP * General Jonathan M. 

Wainwright rests up at White Sulphur Springs, W. Va. 
Here the general is holding the “big stick^ presented

of Bauang and along the shores of Lingayen 
Gulf down as far as Agoo, which faced the 
Eleventh Division’s right flank. One Jap 
landing force moved inland behind the 
more northerlv section of Bonnett’s north- 
going command. 

The Japs hit Bonnett on the morning 
of December 22 and simultaneously put 
heavy pressure on the right flank of the 
Eleventh, which was to the south of Bon- 
nett at San Fabian. 

Knowing that Bonnett’s position was 
untenable, I ordered the lower portion of 
his force, which was going north, to turn 
and come back down the coastal plain, pass 
Rosario and regain the comparative safety 
of our right flank stretching along the base 
of -Lingayen Gulf. 

As for Bonnett himself and his more 
northerly force f / ordered that they com 
tinue north to Bauang , get on the Nagui - 
lian Road which winds up the mountains to 
Baguio and then come back to us through 
a southern-bound mountain road known 
as the Kennon road . 

I made it plain that Bonnett must nego- 
tiate this circuitous route with as much 
speed as possible; that it was imperative (as 
I will explain a bit later) that he and his 
men be out of the Kennon Road by dark on 
the 22nd. 

Something Went Wrong 

Something went wrong. Bonnett went 
up the snaking Xaguilian Road to Baguio 
all right, successfully evading the enemy 
force then coming down from Yigan. But 
he halted his men at Baguio for food and 
rest. I had no way of knowing that he did 
this, for I was even then planning a 
maneuver which might blunt the Jap force 
or lessen its effectiveness, but if the latter 
had to be the case I would have to sacrifice 
the Kennon Road — Bonnett’s escape route. 

My plan was to hit the south-bound 
Jap spearhead with the best-seasoned men 
in my command— the Twenty-Sixth Cav- 
alry — and at the same time contain the 
forces which were landing in the vicinity 
of Damortis (on the eastern beaches and 
half-way down Lingayen Gulf). These 
later forces, linked with even more 
southerly landings, were the ones threaten- 
ing to cave in the Eleventh’s right flank 
near San Fabian. 

The Twenty-Sixth got up to Damortis 
and hit the Japs landing there, and others 
coming from the north, with all it had. 
With a little more punch and fortune, the 
Twenty-Sixth might have sprayed the Japs 
all over the coastal plain. 

But the enemy called for planes, which

PROTEST VETS' 



In accordance with a settle- 
ment of their marriage differ- 
ences, Mrs. Mildred Selznick yes- 
terday waived all alimony and 
child support claims against 
Howard Selznick, member ofRhe 
film family. 

The waivers were contained in 
a stipulation filed in Superior 
Court by Attorney Lester Roth 
representing Selznick in the pend- 
ing divorce suit brought by Mrs. 
Selznick. 

At the time Mrs. Selznick filed 
the suit counsel revealed that 
she had made an out of court 
settlement of her $650,000 court 
suit brought against the Selz- 
nick family, including her hus- 
band’s brothers, David, the pro- 
ducer, and the late Myron Selz- 
nick, agent. 

She had charged in the support 
suit that the family agreed to 
pay her a stipulated sum each 
month if sheVould not sue How- 
ard for divorce. 

Attorney Roth said that the 
stipulation filed yesterday will 
clear the way for her to obtain 
a default divorce.

Rising living costs in the Los 
Angeles area were blamed yes- 
terday upon the chickens. 

Egg prices went up 8 per cent 
and this was held responsible for 
the over-all .5 per cent rise in food 
costs.- 

In revealing an upward trend 
In living costs, Charles A. Rou- 
masset, local economist for the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, cited: 

The living cost index in this 
area now is 130.9 per cent of the 
1935-39 average, which Is 2.6 
above last year’s estimate. 

Over the six years between 
August, 1939, and V-J Day, liv 
lng costs went up 30 per cent. 

The cost of food advanced 54 
per cent; clothing 40 per cent; 
house furnishings, 42 per cent, 
and miscellaneous goods, 25 per 
cent. 

Rents went up 3 per cent. 
Fuel, electricity and ice have 
declined 6 per cent. 

Lack of Labor 
Perils Crops 

War workers and discharged 
service men are not seeking agri- 
cultural employment and the 
farm labor situation remains 
critical, a California State Cham- 
ber of Commerce Southern 
Council meeting at the Biltmore 
was told yesterday. 

A. J. McFadden, agricultural 
committee chairman, said that 
due to farm labor shortages, 
more crop losses are likely than 
any time during the war. Re- 
porting on a survey at one Army 
camp, he said that only 3.2 of 
the personnel indicated they 
would go to farms when dis- 
charged. 

Following the committee re- 
port, the Council recommended 
that the 50,000 Mexican and 
Jamaican workers brought in to 
work on farms as a war measure 
be permitted to stay to harvest 
1946 crops. 

Under federal policies, it was 
pointed out, they will leave the 
state by January 1. 

Other resolutions adopted in- 
cluded: ✓ 

That the Army recondition and 
evacuate the Los Angeles County 
Fair Grounds by January 1 . 

That a Los Angeles office of 
the surplus property division of 
the United States Department of 
Commerce with full authority to 
dispose of property be estab- 
lished in Los Angeles ‘Where the 
major portion of the state’s con- 
sumer goods is located.” 

At present, it was pointed out, 
actions of the local office must 
be cleared through San Fran 
cisco. 

That a conduit linking San 
Diego with the Metropolitan 
aqueduct be constructed as 
planned by the Navy during the 
war, but now abandoned. Under 
its present supply system, in 
case of a sustained drought, San 
Diego ’’would face disaster,” the 
resolution declared. 




Operations of the city -owned 
Department of Water and Power 
last fiscai year resulted in the 
highest net income in history— 
$19,516,337, according to a fin- 
ancial statement released yester- 
day. 

The figures were for the year 
ending June 30. 

The water system showed a 
net of $5,250,824, the electric sys- 
tem $14,265,513, out of gross in- 
come from both systems of $57,- 
850,329. 

Assets of the water system 
were appraisfed at $194,697,478, 
outstanding bonds at $51,181,250 
and an earned surplus of $50,- 
816,590. 

RECORD ASSETS 

Electric system assets total 
$316,371,514, outstanding bonds 
3108,533,245, and earned surplus 
$111,101,959. 

President Robert A. Heffner of 
the board of commissioners said 
that the record total assets came 
about through being unable to 
make no capital expenditures 
during the war. 

Now that materials are avail- 
able. Heffner said, the assets 
would help “finance the depart- 
ment's postwar construction pro- 
gram which will provide thou- 
sands of jobs for veterans and 
displaced war plant workers.” 

Between the water and electric 
systems, a total of $16,700,000 on 
improvements will be spent by 
June 30, 1946, Heffner stated. 

No U. S. Work in 
Sight for Calship 

No Government work is in sight 
for the California Ship Building 
Corporation at Wilmington after 
the yard delivers its last Victory 
ship on October 22, the Maritime 
Commission announced yesterday. 

It was pointed out that Calship 
“could bid for the construction 
of vessels for private operators," 
but added that “no such work 
now is available, and the commis- 
sion "did not know” how soon 
such bids might be asked. 



PASADENA, Oct. 11. — “If 
this variance is granted, 1 will 
feel that my 11 -year-old daugh- 
ter is not safe.” 

That statement today by Mrs. 
Frances Dick, 480 West Montana, 
was similar to those of 418 other 
residents of northwest Pasadena, 
who have expressed opposition to 
leasing of the west campus of 
Pasadena Junior College to the 
Veterans’ Administration as a 
domiciliary home for returned 
fighting men. 

Half-a-hundred of the vigor- 
ously protesting residents today 
attended a public hearing at the 
City Hall on an application for a 
zoning variance. 

"It would be detrimental to 
the best interests of property 
owners,” said R. W. Ware, pres- 
ident of the Arroyo Seco Im- 
provement Association, In a 
letter which was read at the 
hearing, '

Signed by 11 other residents, 
a second letter, stating that "It 
would be used by a floating 
population of veterans who 
travel the United States by the 
seasons of the year," a second 
letter, also read at today's 
hearing, opposed the move. 

Superintendent of Schools John 
A. Bexscn, speaking for the 
Board of Education, as applicant 
for the variance, said he could 
find no grounds for the belief 
that undesirables would be 
housed or property values re- 
duced. 

Colonel R. A. Bringham, man- 
ager of the Sawtelle Hospital, 
assured the gathering that vet- 
erans housed there would be 
“practically incapacitated duty 
patients," with no bedridden or 
mental cases. 

A decision by the city planning 
commission on the application is 
expected next week.

Entertained a group of unsuspecting friends the other 
night with home movies of my Alaskan trip. Although it 
wasn’t exactly the Alaskan trip. ... I showed scenes from 
"Princess and the Pirate” while Colonna ran through the 
room dressed like a polar hear. 

My favorite scene Is a glacier just sotfth of Fairbanks. 
I got so excited watching it, the picture was over before I’d 
got around to taking up all the tickets. 

But those home movle-machincs are Intricate. They’d 
baffle the average man, and I found out -1 was average when 
the lights went out and the vacuum cleaner started playing 
"I’m Going to Take a Sentimental Journey." • 

The salesman told me that a child could run the movie 
projector. I knew I should have bought one that a man 
could run. The audience was a little surprised when the first 
scene showed a sandy strip with a camel coming at them tall 
first. So was I until I found out that Instead of lAIaska, I 
was showing my African trip backward. 

When the picture finally started, everyone sat glued to 
his chair but Skinnay Ennis. He’s so*thln even the ironhound 
stickum I use wouldn’t hold him in place. 

Most of the scenes were of me walking, me riding, me 
skiing . . . and I was afraid the audience was getting a little 
tired ... so I showed them scenes of me lying down.

old sea-dogs— Admiral William S. 
Halsey— at Tenth and Broadway 
next Wednesday morning at 11 
a. m. 

The admiral will arrive at Mu-

starting point of the short parade 
in an escorted motorcade, Mayor 
Fletcher Bow'ron said yesterday. 

The downtown parade, which is 
to end at the City Hall with a

be a big affair, said the Mayor. 
It is merely designed to “let Los 
Angeles see the admiral.” 

At the City Hall, u'here the 
official welcome will be given, 



Halsey may or may not speak-

The facts about violence 

AT WARNER BROS. STUDIO! 



For over six months motion pictur# studio onions, oil members of the American Federation 
of Labor, have been engaged in a jurisdictional dispute over control of the set deco- 
rators, A. F. of L. local. 



Over six months ago the matter was referred to the National Labor Relations Board. 
Warner Bros., along with other studios publicly stated that they would abide by the 
ruling of the NLRB whenever a ruling was issued. 



For six months, In the absence of a NLRB ruling, the studios have been picketed by 
the striking unions. These pickets have represented approximately 2500 studio workers 
In the motion picture Industry. Over 14,000 other studio employees, all A. F. of L. union 
members, have reported regularly for work, crossing the picket lines at the Instruction 
of their unions. 

For six months picketing at id itiNOes, though vigorous owl .active, was, for the most 
part, orderly and peaceful. 

On Friday, October 5, the striking unions put Into effect a new technique. Instead ef 
picketing all studios equally they decided to concentrate their full strength on one 
studio at a time and for strategic reasons they started on Warner Bros. And before 
4:00 A. M. Friday, over 1000 pickets were massed In front of the Warner studio auto 
gate. Within a few minutes the first three automobiles attempting to drive Into the 
studio grounds were overturned without warning. 

As studio employees came to work, those who attempted to enter the studio were 
manhandled, roughed and beaten. Young girls and women were knocked down and 
beaten while the pickets make it abundantly clear that anyone attempting to cress the 
picket line weuld be dealt with In a similar manner. 

At 9:50 A. M., Friday, October 5, Herbert Sorrell, the strike leader, told Police Chief 
Adams of the city of Burbank: "We are going to close this studio and if we have to 
we are going to close It by violence." 

As this condition developed It soon became apparent that the studio was in a state ef 
siege ond as violence increased a state of riot was officially declared by the Chief of 
Police of the city of Burbank. Police from neighboring cities were called for assistance 
by the local authorities and police officers were forced to resort to tear gas In an 
effort to quell the riot. 

On Saturday morning, October 4, the Superior Court of the State of California, in and 
for the Los Angeles County, issued a restraining order restraining the various unions 
which were participating In the picketing from using violence, threats or intimidation 
and from mass picketing, the order limiting the number of pickets to a total of twenty. 
The restraining order was served upon the strike leader on the date of Its Issue and 
was repeatedly read over a loudspeaker system to the massed pickets by a deputy sheriff 
of Los Angeles County. The order was openly defied and flouted by the strike leader 
and booed and |eered by the pickets. 

A similar riot occurred on Monday, October 8. 

Since Friday morning, October 5, the studio has been constantly besieged. Men and 
women have been beaten not only upon entering the studio but upon leaving it. Hundreds 
of studio employees have been forced to remain In the studio day and night since then 
In order to avoid physical ln|ury as pickets have been seen carrying clubs, rocks, bottles, 
chains and blackjacks. 

In addition to actual violence, pickets have used every terroristic device to frighten and 
intimidate studio workers- They have taken the names and automobile license numbers 
ef employees approaching the studio. They have photographed employees as they have 
entered the studio, threatening them with harm at a later date. They have phoned 
employees both at the studio and at their homes, threatening them and their families 
with ln|ury and death and have followed employees to their homes. And all this In an 
industry which is 100*4 unionized. 

Since Monday, October 8, In the late afternoon and evening, goon squads have roamed 
the streets of Burbank In the vicinity of the studio, waiting to attack studio employees 
as they left for their homes. Some of our employees have been badly beaten as they 
went to their cars, while ethers have had their cars stopped an lonely roads, where 
they have been assaulted. 

In the face of this lawless condition, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc., has adhered strictly 
to a policy ef leaving all enforcement methods to the properly constituted police officers. 

We have nof employed nor will we employ anyone to Interfere with lawful or 
unlawful picketing. 

We firmly believe that lawlessness on the port of the strikers does nof juitlfy 
It for us. At no time hat there been any Interference with peaceful olekotlnq. Our 
only course Is to roly on governmental authority to enforce the peace at wall at 
to adludleato labor dlsputo s. 

The law enforcement officers, namely, Sheriff Blscallux of Los Angeles County, Police 
Chiefs Elmer Adams of Burbank, Verts Rasmussen of Glendale and C. B. Horrall of 
Los Angeles, and the police officers under their respective commands are entitled to 
public commendation for their efforts to enforce the law, protect law-abiding citizens 
and to preserve order against overwhelming odds. 

We want to express our profound admiration tor the courage, spirit and loyalty ef the 
hundreds of our employees, many of whom were seriously injured in the violence, who 
refused to be Intimidated and who have risked physical Injury to themselves and their 
families In order to maintain their right to work. In doing so, they are helping to preserve 
the free Institutions of America and to oppose those forces which are jeopardizing the 
welfare of labor In this country. 

Even under these difficult conditions. Warner Bros, will continue to respect the right 
of free assembly in line with Its established policy in COMBINING GOOD CITIZENSHIP 
WITH GOOD PtCTURE-MAKING.

Hope for Counter 
Attack Abandoned 

(Continued From Page Six) 

strafed our men and liorses without fear of 
aerial counterattack. We lost more of our 
few first-class fighting men that day at 
Damortis, and a number of fine horses, in- 
cluding my “Little Boy,” who took a bullet 
through his head. 

Another reason the Twenty-Sixth 
failed there was that the tank support I 
tried to give it fell far below expectations. 
The tanks, standard seven-ton light tanks 
of that day, were operating in my area but 
were under the independent command of 
Brigadier General James R. N. Weaver. 

I asked that a company ( 16 ) of them 
be sent to Damortis to help the Twenty- 
Sixth in its difficult and varied mission. In- 
stead, only a platooon of five was sent, and 
it was not nearly enough. The platoon 
fought as well as it could against the Japs, 
whose light mortars and pie-pan mines 
were death on such tanks, especially when 
there were not many to contend with. Suf- 
fice it to say that those tanks should have 
been wholly mine, or not at all. 

But on its alternate mission the 
Twenty-Sixth more than made good. When 
it withdrew it succeeded in pulling the Japs 
to the eastward toward Rosario, fighting 
gallant delaying actions all the way. 

As I foresaw, the Twenty-Sixth backed 
across the Kennon Road, and when the 
Japs followed they thus cut off Bonnett 
and liis resting men. The Twenty-Sixth 
continued its battling withdrawal until it 
reached and crossed the Bued River, below 
and east of Rosario. 

One Unit Isolated 



Bonnett and his men were isolated 
somewhere up the sacrificed Kennon Road. 
But the Eleventh’s shakv flank, indeed our 
whole right side, would now be crumpled. 

The Twenty- Sixth's withdrawal was 
made possible by a thousand acts of valor, 
but none exceeded the courage of that of 
Major T. J. H. Trapnell, a fine football and 
polo player and a fine officer who had 
served under me when I was commander of 
the Third Cavalry before the war. 

“Trap” commanded the Twenty- 
Sixth’s rear guard as it pulled the Japs 
eastward. Jap tanks were pressing him 
severely as he edged back. About halfway 
between Damortis and Rosario he came 
upon a wooden bridge over a deep, muddy 
stream, impracticable for tanks to ford. So 
he commandeered a truck and jammed it 
sideways across the important little bridge. 
The Jap tanks were within range of him 
now and giving him everything they had. 
But he calmly took out his pistol, shot the 
car carburetor off the truck’s engine, set 
the thing on fire and got away — a feat for 
which he eventually was given the Dis- 
tinguished Service Cross. 

“Trap’s” war was to end, and God 
knows what indignities to begin , when Ba- 
taan fell. He survived not only his im- 
prisonment but also escaped from the sink- 
ing prison ship which carried Ganahl and 
so many others to their deaths a few short 
months before the end of the long war. 

From my new field headquarters at 
Alcala, on the Agno River just below the 
base of Lingavcn Gulf, I ordered the bat- 
tered and weary Twenty-Sixth Cavalry re- 
lieved bv the Seventy-First Division, and 
sent the cavalrymen back to the village of 
Binalonan to lick their wounds. They had 
suffered about 150 men killed and wounded 
in the fighting from Damortis to the Bued, 
and one troop of about 100 men had been 
detached and stationed at Bontoc in the 
mountains to keep the Japs from moving 
up into Baguio by the Xaguilian Road. 

On the same afternoon, December 23, 

I telephoned MacArthurs headquarters, 
told it we had a brief breathing spell, and

suggested that my right flauk and the 
whole line could be strengthened jf I could 
withdraw behind the Agno River. Mac- 
Arthur sent immediate approval. 

Then I told headquarters that I be- 
lieved I could launch an attack from the 
Agno River line if I could have the services 
of my old Philippine Division. Headquar- 
ters directed me to submit my plans for the 
counterattack. 

“I’ll get my plans there as soon as 
possible,” I shouted into the phone. “But 
give me an answer now on whether I get 
the Philippine Division.” 

There was a little delav. Then the voice 

* 

came back. 

“It’s highly improbable,” the voice 

said. 

The bubble of mv counterattack ambi- 
tions was bursting. Any novice could see 
that without the Philippine Division there 
would be no attack. This division knew the 
essentials of combat. The Philippine Army 
divisions I was then preparing to string 
along the south bank of the Agno had 
neither the training, nor the equipment and 
discipline, for attack. 

Nevertheless, on that night of Decem- 
ber 23 I was working on my counterattack- 
ing plans — forlorn as they were now be- 
coming — when a phone 'call from Mac- 
Arthur’s headquarters stopped everything. 

It was Pete Irwin calling. 

“WPO-3 is in effect,” Pete said. 

It was a bitter pill to swallow, for War 
Plan Orange No. 3 meant the last ditch; the 
long-ago-planned desperation withdrawal 
to Bataan. I guess I must have been silent 
too long for Irwin on the other end of the 
line. 

“You understand?” he asked. 

“Yes, I understand,” I said quietly. 

That was not all. MacArthur, I 
learned, was about to leave Manila and take 
his headquarters to Corregidor. 

A soldier’s world is where he is figlit- 
ing. Mine wa s falling to pieces. 

TOMORROW: A warning for the 

future. The Japs hit hard and fast.

• With this phase of the Jap Invasion of the 
Philippines, the real, bitter fighting began. 
As may be seen from this map, the Japs 
drove southward following the coastal 
roads (indicated by open arrows). At Tagu- 
din (1) the Japs' from the Vigan landing 
overcame light U. S. opposition and headed 
toward S. Fernando (2), where they met the 
71st Infantry, sent from the south to stop 
the Jap advance. Due to the new Jap land- 
ing (3) along the coast between S. Fernando 
and Damortis, -the 71st Infantry was forced 
to retire to Baguio City. The Philippine Army 
whfch was also at S. Fernando was forced 
to disperse and flee to the mountains (indi- 
cated by group of small arrows). The Japs 
from landing (3) now teamed up with the 
Japs heading southward and continued on 
to Damortis (4). Again the U. S. attempt to 
stem the Jap's drive was unsuccessful, and 
the units of the 11th Division with tanks, 
and also the 26th Cavalry which had joined 
in this attempt were forced to withdraw. 
The units of the 1 1 th rejoined its main body 
(indicated by arrow 5), while the 26th 
Cavalry moved along the road leading 
through Rosario and Sison to Binalonan 
(indicated by arrow 6). In the meantime, 
the 71st Division (less the 71st Regiment 
now at Baguio City) was moved northward 
to Sison to relieve the 26th Cavalry which 
had suffered severe casualties.

RUKEYSER Advertising Can Build 



Inter-Group Harmony 

BY M. S. RUKEYSER 

InVl Newa Service Financial Commentator — 



he attended by the slain woman's 
husband, Navy Warrant Officer 
Wilbur ("Pat") Martin, who de- 
mands that an "example" be 
made of Mrs. Mansfeldt to pre- 
vent the killing of other wive9 
on mere "suspicion." 

Martin, who voiced his atti- 
tude to District Attorney Edmund 
G. Brown during a long inter- 
view today, did not, however, ask 
the death penalty, and Brown 
later declared the prosecution 
would not do so, either. 

“This case," he explained, 
“will be presented as one of 
murder In the first degree. But 
as to the penalty — that will be 
up to the Judge and the Jury. 
The state will make no specific 
request." 

When told of the defense plan 
to invoke the "unwritten law," 
Brown said he had expected as 
much, because there was no 
bther explanation for the fact 
that Mrs. Mansfoldt’s lawyers, 
as well as prosecution, have been 
making a hunt for evidence to 
show that “romantic relations" 
had existed between Nurse Mar- 
tin and Dr. Mansfeldt, who took 
his own life a few hours after 
learning she had been shot and 
killed by Mrs. Mansfeldt. 



PITTSBURGH, Oct. 11.— If advertising comes of age in this 
transitional period, it can develop important new uses and func- 
tions.

TACTICS BARED- 



"Our purpose In developing 
■uoh information, " the district 
attorney continued, "is to pre- 
vent the defense from using n 
lack of It ns evidence of In- 
sanity. In other words, they 
could claim that Mrs. Mans- 
feldt's suspicions were delu- 
sions, mere figments of a 
disordered Imagination. We In- 
tend to show that her suspi- 
cions were very well founded." 

The other side of this phase of 
the case came from Attorney 
James M. Maclnnis. He declared: 
“It is fair to say that we In- 
tend to Invoke the ‘unwritten 
law' as one part— -a collateral 
pnrt, at leust— of Mrs. Mans- 
feldt’s defense.” 

The defense, Maclnnis said, la 
continuing its search for a sup- 
posed secret apartment to which 
Dr. Mansfeldt reportedly ar- 
ranged for the delivery of a 
trunk belonging to Mrs. Martin. 
"Also," the lawyer went on, 
"we have received a call from 
a nurse at the Sutter Hospital, 
where Mrs. Martin was em- 
ployed, confirming other re- 
pqrts that she and Dr. >Lans- 
feldt had been seen 'embrac- 
ing and kissing’ at* the hos- 
pital."

In the past, business was so busy 
selling products in unprecedented

"By smashing the naturally oc- 
curring molecules,” Mr, Arnold 
explained, “new species have been 
produced which release a greater 
percentage of energy when ig* 
nlted In the cylinder of an auto- 
mobile engine, resulting In a lux- 
ury of power and mileage. 

fi Oil scientists, while developing 
more powerful fuels to meet war- 
time needs, ajso found that the 
same type of motor fuel produced 
by smashing larger molecules can 
be produced by causing smaller 
molecules to combine. These small 
molecules, found principally In 
natural gas, proved of tremen- 
dous importance during the war 
in the development of aviation 
fuels."

MJENOS AIRES, 

Oct. 12. — Argentina’s acute 
political crisis swept to a new, 
bloody climax tonight as po-

an hour-long battle in the

Eyewitnesses reported many 
dead and more than 100 
wounded. Some 800 police fought 
thousands of demonstrators with 
machlneguns and gas grenades. 
W’opnen and children were said to 
be among those slain.

Canadian Income 
Tax Cut 16 Pet. 

OTTAWA, Oct. 12. — UP) — The 
Canadian government tonight an- 
nounced a 16 per cent reduction 
in the personal income tax, along 
with other slashes in the war- 
time tax structure. 



First help for the stricken 
Americans and natives on Oki- 
nawa was sped by 50 Marianas- 
based B-29's, which had been as- 
sembled for the scheduled inva- 
sion of Japan by force. 

They took 248 tons of food to 
^Okinawa. In the next three days 
330,000 rations will be a'.r-borne 
to the island, and a week’s sup- 
ply is to be brought up from 



Callousness Charged as 
Pair Apparently ‘Excused’ 

One whole week after the “wrong bottle’ ’ death 
of a 14-year-old school girl at the county-owned Gen- 
eral Hospital and two days after a Coroner’s jury 
had blamed the hospital for “carelessness,” no direct 
action had been taken yesterday by county or hos- 
pital officials to correct a condition that caused the 
girl’s death or to punish those held responsible, the 

Examiner discovered last night/ 

The Examiner learned that Dr. Edward Al- 
barian. whom the Coroner’s jury held to blame for 
the girl’s death, and Miss June Coleman, nurse, who 
admitted she had taken the wsong bottle from Ihe 
shelf in the operating room where the girl died, both 
still were working at flic hospital, apparently ex- 
cused by the hospital officials for their part in ihe 
tragedy. 

Xor could the Examiner find that any action 
had been taken by Arthur J. Will, superintendent 
of the county charities department, who has direct 
responsibility for the hospital’s administration, or 
by LeRov R. Bruce, director of the hospital. 

Verdict of Coroner's Jury 

Fourteen-year-old Pauline Estrada died on the 
operating table last Saturday after an injection of 
20 per cent sodium chloride had been mistakenly 
used for one of .85 of 1 per cent or normal saline 
solution. 

The Coroner’s jury at the inquest Thursday re- 
turned this verdict: 

“Death was caused by hematolysis, due to in- 
troduction of a strong saline solution into the blood 
stream, other conditions, acute appendicitis with 
ruptured appendix, said saline solution having 
been injected intravenously by Dr. Edward Al- 
barian at the County Hospital preparatory to sur- 
gery; and we find this to have been accidental, due 
to carelessness on the part of Dr. Edward Albarian 
and the General Hospital staff; and we recommend 
that a better system be installed in regard to segre- 
gating and labelling the various medications to be 
used.” 

Apparently Will, and Director Bruce, and all 
other officials, except two investigating deputies 
from the Sheriff’s office, chose to ignore the jury’s 
verdict and had done nothing to correct the condi- 
tion that has already caused at least three such 
deaths in the past four years. 

Complete Investigation Sought 

But outraged demands for a complete investi- 
gation and action in the Estrada case and for a clean- 
compiotf destruction of one of jUp of supervisory conditions at the General Hospital, 
our most important war instaiia- 1 were forthcoming from Attorney William S. Palhiese, 

representing the Estrada family. Indignant over the 
apparent calloused indifference of high authorities, 
Pa I m esc declared : 

“We want a thorough-going inquiry by the au- 
thorities who are responsible under the law— the 
county grand jury and the District Attorney. 

We want an investigation that finally will go 
to the roots of the conditions that exist at the 
hospital, that will definitely fix responsibility, 
bring those responsible to swift justice and correct,

OTHER CASES - 



‘There Is no physiological 
use for sodium chloride, and it 
Is ridiculous that anyone with 
any medical understanding 
would pick up a Ivottle so la- 
beled for use Intravenously.” 
Indicative of the lack of official 
action in th« case was the glaring 
absence from the Coroner’s in- 
quest of a Deputy District Attor- 
ney. 

The only county representative 
present — other than Sheriffs 
Lieutenants Garner Brown and 
Ray T. Hopkinson— was Deputy 
County Counsel Jesse Frampton. 
The latter asked no questions. 
He was there to look out for 
the county’s interests in the not 
improbable event of a civil claim 
for extensive damages. 

Brown and Hopkinson will pre- 
sent their evidence to the Dis- 
trict Attorney’s office Monday. 

The Estrada case was but 
another in the list of known 
“wrong bottle” deaths at the Gen- 
eral Hospital, not to mention a 
host of other serious conditions 
that have been charged against 



In November, 1944, Mrs. Belen 
C. Mendoza, 43, mother of 11 chil- 
dren, was under treatment for 
high blood pressure at the Gen- 
eral Hospital. 

She was to have been admin- 
istered a 10 per cent solution of 
magnesium sulphate. 

What she got was a saturated 
solution of about 66 per cent — 
and sudden death. 

In September. 1941, Mrs. Mary 
Clifton, 38-year-old widow, was a 
patient at the General Hospital. 
Doctors were trying to find out 
why she had headaches. They or- 
dered a blood sugar tolerance 
test, requiring injection of glu- 
cose. 

Instead she received an injec- 
tion of urea cyanide. Death was 
quick. 



LATEST VICTIM- 



But despite all the promises 
that “something will be done” 
that followed these two deaths, 
Pauline Estrada was dead yes- 
terday, victim of the same 
“wrong bottle" technique. 

The student, who lived at 333^

Mother Tells 
Tragic Events 



“ I don’t understand what 
happened to my little girl . , , 
I’m so confused . . .” 

Weeping softly, Mrs. Jessie 
Estrada yesterday gropingly 
tried to piece together the tragic 
train of events which led to the 
“wrong bottle” death of her 
daughter, Pauline, last Saturday 
at General Hospital. 

As her four other children — 
Julia, 17, Mary Lou, 13, Sally, 11, 
and Manuel, 9 — tried to console 
her, the 33-year-old mother re- 
called the happenings leadings, to 
the tragedy.

9:30 a. m. She had complained of 
a pain the evening before. 

A neighbor took her to the Gen- 
eral Hospital and the girl’s 
mother stayed with her for a 
time, then went home. 

“At 2 o’clock,’’ said Mrs. Es- 
trada, “a neighbor gave us a 
message that Pauline was go- 
ing to be operated on. 

“I went to the church and lit 
some candles. Then I went to 
the hospital. I had to wait a 
long time, and finally a doctor 
came out and said lie was sorry 
— Pauline had just passed 
away. He said he didn’t know 
why.” 

The evidence showed that the 
“wrong bottle” was labeled “So- 
dium Chloride 20% Doctors said 
a properly labeled bottle would 




Instructions for administration 
of 1000 cc’s of normal saline solu- 
tion to the Estrada girl were 
given by Dr. H. K. Dooley, osteo- 
pathic physician and surgeon in 
;he osteopathic ward where the 
girl died. 

But, when Miss Coleman went 
to the shelf where the bottles of 
normal saline solution are sup- 
posed to be kept, she picked up 
the one containing the lethal 
doze. 

She placed an intravenous unit 
on the neck of the bottle and 
placed it by the side of Pauline’s 
bed. 



DOCTOR ACTS- 



Dr. Albarian, also an osteopath 
and an “In-training interne” at 
the hospital, said he went to the 
girl’s bedside, noted the sodium 
chloride designation on the label, 
| but thought it said only 2 per 
cent. 



and osteopathic units, the 
superintendents of nurses, the 
chief pharmacist and the hospital 
engineer on “the whole matter of 
packaging and labeling.” 

What is to be done about Dr. 
Albarian and Miss Coleman, as 
> far as the hospital is concerned, 
will not be determined for some 
time, he indicated. 

He said the matter will be re- 
ferred to the "medical advisory 
board” of the hospital, which 
does not meet until November 13. 
No special meeting of the board 
will be called, he insisted. 

That was small consolation to 
a grief -stricken mother. 

“Pauline Is a good girl,” she 
cried. 

“I mean she WAS a good 
girl.” 



Pauline, she related, com- 
plained of a pain in her side Fri- 
day afternoon when she returned 
to the family home, 333% Avenue 
20, from the Florence Nightingale 
School. 

“By 5:30 Saturday morning, 
the pain was so bad we knew 
something was real w rong. But 
we have no automobile, and 
It was after 9 before we got 
a neighbor to take us all to 
the hospital. 

“We stayed with Pauline 
awhile, and then went home. 
At 2 o’clock, a neighbor gave 
us a telephone message that 
Pauline was going to be op- 
erated on. 

“I went to the church and lit 
some candles. Then I went to 
the hospital. I had to wait for 
a long time, and finally a doc- 
tor came out and said he was 
sorry — Pauline had just passed 
away. He said he didn’t know 
why. 

“He wanted me to sign some 
papers, but 1 didn’t know what 
they were and I wouldn’t sign 
them. 



Pauline Estrada’s “wrong 
bottle” death brought into the 
limelight again last night the 
tragically similar deaths of two 
other General Hospital patients 
through staff negligence. 

Still dragging its way through 
the courts is a lawsuit resulting 
from the death of Mrs. Belen C. 
Mendoza, 43, on Armistice Day, 
1944. 

The other glaring example of 
gross carelessness was the death 
of Mrs. Mary Clifton, Pomona 
widow, in 1941, which resulted in 
an award of $15,000 to her two 
sons. 



MOTHER OF 11 



Mrs. Mendoza, mother of 11 
children, was brought to the hos- 
pital for treatment for high 
blood pressure. 

She was to have been adminis- 
tered 20 c. c.’s of 10 per cent solu- 
tion of magnesium sulphate. 

Instead, a saturated solution 
of abdut 66 per cent was admin- 
istered. 

A Coroner’s jury found it was 
administered accidentally by Dr. 
Richard K. Schaeffer and that it 
was “due to negligence on the 
part of Dr. Schaeffer and to in- 
experience on the part of the 
student nurse, Miss Margaret 
Elizabeth Moore.”

made public. 

In Mrs. Clifton’s case a Coro- 
ner’s jury recommended that 
“the proper authorities at the 
hospital be instructed to Im- 
prove the system of labeling 
and segregation of poisonous 
substances.” 

Mrs. Clifton, only 38, had been 
brought to the hospital so doc- 
tors could attempt to determine 
why she was suffering from 
headaches. 

A blood sugar tolerance test, 
requiring injection of glucose, 
was ordered. 

The nurse testified she ob- 
tained a bottle labeled glucose, 
but the evidence showed Mrs. 
Clifton died from a lethal dose 
of urea cyanide. 

Although the District Attor- 
ney’s office and General Hospital 
officials inaugurated an investi- 
gation to determine how cyanide 
got into a bottle bearing a glu- 
cose label, nothing ever came of 
either probe.

WENT HOME- 



At the inquest, Dr. Schaeffer 
said he had asked Miss Moore to 
prepare the prescribed solution, 
that he paid litlle attention to 
her as she obtained the mag- 
nesium sulphate, because he was 
having a conversation with an 
other doctor. 

“I was not cognizant of the 
nurse’s movement at the time,” 
he related. “I don’t recall see- 
ing the bottle. I don’t recall 
any 10 per cent solution label.” 
Miss Moore, admittedly “un- 
familiar with solutions,” said she 
found a large bottle marked 
magnesium sulphate. That’s all 
there was to it. But she also said 
It was her responsibility “to fill 
the order correctly and it was

AMERICA, LAND OF PROMISE 




On October 12 our country observed the four hundred fifty- 
third anniversary of the discovery of America! 

For centures prior to that event the peoples of Europe had 
groaned beneath the yoke of intellectual, political and religious 
tyranny, and In the great plan of God it was time for “a new 
order of things.” 

Though he knew not the magnitude of his remarkable dis- 
covery, yet it is evident that Christopher Columbus was divinely 
led to unveil a new world in which the persecuted and oppressed 
might find a refuse. 

In the colonial life of America, what vast and far-reaching 
influence was exerted by such noble, freedom-loving spirits a* 
Roger Williams and William Penn! And in the building of a 
nation, what a debt we owe to such founding fathers as Wash- 
ington, Franklin and Jefferson! 

They asserted that if every prince since Nimrod had been a 
tyrant, it would still be a crime to tyrannize; that men should 
render unto Caesar only that which is Caesar’s, and that the 
citadel of conscience, the home of reason, should never he 
invaded. , 

It is highly significant that the old state-house bell In Phila- 
delphia that pealed forth the message of freedom, bears upon 
Us surface the immortal words of SerTntme: 

“Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land Unto All the 
Inhabitants Thereof." Leviticus 25:10. 

“Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" were the watch- 
words. and marvelous were the results! 

Tn no other nation were tho foundation principles of justice, 
righteousness and truth so firmly established. 

No other nation in so limited a time developed such unlimited 
resources. 

No other nation in so quiet and peaceful a manner ever 
arose so rapidly to such a pinnacle of powcj-. 

In no other nation or era have such signal successes been 
achieved in the arts and sciences, both of peace and of war. 

Most wonderful of all. In this promised lend of mire, un- 
fettered religion of Christ became so firmly established that from 
ihls cradle of liberty the gospel message was to radiate with 
blessing and uniift to many people and nations. 

“This is the Lord’s dolng^and It Is marvelous In our eyes."

Plan to Withdraw 

(Continued From Page One) 

Bataan, I went up to Binalonan believing 
that Bfigadier General Clyde A. Selleck, 
the Tlst Division’s commander, would be 
there. 

BINALONAN LIES JUST EAST OF 
THE MAIN HIGHWAY. AN OLD AND 
RARELY USED ROAD RUNS MORE 
OR LESS PARALLEL TO THE MAIN 
HIGHWAY NORTHWARD AND LEADS 
INTO BINALONAN DIRECTLY. FOR 
SOME REASON OR OTHER I CHOSE 
THE OLD ROAD, AND BY DOING SO 
JUST MISSED BEING CAPTURED OR 
KILLED. . 

As I was nearing the town, a platoon 
of four or five tanks rode down the main 
highway about 200 yards to my left, going 
label o, s 0U th. They were Jap tanks. My dusty 
Diner phot*, Packard sedan' would have offered small 
iL resistance to them if I had encountered 
them head-on, on the main road. 

V 7I( I got into the village aware that at 
c yesterd; least some elements of the enemy were now 
ty tota ' between me and Bataan, but could not find 

>mparpd 

od in m. General Selleck. Nor could I find any 
71st Division troops. 

ji„ j] * 

>nue, b But the 26tli Cavalry was there, with 
little Colonel Pierce right out in the thick 
of furiousicombat with the vanguard of the 
ither, ve main Jap fo pee. The 26th had been in action 
h S< Day a since daylight, protecting the retreat of the. 
r. vearie 7lst to the Agno. By the time I reached it, 
°ontTf h ^ ie 26th was reduced to not more than 450 
men.

Vital Bridge Gone 

I ordered Pierce to get his truck train 
and his wounded men out as quickly as pos- 
sible and hold his position as long as he 
safely could and still be able to withdraw 
liis remaining men. When the time came 
to withdraw, he would back up to the Agno, 
15 miles below him, cross the bridge, 
destroy it and hold the south side of the 
river. 

PIERCE HELD THAT POSITION 
AT BINALONAN AGAINST OVER- 
WHELMING ODDS UNTIL 3:30 ON THE 
AFTERNOON OF DECEMBER 24, BY 
WHICH TIME HE HAD FORCED THE 
JAPS TO DEPLOY THE ADVANCE 
GUARD OF THEIR MAIN COLUMN 
AND TO BEGIN THE DEPLOYMENT 
OF THE WHOLE MAIN ASSAULT 
BODY. 

Here was true cavalry delaying action, 
fit to make a man’s heart sing. Pierce that 
day upheld the best traditions of the cav- 
alry service, and liis action led to his being 
raised to the rank of brigadier general. 

I stayed at Binalongn with him for two 
nner or three hours and then returned to my 
Alcala headquarters. Eli route I passed 
along the south bank of the Agno and as I 
crossed the main north-south highway at 
Carmen I noted. that Jap planes had 
bombed the mile-long bridge over the Agno 
between Carmen .and Villasis. They had 
destroyed the south span of the vital bridge, 
blowing it off its abutment. 

It was a time for cursing our luck , 
because the 11th Division would have to 
cross that bridge on the night of December 
24-25 in its withdrawal southward. 

But while I was standing there, view- 
ing the damage, Colonel Skerry, my engi- 
neer chief, loomed out of nowhere. He was

CHRISTMAS WD SIC WS- 

Some of General Wainwright’* weary fighters shared 
a can of beans for their Christmas, 1941, dinner, but 
much-needed clgarcts help bring smiles to the fight- 
ers’ faces. General Wainwright tells of the mounting 
scarcity of food as the battle grows more intense.

already making plans for temporary repair 
of the bridge. At the same time he was 
having charges placed under the undam- 
aged part of the bridge so he would be 
ready to blow it as soon as the lltli got 
across, or blow it if the Japs got to the river 
before the lltli did. 

From that point I got in touch with my 
Alcala headquarters and ordered it moved 
hack to Bamban, a short distance south of 
Stotsenburg. I told my operations officer, 
my signal officer ail’d a few enlisted men 
to wait at Alcala for me. 

I reached Alcala on the evening of 
December 24. Christmas Eve always was 
something of an event around our home in 
the good days, and now I found my 
mind going hack over those memories of a 
Christmas tree, the arrangement of our 
boy’s toys, the carefully wrapped packages 
for my wife, and all the things that go with 
a family on that night. 

So 1 got in touch by phone with Necker 
at R. C. A. in Manila. He was closing up. 
The city had been declared* an open one. 
But he was kind enough to get through a 
message to Adele. 

I remember it because it was the last 
time I was able to wireless her directly for 
three awful years. 

9 

I was hot, dirty and hungry from the 
day’s fighting, worrying and traveling. 
But the food which my headquarters com- 
mandant was supposed to send up from 
Bamban upon his arrival there failed to 
come. We went to bed that night without 
dinner. 

Christmas — and Beans 

On Christmas morning, 1941, a tank 
officer came past my skeletonized head- 
quarters and gave us a Christmas present. 
It was a can of beans. Our little force, in- 
cluding Colonels Frank Nelson and Josh 
Stansell, split it up. It was Christmas 
breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as our 
Christmas Eve dinner — and was mightily 
appreciated.

Measures Reported to Include 

Reducing Status of Emperor 

-- 1 • 

By Howard Handleman 

• t«»f Corr.ipontJ.nt International »... $ar>lc* 

TOKYO, Oct. 13 (Satur- 
day). — Japanese authorities took 
a i series of major steps today to 
dqmocratize Japan, including re- 
ported measures to reduce the 
Emperor to the status of a con- 
stitutional monarch. 

General Douglas Mac Arthur’s 
headquarters announced also that 
Russian, Chinese and British 
troops will take part in the occu- 
pation of Japan, but the numbers 
involved have not yet been de- 
cided. 

A headquarters spokesman said 
the number, date of their arrival I 
and the areas they are to occupy 



Reports are that midget cars are going to be the thing 
In a few months. One job has got ;hree silver handles on each 
side. That’s so when a hig car hits you, they can just close 
down the lid and head straight for the grave. 

The finance company is ready for the small jobs. They've 
hired a tribe of African Pygmies just to repossess them. If 
you miss two payments, they’re going to stand at Hollywood 
and Vine and bring you down with a blow -gun. 

There will be “hugs,” of course, In the new models . . , 
In fact, three good-sized bugs are about all It will hold. 

And they’re not going to have any tops. If It rains, you’re 
supposed to Just pull your hat down over the wheels. 

One fellow was tearing through traffic the other day in 
one of the new models when he hit an open manhole. He 
became suddenly Immortal as the first person ever to go

No comment was offered as to 
the effect that four-power occu- 
pation may have on Mac Arthur’s 
position as supreme Allied com- 
mander, although advices from] 
Washington indicated continued 
United States opposition to joint 
control in Nippon. 

HASTEN REFORMS— 

Action taken by the Govern- 
ment to hasten the execution of 
history- making reforms ordered 
by General Mac Arthur included: 

1. Hundreds of secret police 
were dismissed. 

2. The home ministry an- 

nounced that all political forces 
now are free to organize and 
campaign. , * 

3. Plans were set under way 
for women to vote in Diet elec- 
tions in January. 

4. The navy ministry informed 
MacArthur that the home naval 
and air fleet headquarters have 
been disbanded. 

5. The . propagandist D o m e i

solved.

Boasts 
Beheading 

TOKYO. Oct. 13 (Satur- 
day).— (A*) — A Japanese naval 
Interpreter who boasted in a 
diary he beheaded an Allied pris- 
oner la in an Australian prison 
and missionaries accuse him of 
participating in the killing of four 
American aviators in another 
case. The details were disclosed 
here today. 

The Japanese, Kenneth Yunone, 
was captured April 25. 1944, at 
Hollandia, Dutch New Guinea. 

The diary’ boasted under the 
date “24 October” (presumably 
19431 that he beheaded an Allied 
prisoner that day while Japanese 
onlookers “declared their admir- 
ation for my skill In making such 
an excellent stroke." 

The Japanese was identified by 
six repatriated missionaries who 
knew him at the time of the be- 
heading.

WIESBADEY. G er 

many, Oct. 12. — General Dwight 
D. Eisenhower tonight reacted 
sharply to criticisms against the 
United States Army’s policy of 
de-Nazification in Germany — the 
alleged reason for General 
George S. Patton’s relegation to 
command of a “paper army.’’ 

“We are doing our damnedest 
to follow the Potsdam declara- 
tions,” General Elsenhower said 
in an unusually frank state- 
ment. 

“Any man In my army who 
Is not doing his job with heart . 
and hand will be put out. 

“I wouldn't stay here five 
more minutes If I didn’t deeply 
believe we were fulfilling the 
job we are here to do.” 

General Eisenhower said that 
some persons in America “are 
under the impression that we 
have no policy in the occupation 
of Germany. 

“Our policy, I want to make 
clear. Is the Potsdam declara- 
tion,” he emphasized. 

“W> are here to make sure 
that Germany won't make war 
again In our time. It Is going 
to take at least 50 years to re- 
educate the Germans. 

“W’e will probably never be 
able to reeducate the Nazis.” 

SNIPING HIT 



Ex-Red Editor 
Plans 'Showup' 
of Communism 



SOUTH BEND, Ind., Oct. 12. 

— (INS) — Louis F. Budcnz, for- 
mer managing editor of the Com- 
munist newspaper, Daily Worker, 
who severed his political connec- 
tions to return to the Catholic 
Church, said today he will “show 
up” Communism. 

The 57-year-old Budenz, now a 
member of the faculty at the 
University of Notre Dame, de- 
clared: 

“I will show up Communism 
In theory and practice In the 
classroom, but it will take a 

few months to organize myself, JT'iniM 

I have a personal religious ^LfUrLtxAIItJli 

problem and have to get myself 
together. 

“I will oppose Communism in 
a definite and. I hope, effective 
way, but will not engage in 
personal attacks on Com- 
munists. There will be no name 
calling.” 

Budenz will assume his teach- 
ing post November 5 as assistant 
professor of economics. He will 
conduct a class in labor relations. 



General Eisenhower said that 
there had been “sniping at us as 
if our motives weren’t those 
which were laid down at Berlin.”

In Ufe,” he added. “The first Is 
to take care of my men and the 
second Is to fulfill the Potsdam 
declaration. 

“We are going to feed the 
Germans 1500 calories a day to 
keep them from starving, hut 
we are not going to pamper 
them. 

“We will ^get through the 
winter without a general up- 
rising, but by spring this will 
he a nation of shrunken stom- 
achs.” 



Class System and Privileges 
in Russia, Rep. Mundt Says 



PARIS. Oct. 12. — CY) — 
Representative Karl E. Mundt 
(Republican), South Dakota, 
said today that a class system 
has evolved in Russia with “all 
kinds of special privilege” for 
certain classes, and that “the 
old one-for-all and all-for-one 
Idea has been drowned in the 
Volga.” 

Stopping here with Representa- 
tive Frances P. Bolton (Republi- 
can), Ohio, after a tour of 20 
European and Near East coun- 
tries, Mundt also told a press 
conference that he and Mrs. Bol- 
ton would take back to Congress 
these findings on their trip: 

1. That French troops used. 
lend-Iease arms from the 
United State* to quell the 

Lebanese. 

2. That if Yugoslavia holds 
November elections as sched- 
uled. “It will not be an election 
hut a political parade." 



3. That British and Ameri 
can representatives in Hangary 
are only observers to Russia’s 
unilateral control there. 

They said they would recom- 
mend that In the future any pro- 
tected territories be placed under 
a joint mandate of the five 
major powers, not under a single 
nation: and that administration 
of occupied zones likewise be 
under five-power control rather 
than separate “pie-slice” juris- 
diction. 

Describing his visit to Rus- 
sia, Mundt said “the military 
and government classes have 
special privilege far beyond 
those of any of these classes 
In any capitalist country' In the 
world.” 

He said he learned that many 
persons in the military and gov- 
ernment classes were not re- 
quired to pay income taxes and 
that even ration cards, regulat- 



Truman Hits 
DAR Action 

WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 — 
(INS) — President Truman de- 
clined to interfere today in the 
decision by the Daughters of the 
American Revolution to exclude 
Hazel Scott, Negro pianist, from 
Constitution Hall in the nation’s 
capital. 

The President took the occa- 
sion, however, to voice a strong 
criticism of racial discrimination. 

He sent a telegram to Repre- 
sentative Powell (Democrat), 
New York, the pianist’s husband, 
stating he could not interfere in 
the conduct of a private enter- 
prise such as the D. A. R. 

In the message, however, Mr. 
Truman said that artistic talent 
was not the exclusive property 
of any one group or race, and 
that racial discrimination was 
one of the first steps used by 
the Nazis to whip up hatred and 
bring on World War II. 

The President’s telegram was 
ih answer to messages he had 
received protesting the D. A. R.’s 
action. Mrs. Truman is an honor- 
ary member of the .D. A. R.’s 
chapter at Independence, Mo., 
the President’s home. 

The D. A. R.. meanw'hile, stood 
firm on its rule barring Negro 
artists from 'Constitutional Hall, 
the society's Washington audi- 
torium.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 12.-Im- 
mediate establishment of a U. S. 1 
Department of National Defense; 
was urged tonight by General 
George C. Kenney. 

Earlier, General Kenney con-, 
ferred with President Truman at 
the White House. General George 
C. Marshall, Army chief of staff, 
accompanied the air commander. 

LAVDS M’ ARTHUR — 

First top member of the Mac- 
Arthur team to return to Wash- 
ington since the capitulation of 
Japan, General Kenney said Gerl- 
eral MacArthur had employed j 
“the whole outlines of a national 
defense 'department throughout 
the war with marked success.” 
He added: 

“I think It is a scheme we 
had better study carefully and 
adopt immediately.” 

Under the MacArthur plan, 
Kenney explained, air, lancKand 
sea commanders had co-equality 
with MacArthur as the final de- 
ciding authority. 

“The Rystem was simple and 
It worked,” Kenney said. “We 
won the war. MacArthur has 
had a department of national 
defense, or offense, ever since 
he took supreme command In 
Australia. It’s the best and the 
most economical way of fight- 
ing a war — or keeping a peace.”

Kenney declared that although 
bombs had won the war against 
Japan, integration and coopera- 
tion among the three services 
under MacArthur’s over-all com- 
mand had been the first basic 
factor of victory. 

“The air forces blasted a 
path for Invasion troops, held 
supreme control 9f the skies 
and kept the foe isolated and 
blockaded wherever we hit 
him,” Kenney said. 

“Then It was up to the Navy 
to get our troops to the 
beaches and up to the troops 
themselves to capitalize on 
gains and capitalize swiftly.”

Blowing Bridge 
Cuts Off Japs 

(Continued From Page Six) 

FIVE PHASES, DESIGNATED AS Dl, 
D2, D3, D4 AND D5. 

Dl called for a withdrawal to a line 
along Urdaneta, San Carlos and Aguilar, 
about midway between the base of Lin- 

s. v 

gaven Gulf and the Agno. D2 was a line 
behind the Agno. D3 reached from San 
Jose to Santa Ignacio and ran through 
Gerona, 16 miles farther south. D4 reached 
from Cabantuan through Zaragosa, La Paz 
and Tarlac to the high ground west of Tar- 

lac. D5 stretched across the broad valley 

. »' * 

leading down from Lingayen Gulf from 
feamban on the west to Sibul Springs at the 
foot of the mountains to the east. 



IT WAS UNLIKE ANY OF THE 
TEXTBOOK RETREATS I HAD 
'['X; STUDIED AT THE WAR COLLEGE 
AND AT LEAVENWORTH. IT DIF- 
IAW FERED FROM THE RETREAT OF 
IAVV GENERAL McDOWELL’S ARMY 
“* r ” * FROM THE FIRST BATTLE OF BULL 
c-r- ' RUN IN THAT THAT HAD BEEN A 
* ROUT. NOR WAS IT LIKE POPE’S 

retreat after the second 

’ rc: BATTLE OF BULL RUN, OR LEE’S 
itM™- WITHDRAWAL FROM GETTYSBURG. 

In these classic retreats the object was 
Westlai away from the enemy by speed of 

3w , EaiH movement. Moving down toward Bataan 
•• Br#4 we had the definite mission of delaying 
c ,~ kto tm l T ’ll 16 enemy as long as practicable, not only 
KfjSd t° permit General Jones’ South Luzon 
ij»»^ force to clear around Manila Bay and get 
into Bataan, but also to enable Major Gen- 
itJeliiV., eral (George M. Parker to prepare our 
Bataan defenses for us. Ours was more 
S’rtTi- withdrawal than retreat, withdrawal with 
Hoc delaying actions all the way. But even 
". 7 o 5 m, *, tliat hurt deeply. It was hard for an Amer- 
ican to get used to.

Withdrawal to Line Dl was to be com- 
pleted on the night of December 23-24; D2 
on the night of December 24-25; D3 the 
next night; D4 the night of the 27tli-28th 
and D5 two nights later, the last two with- 
drawals subject to cancellation in case we 
could hold those D4 and D5 lines. 

We completed withdrawals Dl, D2 and 
D3 without incident, but the Japs hit us 
heavily at D4, especially at Cabanatuan on 
our right flank. 

The 91st Division took the brunt of the 
Jap tanks, cavalry and infantry, and gave 
ground to Capan, 10 miles south of 
Cabanatuan. 

Late the same evening , December 
29, the 91st was attacked again and was 
routed. Our buses, loaded to their ceil- 
ings, hauled the survivors 20 miles farther 
south , where the division commander ral- 
lied what was left of his force . 

My right flank was in such. peril that 
I immediately ordered a general with- 
drawal to D5, the Bamban line, on the 
night of December 30-31. That night Bon- 
nett and about 1000 troops of the 12th and 
13th Infantry Regiments, trapped up the 
Ken non Road two weeks before, rejoined 
us and were placed with the 11th Division 
along the D5 line. 

The 91st was reformed east and south 
of the Pampanga River, but for some 
reason which I’ve never been able to 
fathom MacArthur’s headquarters directed 
that I was not to employ the 91st’s artillery 
units. I therewith ordered the 91st’s artil- 
lery to withdraw at once to Bataan.

WHICH IT COULD TRAVEL TO 
BATAAN, HAD TO CROSS THE PAM- 
PANGA RIVER BY MEANS OF THE 
CALUMPIT BRID.GE TO REACH SAN 
FERNANDO PAMPANGA AND THE 
HOMESTRETCH OF THE ESCAPE 
ROAD TO BATAAN. THE BRIDGE 
WAS A SERIOUS BOTTLENECK. THE 
JAPS KNEW IT AND STARTED FOR 
IT, BENT UPON TRAPPING A LARGE 
PART OF THE SOUTH LUZON FORCE. 

We had to protect that bridge, and 
San Fernando Pampanga. With the 500 
men left of the 91st Division, plus a regi- 
ment of the 71st Division and a battalion 
of field artillery, I took a position along the 
Pampanga River north of Baliaug at 11 
o’clock on the night of December 30, while 
the South Luzon force inbved as quickly as 
possible, over the bridge and through San 
Fernando Pampanga. During the night a 
company of the 192nd Tank Battalion was 
added to this defense. 

Dreary NewYear 

At 10:30 on the morning of December 
31 the Japs attacked. The 91st, somewhat 
reinforced, held its position all day in sharp 
fighting, while General Jones’ South Luzon 
men rail what amounted to a gauntlet. By 
midnight the majority of General Jones’ 
men were safely through San Fernando 
Pampanga, protected by the successful 
stand of the 11th and 21st Divisions north 
of the town. 

I WELCOMED IN THE DREARY 
NEW YEAR OF 1942, WHICH WAS TO 
SEE US FALL AND BECOME THE VIC- 
TIMS OF BARBAROUS CAPTIVITY, 
BY ORDERING THE PLUCKY 91ST TO 
BEGIN ITS OWN WITHDRAWAL 
OVER THE CALUMPIT BRIDGE AND 



commercial buses. This was a common scene as tKe 
overwhelming weight of the Japanese invaders whit- 
tled away at the heroic defenders. “It was a time 



for cursing our luck,” said General Wainwright, 
but the defenders carried on in the face of some of 
the worst odds ever confronting an army.

this escape bridge, and blowing it would 
cut them off. 



I was at the bridge at dawn as the last 
elements of the 91st Division crossed. The 
last truck, one of the civilian ones I had 
earlier commandeered, stopped at the edge 
of the bridge and reported to me that it had 
been fired upon by a Japanese patrol at a 
crossroad about 500 yards away. I ad- 
justed my field glasses and in the early 
light of the morning I could see the enemy 
patrol, the tip of the Jap advance guard, 
coming at us. 

“Blow it,” I told Colonel Skerry. 

But he hesitated, and then informed 
me that Major Manzano, of the 14th Engi- 
neers, a fine Philippine Scout officer, and a 
platoon of fellow engineers were still exe- 
cuting demolitions between Manila and 



I looked again at the approaching 
Japs, and had to choose. 

“Blow it now,” I repeated. It was 
just 6:15 a. m. 

The bridge came down into the river 
with a deafening roar and the Jap force

Mexico City 



By Princess Conchita

MEXICO CITY BOUND on a 
honeymooning are the former 
Jams Nordling, daughter of Mr. 
and Mrs. A. B. Nordling, and 
Lieutenant Commander Francis 
Henry McGee, U. S. N., son of 
Mrs. Edith McGee. 

The romancers exchanged their 
nuptial vows in an impressive 
ceremony yesterday afternoon in 
Shatto Chapel of the First Con- 
gregational Church, with the 
Rev. James W. Fifield Jr. pre- 
siding. 

Entering on the arm of her 
father, the bride wore a beauti- 
ful gown of white velvet, with a 
bouffant skirt and a long train. 
Her full-length tulle veil fell 
from a Juliet cap and she carried 
a nosegay of white orchids. 

Mrs. Edward H. Eakland Jr. 
attended her sister as matron of j 
honor. The bridegroom’s brother. 
John \V. McGee, served as best 
man and ushers were Lieutenant ! 
Commanders R. C. LeFever and 

Louis C. Knox.

TO LOUELLA PARSONS goes 
the distinction of hostessing the 
smartest and most 
party of the postwar social 
son in filmdom. 

As the first hostess of Holly- 
wood, the gracious Louella is par 
excellence and she looked exceed- 
ingly chic as she received her 
guests in the rose-bedecked ter- 
raced garden. Her black after- 
noon gown featured long lines 
and a dash of color in a Roman 
striped ribbon tied in a lovers’ 
knot at the shoulder. 

Doctor Harry Martin received 
a jovial reception from his many 
friends when he arrived for a 
festive respite from the hospital 
where he is recovering from 
dengue fever. 

A brief chat with the guest of 
honor, George Dela<jorte, proved

a pistol which shot a member of 
her family, and for a while she 
didn’t know whether to continue 
speaking to its present owner. It 
was the weapon which wounded 
Wiliam Clark Quantrill, Confed-

Kan., in the late 60’s. Quantrill 
was Evelyn’s distant relative. The 
gun was fired by Andrew Jackson

today is the property of his
