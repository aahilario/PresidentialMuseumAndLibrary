rovfrsial legislation also is slat*

Ion expires. 

After the House speedily

<lte tacked on some amendments

lever had a chance to vote on ft 
ind refused to allow the bill to

mce they would get a chance to

They have announced they will 
move to Instruct the conferees 
o nretaln the Senate amendment 
and claim they have enough 
votes to win their point. But 
Speaker Sam Rayburn gave no- 
tice that he would not recognize 
a motion for that purpose before 
Friday. 

Deferring the final decision un- 
til after the elections is believed 
by opponents of the Senate pro- 
vision to have strengthened their 
hand. They took the view that 
some of the members up lor re- 
election might hesitate to oppose 
such a proposal before elections 
but that returning members iust 
re-elected for two years might 
not be so apprehensive of pos- 
sible political consequences. 

Farm Workers. 

Much less controversial are 
two other Senate changes. One 
stipulates irreplaceable farm 
workers shall be dclerfed from 
induction as long as they stay 
on the farms or until suitable 
replacements can be obtained. 
The other provides that regis- 
trants who have passed their 
45th birthdays shall not be in-

shall have the points of bayonets

against all enemies our liberty 
and rights, we must win, we will 
win, the victory. 

To do so unity and sacrifice are 
needed. A house divided against 
itself will fall; and, therefore, our 
nation must not be divided 
against itself as far as the war 
is concerned. To win the victory 
our entire people, like a single 
unit, must fight shoulder to shoul- 
der under our Commander-In- 
Chiet Such a course is dictated 
not only by reason, but also by 
revelation, for It has been said: 
“Let every soul be subject to high- 
er powers: for there is no power 
but from God: and those that 
are, are ordained of God.” 

Sacrifice Necessary. 

We must sacrifice private Inter- 
ests in behalf of the common 
good. No matter how hard the 
task may be, we will perform it 
without flinching! We will not 
complain if the struggle be pro- 
longed, or costly; nor if it strikes 
home to us by lessening luxury 
and depleting coffers; or even by 
the death of those that are dear 
to us. We are resolved to meet, 
with God's help, every danger; 
to overcome every obstacle, and 
to vanquish every foe. 

In order that the shame of de- 
feat may not be handed down by 
us to future generations of this 
country, we will never yield to 
the greed, the treachery, the 
cruelty of our foes. 

“Hope of Our Nation.” 

As the radio carries my voice 
to the ends of the earth, I gladly 
send a greeting to our military 
forces on land, on sea, in the air 
wherever they may be, whether at 
home or abroad. You, our fellow 
Americans under arms, are the 
hope of our nation. You wage 
war, not to rob other peoples of 
home and fatherland, but to de- 
fend your owTi land and homes; 
you fight for the preservation of 
the freedom handed down to us 
by our forefathers; you risk your 
lives in the sacred cause of re- 
ligion and civilization. 

You are ever in our minds and 

hearts and are remembered In 
our prayers. In* your dangers 
and sufferings you have our sym- 
pathy. We feel sure that in time 
to come the children of America 
will read in their school books 
the story of your valorous deeds 
and glorious triumphs; as we, 
when young, read in our text- 
books of Bunker Hill, Saratoga 
Heights and Valley Forge. We 
pray that in every battle with our 
enemies, God’s protecting hand 
may be stretched over you.

WABHINGTON, Nov. 15— Arch- 
bishop Francis J. Spellman of New 
York oflfclated today at a com- 
J memorative diplomatic mass at St. 
Aloysius Church In honor of the 
seventh anniversary of tho Philip- 
pine Commonwealth. 

The ceremony was dedicated to 
the memory of the American and 
Filipino soldiers who died during 
General Douglas MacArthur's 
struggle to defend the territory 
and Democratic institutions of the 
Commonwealth against the Japa- 



nese. 



.i. 



The special memorial sermon of 
tho Very Rev. Robert I. Gannon, 
president of Fordham University, 
said it was because **they loved 
everything that wc love and hated 
what the Japanese admired they 
fought and died like heroes in the 
foxholes of Bataan." 

They were "patriots fighting 
fanatics, human being fighting 
beasts," said Father Gannon. 
"They were not taking the lives 
of others under the delusion that 
Haven is to be won by slaughter. 

Fought to Protect Home* 



Friends of the United Nations: 

Though the alien flag of a 
treacherous aggressor flies tem- 
porarily over the Commonwealth 
of the Philippines, it is with su- 
preme confidence In ultimate vic- 
tory that the United Nations 
commemorate this birthday of its 
youngest member. 

It was Just seven years ago that 
this Commonwealth was estab- 
lished. By that time the United 
States had maintained sovereign- 
ty of the Philippine Islands for 
more than thirty years. But, as 
I said in 1935, when the present 
Commonwealth was Inaugurated, 
"the acceptance of sovereignty 
was but an obligation to servo the 
people of the Philippines until the 
day they might find themaelves 
independent and take their own 
place among the nationa of the 
world." 

Let me go 'back to the days 
when Admiral Dewey won the 
Battle of Manila Bay and Amer- 
ican sovereignty was established 
over the islands. To a very large 
part of the American people it 
seemed Incongruous and unwise 
that the United States should con- 
tinue permanently a colonial 
status over many millions of hu- 
man beings who had already 
shown a desire for Independence. 




President Manuel L. Quezon 



Gradual Process Followed 




They were battling toe to toe 
with a powerful invader to pro- 
tect thoir homes and their pure 
and beautiful Christian woman- 
hood; to protect their schools, their 
churches, their inalienable rights; 
their dignity as men; their way of 
life — our way of life. 

"Wo salute today with the deep- 
est reverence the 02,000 or more 
brave young Filipinos who with 
14,000 equally brave American 
boys kept a reckless enemy at bay 
for four long, desperate months, 
Rick and hungry, strafed and 
bombed, with no help from the air 
or from the sea, 

"We bow our heads in grateful 



However, the United States and 
the leaders of the Philippine peo- 
ple soon undertook a long-time 
process of providing facilities in 
the islands for education and 
health and commerce and trans- 
portation, with the definite 
thought that the day would come 
when the people w’ould be able to 
stand on their own feet. And at 
the same time we granted them 
a greater and greater degree of 
locap self-government. 

By the year 1934 sympathetic 
conferences between Philippine 
and American leaders reached 
the conclusion that the time for 
complete independence could be 
definitely set, to follow a ten-year 
period of complete local auton- 
omy under a commonwealth 
form of government with its own 
Constitution. 

This status was duly set up in 
1935 under the Presidency of my 
old friend, Manuel Quezon. It 
succeeded so well that by Dec. 
7, 1941, we were jointly at work 
preparing for the consummation 
of complete independence in 1946. 
Both nations and peoples had 
kept faith with each other during 
all those years. Confidence in 



each other's good faith was firm- 
ly established— and It was cement- 
ed into place during the bitter 
months of ordeal which followed 
the treachery of Japan. 

The brave peoples of the Phil- 
ippines— their army and their cl- 
vlllans— stood shoulder to shoul- 
der with the Americans in the 
fight against overwhelming odds, 
resolute to shed their blood in 
defense of their liberty. Richly 
do they deserve that liberty! 



"Pattern for the Future" 



I like to think that the history 
of the Philippine Islands in the 
last forty-four years provides In 
a very real sense a pattern for 
the future of other small nations 
and peoples of the world. It is 
a pattom of what men of good- 
will look foi^vard to in the future 
—a pattern of a global civiliza- 
tion which* recognizes no limita- 
tions of religion, of creed or of 
race. 

But we must remember that 
such a pattern is based on two 
important factors. The first is 
that there shall be a period of 
preparation, through the dissem- 
ination of education and the rec- 
ognition and fulfillment of phys- 
ical and social and economic 
needs. Tho second is that there 
be a period of training for ulti- 
mate independent sovereignty.

"For in that one glorious cam-

"At any other time." he said,

"Their courage and sacrifices

The National Tuberculosis Asso- 
ciation reported yesterday an in- 
crease in deaths from tuberculosis 



in several 'European countries, 
Canada and China. 



In England and Wales deaths 
from tuberculosis rose 12 per cent 

between 1639 and 1941, the asso- 
ciation said. This increase was 
twice as high as that between 1914

and 1916.

R tistical officer for England and 
Wales, was quoted as saying that 
much of the rise undoubtedly was 
because of the closing of tubercu- 
losis hospitals m the early days 
of the present war. 

In Scotland between 1939 and 
1941 tuberculosis deaths increased 
18 per cent. In Paris deaths from 
tho disease rose 10 per cent in the 
first six months of 1941 over the 
^ first half of 1939. More deaths in 
Greece and Germany also were 
f reported. 



The three Presidential speeches, 
heard in this ePuntry and Mexico 
over the four major networks and 
sent by short-wave all over the 
world, were also listened to by 
about 600 leaders of the United Na- 
tions assembled here to hear Presi- 
dent Quezon make his address in 
person. 

Recalling the history of Ameri- 
can relations with the Philippines 
after their seizure from Spain in 
1898, Mr. Roosevelt said they "pro- 
vided a pattern of what men of 
good-will look forward to in the 
future — a pattern of global civili- 
zation which recognizes no limita- 
tions of religion or of creed or of 
race." Under this pattern, accord- 
ing to Congreasional action taken 
seven years ago, the Philippines are 
to become w'holly independent in 
1946. 

But such a pattern, he added, 
must be based on two important 
factors — first a period of improve- 
ment of the physical and economic 
status of tho peoples 'involved, and, 
second a period of training of them 
for ultimate independence through 
the practice of more and more self- 
government, beginning with local 
government and up through the 



various steps to complete state- 
hood. 

This was the same pattern fol- 
lowed by the United States before 
it attained its own independence, 
President Roosevelt recalled, add- 
ing that such training was "essen- 
tial to the stability of independ- 
ence in almost every part of the 
world." 

"Some peoples need more Inten* 
slve training and longer years," he 
said, "others require far less train- 
■Dig and*[a shorter ^riod of time.” 

The contrary theory of our en- 
emies — that there is one master 
folk destined to rule all others — "Is 
a doctrine nbw on its way to de- 
struction for all time to come," he 
declared. 



Quezon Recalls the Fight 



Mr. Quezon made a closely col- 
lateral point. 

Japan, he said, had waged this 
war under the delusion that all peo- 
ples in the so-called Greater Asia 
would accept her suzerainty, but 
learned in the Philippines, "at no 
small cost," that they were mis- 
taken. 

Undoubtedly expecting to meet 
only a small American force of op- 
position tn the Philippines, he said, 
the Japanese instead found the en- 
tire Filipino .armed forces fighting 
with equal intensity alongside the 
Americans, aided by every other 
asset the Philippine Commonwealth 
had. 

The Filipino people stood side by 
side with the United States "of 
their own free will," he continued, 
because although President Roose- 
velt had the power to call the 
Philippine armed forces into serv- 
ice in case of war, he found this 
unnecessary and took no such ac- 
tion. Nevertheless, the Japanese 
found "the bulk of General MacAr- 
thur’s forces predominantly Fili- 
pinos," he added. 

"Our decision," Mr. Quezon 
said, "was the seasoned fruit of a 
wise and fair-minded policy, of the 
meeting of minds and the friendly 
w'orking out of problems that have 
characterized our association with 
this liberty-loving country. 

"We offer to the world the 
record of the Philippines as an 
answer to any one who would con- 
sider the Atlantic Charter illusory 
and impractical. It is a signpost 
for all mankind to read. It is the 
factual evidence of what can and 
should be done, everywhere and for 
every people. It points to a goal 
that can be reached, however long 
and hard the road may be." 

Mr. Quezon then told his audi- 
ence that because Filipinos were 
bound "to the great peoples of 
Latin-America" by "unbreakable

to complete^atafllhood. 

Even we the United States 
did not arrive at full national in- 
dependence until w'6 had gone 
through the preliminary stages. 



The tow'n meetings in the l^w 

site-. 



England colonies, and the 
ilar local organizations in other 
colonies, gradually led to county 
government and then to State 
government. That whole process 
of political training and develop- 
ment preceded the final forma- 
tion of our permanent Federal 
government in 1789. 

Such training for independence 
Is essential to the stability of in- 
dependence in almost every part 
of the world. Some peoples need 
more intensive training and longer 
years of it; others require far 
less training and shorter periods 
of time.

Filipino Cooperation Cited 



The recent history of the Phil- 
ippines has been one of national 
cooperation and adjustment and 
development. We are sure now, 
if ever w« doubted, that our gov- 
ernment in the United States 
chose the right and the honorable 
course. 

The pattern which was followed 
there is essentially a part and 
parcel of the philosophy and the 
ideals of the United Nations. The 
doctrine which controls the am- 
bitions and directs the ruthless- 
ness of our enemles—tbat there is 
one master folk destined to rule 
ail other peoples— is a doctrine 
now on its way to destruction 
for all time to come. 

The United States and the Phil- 
ippines are already engaged in 
examining the practical economic 
problems of the future — when 
President Quezon and his govern- 
ment are reestablished in the cap- 
ital of Manila. He and I, In con- 
ference last week, have agreed 
to set up a joint commission of 
our two countries, to study the 
economic situation which will 
face the nation which is soon to 
be, and to work out means of 
preserving its stability and above 
all. its security. 

This typifies, I think, the high- 
est form of good faith that exists 
wholeheartedly between our two 
governments. 

It does more than that. It is 
a realistic symbol of our grim 
determination and of our supreme 
confidence that we shall drive 
the Japanese army out of the 
Philippines— to the last man. 

President Quezon— on this aus- 
picious anniversary — I salute, 
through you, the people of tho 
Philippine Islands. I salute their 
courage. I salute their indepen- 
dence.

ties of history and Latin culture, 
and that this was particularly true 
of Mexico, he had Invited President 
Avila Camacho to speak over the 
radio. 

The latter also recalled thees 
ties. Praising Mr. Quezon’s leader- 
ship of the Filipinos, first as a 
revolutionary and later as a Gov- 
ernment official, when he "bravely 
resisted the treacherous Japanese 
aggression," President Avila (Xm- 
-acbo said: 

"We in America know from ex- 
perience that the best training for 
self-government is the acceptance 
of complete responsibilities, and we 
also know that small and large 
countries can live and prosper 
within that sphere of collabora- 
tion which will be the most im- 
portant product of this struggle 
waged by the United Nations. 

"Uplifted by their war efforts, 
the Philippine Islands will then be- 
come another nation among the 
free Republics of a new world. 
With full confidence in such am 
outcome. I express the intense de- 
sires of the Government and people 
of Mexico that the sufferings of 
the Philippine Commonweadth will 
be recompensed in the near future 
bythe definite triumph of our com- 
mon cause.”

WASHINGTON. Nov. 15— Pres- 
ident Manuel Quezon of the Philip- 
pine Commonwealth announced to- 
day the presentation of the Philip- 
pine patrol vessel Bataan to the 
United States Government. The 



boat was accepted by President 
Roosevelt and turned over at once 
to the Coast Guard for service. 

The vessel, formerly the yacht 
Limbas owned by J. M. Elizade, 
Philippine Resident Commissioner, 
has Filipino officers and crew, who 
have been enrolled in the Coast 
Guard Reserve. 

The Bataan was accepted for the 
Coast Guard by Vice Admiral Rus- 
sell R. Waesche, commandant. 

In his letter of presentation to 
President Roosevelt President Que- 
zon said: 



“On behalf of the Government of 
the Commonwealth of Philippines, 



it is my great pleasure to present 
the N. V. Bataan to the Govern- 



ment of the United States. I beg 
you to accept this vessel as a token 
of undying Filipino determination 
to fight under your command until 
the war is won. 

"The Filipino officers and crew 
who will man this vessel are now 
regular members of the United 
States Coast Guard Reserve. 

"They, and this Coast Guard 
patrol boat, represent the desire of 
every one of the seventeen million 
Filipinos, whether under enemy 
domination# or on free soil, to go 
into action again in the fight for 
freedom.” 

In the letter of acceptance Presi- 
dent Roosevelt wrote; 

"We stand with almost all the 
peoples in the world that love lib- 
erty and respect humanity against 
a few nations inspired by hatred, 
envy and atavistic fury. 

"The firmness and courage 
shown by the people and tho Army 
of the Philippines in this world- 
wide struggle are an inspiration to 
your present allies and will be a 
glory of your future history. 

"Your country has shed Its blood 
against this onrush. Your people 
are daily risking their lives and 
often losing them so that the way 
will be pased for your triumphal 
return. 

"You and your countrymen here 
have given up the homes and fam- 
ilies of your native land in order 
to pursue the fight.

cord with this spirit of sacrifice. It 
is accepted in the same spirit given 
since we of the United States are 
willing to give up our all, too. in 
order that the warmth of love nad 
peace may again be restored to the 
earth. 

"Finally, you and your people 
can rest assured that we will know 
how to re-establish that liberty 
which we founded. 

"I accept the Bataan in the name 
of our government and for our 
Coast Guard, not only as a token, 
but as a valuable aid in our com- 
mon effort. It is a symbol of our 
common purpose and our eternal 
friendship, and will be manned by

Back to Flrni Principles 



The stress of war inevitably brings a return to fund- 
amental values. Frills and furbelows disappear; 
only realities count. Thus the principles which 
Roger Kent atone has long practiced take on new 
significance. One price for suits and outercoats; 
cash only; no reduction sales ever! This intense 
specialization and economy now, as always, produce 
values no dunking man can afford to overlook.

CHICAQO. Nov. 14— Six Ger- 

man*Americans who have been on 
trial for three weeks on charge* 
of treason in aiding and sheltering 
Herbert Hans Haupt, the Nazi 
aaboteur who was executed with 
others after an Army trial, were 
found guilty tonight by a Jury In 
Federal court. 

The Jury, composed of eight wo- 
men and four men, deliberated 
three hours before reaching the 
verdict which ended the first trea- 
son trial in Illinois. ^ 

The defendants were Hans and 
Ema Haupt, parents of Herbert 
Haupt; Walter and Lucille Froeh- 
ling, his aunt and imcle, and Otto 
and Kate Wergin, friends of the 
Haupts and Froehlinga. 

Neither of the Haupts betrayed 
a sign of emotion. Froehling be- 
gan a violent trembling, and his 
wife, ’ho had maintained an icy 
calm throughout the trial, broke 
into sobs. Wergin sat Immobile, 
but Mrs. Wergin paled and trem- 
bled. Matrons were obliged to as- 
sist Mrs. Froehling from the court 
room. 

Hearing Is Set for Friday 



t 









Conviction of treason carries a 
maximum penalty of death and a 
minimum of five years' imprison- 
ment and a fine of $10,000. Sen- 
tence lies under the jurisdiction of 
the trial judge, in this case Judge 
William J. Campbell, who set next 
Friday for hearing motions of ap-l 
peal or pleas for mitigation of 
sentence. 

Elarlier the jury had heard 
Richard G. Finn, assistant Unjited 
States District Attorney, in his 
final address, describe the sab- 
otage plot v^ch first came to 
light with the capture of the sab- 
oteurs In New York and Florida 
who were later tried by Army 
court-martial, of whom Herbert 
Haupt wpLS one. 

The prosecutor described Hans 
Haupt, parent of the dead sabo- 
teur, a former soldier In the Kai- 
ser’s army, an official of the Ger- 
man World War Veterans Associa- 
tion Md a man who, according to 
witnesses, had “feeling only for 
Nazi Genfilii^' and who said, "If 
I had to joinithe U. S. Army I 
would crawl over to the German 
lines and tell the American battle 
positions.” 

Pointing at the defendants and 
describing them as "fifth column- 
ists” Mr. Finn said: 

"Look upon the Haupts. They 
are the cause of the shameful death 
of the boy, Herbert. And they as- 
sisted their son when he returned 
a saboteur. 

"Did they do this because he was 
their son ? No, they did not. 'They 
did it because he was the proud 
agent of the German Reich!” 



Kept Money for Saboteur 



.'i: 



» I 




rc 









I * . 




The prosecutor related the 
Froehling's part in sheltering and 
aiding Haupt, as brought out in the 
testimony, and recalled how Froeh- 
ling kept the saboteur's German 
bribe money, and. knowing his mis- 
sion, let the Froehling home be 
used as a contact point for phone 
calls between Haupt and the com- 
panion saboteur who accompanied 
him to Chicago. 

The prosecutor quoted the testi- 
mony of Mrs. Tim Kelly, who said 
she was taken by the Wergins to 
Bimd meetings and heard them 
make disloyal statements. She 
quoted Wer^n as sa 3 rLng that in a 
war between this country and Ger- 
many he would want Germany to 
win. 

For the defense, Paul A. F. 
Warnholtz attacked Mr. Finn's en- 
tire line of reasoning. He main- 
tained that the government has not 
proved treason, as it Is defined by 
the Constitution, and asserted that 
statements made by the defendants 
were obtained through third-degree 
methods by agents of the Federal 
Bureau pf Investigation. 

He defended Herbert Haupt's 
right to go to Germany to fight for 
that coulitry and said it was also 
Burger’s right "in 1940 when we 
were not at war.” 

Herbert Haupt was a German 
soldier and "it was his duty to de- 
stroy the property of the enemy.”

Background of Trial 
By Tht Ajsoclated Press. 

CHICAGO, Nov. 14 — The convic- 
tion tonight of six German- Amer- 
icans on charges of treason 
stemmed from the landing of eight 
Oermcm saboteurs in the United 
States from a Nazi submarine last 
June. All were captured and 
Heinrich Heinck, Werner Thiel, 
Herman Nsnrauer and John Kerl- 
ing were executed after conviction 
by a military commission. Ernest 
P. Burger, who testified at the 
treason trial, and George J. Das6h 
were sentenced to prison. 

The first person convicted of 
treason in the United States in 148 
years was Max Stephan of Detroit 
He was sentenced on Aug. 6 to be 
hanged for aiding a Nazi flier who 
escaped from a Canadian concen- 
tration camp, flis execution was 
stayed pending a bearing in Cin- 
cinnati on Dec. 12. 



GUILTY OF TREASON AT CHICAGO TRIAL 




Mrs. Walter Froehling (center) bursts into tears after hearing the verdict. With fire other German

733 RABBIS REBUKE 




ANTI-ZIONIST JEWS 



Joint Reply to Reform Croup 
Calls Its Pronouncement a 
‘Cruel Blow* to Palestine 



SEES POST-WAR MISERY 



Holds Many in Ravaged Europe 
Will Seek New Way of Life 
in Jewish Homeland 



Rabbis throughout the United 
States joined yesterday in a dec- 
laration rebuking Jewish oppo- 
nents of Zionism for dealing a 
"cruel blow” \j\ the Jews of Pal- 
estine and unwittingly strengthen- 
ing enemies of a Jewish homeland. 

The statement, signed by 733 
rabbis including the heads of all 
the naUonal rabbinical associa- 
tions, came as a rebuttal to a re- 
cent pronouncement by ninety re- 
form rabbis repudiating Zionism 
on the ground that it was Incon- 
sistent with Jewiish religious and 
moral doctrine. 

The statement of rejoinder, said 
to be without precedent in Jewish 
life in the United States, warned 
that the defeat of Germany would 
not automatically restore the nor- 
m'kl life of European Jews. It pre 
dieted that Europe would be so 
ravaged that large masses of Jews 
would seek migration to Palestine 
as the solution to their persona^ 
problems. 



Secularism Is Denied 



It denied the charge that Zion- 
ism was a secularist movement. 
On the contrary, the statement de- 
clared, the movement had its orig- 
ins in the authoritative religious 
texts of Judaism, so that anti 
Zionism Is "a departure from the 
Jewish religion.” 

Repl 3 ring to criUcsim of the 
Zionist movement’s political pro- 
gram, the statement asserted such 
a program was indispensable for 
assuring large-scale Jewish coloni- 
zation in Palestine; that the set- 
tlement of 500,000 Jews' there 
since World War I was made pos- 
sivle by political action that^cul- 



minated in the Balfour Declarm- j 
Uon and the Palestine Mandate, 
and that "there could be little hope 
of opening the doors of Palestine 
for mass Jewish Immigration after 
the war without effective political 
action." 

The rabbis deplored the idea that 
the Jews In Palestine should be 
prevented from ultimately con- 
stituting a majority of the popula- 
tion. Then, referring to the decla- 
ration by their ninety colleagues, 
their statement confinued: 

"Protesting their sympathy both 
for the homeless Jews of the world 
and for their brethern In Palestine, 
our colleagues have by their pro- 
nouncement done all these a grave 
disservice. It may well be that to 
the degree to which their efforts 
are at all effective, Jews who 
might otherwise have found a 
haven In Palestine will be denied 
one. The enemies of the Jewish 
homeland will be strengthened in 
tbeir propaganda as a result of 
the aid which these rabbis have 
given them. To the Jew* of 
Palestine, facing the gravest 
danger in their history and fight- 
ing hard to maintain morale and 
hope in the teeth of the totalitarian 
menace, this pronouncement comes 
as a cruel blow. 

"We do not mean to imply that 
our colleagues intended it as such. 
We have no doubt that they are 
earnest about their fine spun 
theoretical objections to Zionism. 
We hold, however, that these ob- 
jections have no merit and, further, 
that voicing them at this time has 
been unwise and. unkind.”

commander for bombing the Dort- 
mund-Eme Canal two years before. 



Zionism and Loyalty 



The rabbis expressed confidence 
that their fellow-Americans would 
not bo led to misconstrue the at- 
titude of American Jews to Amer- 
ica because of their interest In 
Zionism. They declared that all 
fair-minded Americans knew that 
Jews in this country bore only one 
political alleg;lance — to the United 
States. They said there was noth- 
ing in Zionism to impair this loy- 
alty. 

"The Jewish people is in danger 
of emreglng from this war not only 
more tom and broken than any 
other people, but also without any 
prospects of a better and more se- 
cure future and without the hope 
that such tragedies will not recur 
again and again,” the statement 
said. 

Among the signers were Rabbi 
James G. Heller of Cincinnati, 
president of the Central Conference

SAN JOSE, CaUf. (UP)— Police

hidden a suitcase and contents.

Special to Niw York Taas. 

BOSTON. Nov. 15 — Five fire- 
men were killed and nearly two 
score were Injured early today 
when a forty-foot granite and 
brick wall suddenly buckled and 
toppled into a burning foiur-story 
building in East Boston. 

The dead were Peter McMoixow, 
Daniel Maguire, Edward F. Ma- 
comber, John Foley and Francis 
Degan. 

The fire, starting from a fireless 
cooker in a cafe on the ground 
floor at Henry Street and Maverick 
Square, suddenly swept through 
the building. 

The firemen who were killed had 
just entered a restaurant in the 
second floor with a line of hose. 
As the flames at through the 
cross timbers the wall collapsed 
with a roar, burying two men on 
the stairs and crushing the three 
others nriannlng the hose. 

That part of the wall which fell 
outward felled about forty firemen 
standing on the Henry Street side 
of the building beside the new $20,- 
000 ladder truck, which was burled 
under the wreckage. 

At the same time, a hot air ex- 
plosion blew a half dozen firemen 
across Henry Street. 

Fire Chief Samuel Pope, who was 
just leaving the building, narrowly 
escaped the falling bricks. 

Firemen standing on a fire es- 
cape were plummeted to the ground 
and others posten on window sills 
slid down an extension ladder. 

As a granite cornerstone toppled, 
it struck a street lamp and 
plunged the area into darkness. 

Police and hospital ambulances 
sped to the scene as fourth and 
fifth alarms were sounded to bring 
additional help. As police re- 
sponded to emergency calls sent to 
all stations. Coast Guardsmen ar- 
rived and joined In rescue work. 

The civilian defense organization 
was mustered .and 200 auxiliary 
police and firemen gave assistance. 
The Red Cross mobile canteen and 
ambulances were at the scene. 

Before daybreak, all of the in- 
jured had been removed from the 
ruins and taken to hospitals. 
ThroughBlit the day crews of fire- 
men, police, sailors from the Navy 
Yard and shipyard riggers worked 



By Tortoise Way to Cigarettes 
Three Tortoises ( infantrymen 
of the London garrison who, ac- 
cording to their own complaints, 
would prefer to be elsewhere and 
fighting) were drinking beer at a 
pub when one of them asked for 
some clgfarettes. There w’ere none, 
One of the three said: “If you 

promise not to drink my beer, I’ll 
shove off roimd the comer and get 
a packet” After half an hour an 
other said: "Let’s drink his beer.” 
At this came a voice from the door: 
"If you do, I shan’t go round for 
the cigarettes.”

Text of the Army’s New Dimout Regulations 



Lehman Names New Yorker, 
a Member, to Succeed Rev. 

J. P. Boland as Chairman 



PRIEST ArSKED THE CHANGE 



The text of the new dimout reg- 
ulations announced yesterday by 
Major Gen. T. A. Terry, Command- 
ing General of the Second Service . 
Command, superseding those an- 
nounced last June 1, follows: 



Governor Praises Him as One 
Wise and Fair in Dealing 
With Work Disputes 



Special to Th* N«w York Tdcks. 

ALBANY. Nov. 15 — Governor 
Lehman today announced the ap- 
pointment of Paul M. Herzog of 
New York City to succeed the 
Rev. John P. Boland, pastor of St. 
Thomas Aquinas Church, Buffalo, 
as chairman of the State Labor 
Relations Board. Mr. Herzog will 
assume his new duties Immediately 
at 250 West Fifty-seventh Street, 
New York City. 

While asking to be relieved of 
the chairmanship at this time be- 
cause of the pressure of his 
pastoral obligations. Father Bo- 
land assured the Governor that 
he would remain a member of the 
board until Dec. 31. Six months 
®go he first informed Governor 
Lehman that he wished to be re- 
lieved of the duties of chairman, 
but at the Governor’s request 
agred to retain the chairmanship 
a little longer. 

Mr. Herzog, who has been a 
member of the board since its for- 
mation on June 24, 1937, was 
designated chairman by Mr. Leh- 
man at the joint recommendation 
of Father Boland and George L. 
Cassidy, former newspaper man 
and third member of the board. 

“I want to express to Father 
John P. Boland, both in my own 
behalf and on behalf of the people 
of the State, deep appreciation and 
gratitude for his splendid service 
as chairman of the State Labor 
Relations Board," Governor Leh- 
man said. ‘No man in the history 
of the State has done more for the 
cause of sympathetic and under- 
standing relations between man- 
agement and labor than Father Bo- 
land. He has been wise, patient, 
fair and tireless in the discharge 
of his duties, and I shall always be 
grateful to him for his unfailing 
assistance and encouragement.” ’ 

The Governor said he w'as 
pleased that the clergyman would 
remain on the board until the end 
of the year. 

In his letter of resignation. Fa- 
ther Boland said that Commission- 
er Cassidy joined him in recom- 
mending Mr. Herzog for the chair- 
manship because of his "unique 
knowledge of the substantive La- 
bor Relations Acts, State and Fed- 
eral, and because of his unswerving 
devotion to the democratic policy 
which inspired their passage, as 
w’ell as for his warm-hearted tact 
and natural honesty.” 

Mr. Herzog was born in New 
York City thirty-six years ago, is 
a graduate of Harvard, Class of 
*27, and took his law degree at 
Columbia. He it married and lives 
with his wife and tw'o children at 
784 Park Avenue. He is a director 
of the New York Leg^al Aid So- 
ciety, and from 1933 to 1935 w'as 
assistant secretary of the old Na- 
tional Labor Board, which preced- 
ed the National Labor Relations 
Board. 



JOIN PATROL CORPS, 
THE MAYOR URGES 



Business and Professional Men 
Not Doing Fall Share, He Says 

The city is faced with a shortage 
In the Police Department, Mayor 
La Guardia declared yesterday in 
appealing to more professional and 
business men to join the City Pa- 
trol Corps. 

At a reviewr and parade at the 
Seventy-first Armory, Park Ave- 
nue and Thirty-fourth Street, 
w’here citations for service beyond 
the line of duty were awrarded in 
the afternoon to five members of 
the patrol corps, the Mayor de- 
clared that the organization, which 
is composed of 7,000 men and 600 
w'omen, needed more members. 

"Veterans^ have responded gen- 
erously and*so have city employes 
and many professional and business 
men and executives," he said. "But 
the professional and business men 
and executives have not supplied 
their full quotas. I w^ant to ask 
more of them to contribute their 
ser\ices. 

"I have authorized Commissioner 
Valentine to add 250 more men to 
the force, and w’e just can’t get 
them. He has been at It two 
weeks, and the last I heard, he has 
been able to get only ninety-one 
men.” 

Those cited were Sergeant Alex- 
ander C. Ward of 105-25 Liberty 
End Avenue, Ozone Park, Queens; 
Private Irving O. Lippert, 98-31 
Sixty-fifth Road. Forest Hills, 
Queens; Priv*ate William A. Sharot, 
100-19 Ninety-second Avenue, Rich- 
mond Hill, Queens; Corporal James 
P. Barber of 109-24 164th Street, 
Jamaica. Queens, and Private Sam- 
uel O. Sears of 420 Wes^ 129th 
Street

part in the arrest of an armed 
hold-up man during a robbery. 
Berber and Sears saved the life of 
a woman who had fallen into the 
Harlem River. Tw’o hundred and 
ten officers received commissions.

purpose and those retained in use 
shall be permanently shielded in 
such a manner that the source of 
light will not be visible above the 
horizontal. 

9. The use of high-beam vehicle 
headlights within the coastal dim- 
out area is prohibited. Head- 
lights. if used, shall have the 
upper one-half of the lens ob- 
scured by opaque paint or other 
opaque material. (Headlights vis- 
ible from the sea must be further 
dimmed as provided in Para- 
graph 7.1 

10. All exterior lights used for

cial purposes, or both, industrial 
establishments engaged in pro- 
duction of war materials (w’hether 
federally owned or operated or

horizontal, and the escape of light 
therefrom shaill not exceed two 
foot candles at any point three 
feet from the said vehicles. 
Lights or windows in subway 
trains at such times as they are 
exposed above ground shall be 
subject to this regrulation. 

14. Bonfires, brush fires, burn- 
ing fields, and other outdoor

aerial navigation lights. 

SECTION V 

Non-Essential Illumination 

16. All exterior lights used for 
illumination of open areas, park- 
ing lots, gasoline filling stations, 
play grounds, places of amuse- 
ment or entertainment, sidewalk 
cafes, marquees, open-air gar- 
dens, terraces, for holiday deco- 
rations. and all other exterior 
lights not specifically covered by 
other regulations herein, shall be 
permanently shielded in such a 
manner that no source of light 
will be visible at an angle less 
than 45 degi'ees below the hori- 
zontal. Such lighting shall be 
further limited as follows: 

a. In no case shall the lighting 
as measured on the open area ex- 
ceed one foot candle at any point. 

b. In no case shall the total wat- 
tage used exceed the following 
limits; 

For incandescent bulbs— 1 '8th 
watt per square foot of lighted 
aiea. 

For fluorescent tubes — l/16th 
watt per square foot of lighted 
area. 

17. All exterior advertising signs, 
however illuminated, shall be ex- 
tinguished. 

18. Interior lighting of stores, 
show windows, restaurants, bars, 
commercial and industrial estab- 
lishments (other than war pro- 
duction plants) and all other in- 
terior lights, not specifically cov- 
ered by other regulations herein, 
shall be extinguished, or in lieu 
of such extinguishment shall be 
dimmed, shielded or otherwise 
controlled in such a manner as to 
prevent the source of light being 
visible from above the horizontal, 
and also so ais to prevent the 
escape of light from such building 
in excess of two-foot candles, as 
measured by a photronic cell held 
at any point three feet from any 
window’, door or other opening of 
such building or establishment. 

(Note— For the purpose of these 
regulations, some suggestions for 
accomplishiifg compliance with 
the above regulations are: 

a. Where show or display win- 
dows are lighted by incandescent 
bulbs and such bulbs are shielded 
in a manner to prevent them 
from being directly visible from 
the outside and such display win- 
dow is separated from the main 
portion of the store or establish- 



ment by a partition or other baf- 
fle, it has been determined that 
the escape of light will not 
violate these regulations if no 
more than ten watts per linear 
foot of window space is employed. 

b. Where fluorescent tubes are 
employed under conditions as out- 
lined in paragraph a above, it has 
been determined that the use of 
five watts per linear foot of win- 
dow space is permissible. 

c. Where the interior of the 
main portion of stores, j'estau- 
rants and other physically similar 
establishments are exposed to ex- 
terior view by large window's or 
openings, it has been found that 
the restriction of w'attagc to one- 
eighth watt per square foot of 
floor space is effective. 

d. Where it is desired to in- 
crease the wattage stated in notes 
a, b, c above, the use of fine mesh 
fabric curtains at the window’s, or 
filters or other methods or de- 
vices may be employed to limit 
the escape of light to that per- 
missible as stated in paragraph 18 
above.) 

SECTION VI 

Enforcement and Penalties 

19. Any person w'ho violates 
any regulation contained herein 
is subject to the penalties pro- 
vided by Title 18, Section 97a, 
United States Code (Note— This 
section provides a penalty of a 
fine not to exceed $5,000, or 
imprisonment for not more than 
one year, or both, for each of- 
fense). and to immediate ex- 
clusion from the Eastern Military 
Area. In addition, if two or more 
persons conspire to violate said 
Section 97a, United States Code, 
and one or more persons do any 
act to effect the object of such 
conspiracy, each of said parties 
will be subject to the penalties 
will be subject to the penalties pro- 
vided by. Title 18, Section 88, 
United States Code. In the case of 
an alien enemy, such person will, 
in addition, be subject to im- 
mediate apprehension and intern- 
ment. 

20. State and local civil author- 
ities within the States of New 
York, New Jersey and Delaware, 
with their consent, are desig- 
nated as the principal agencies 
to assist in the enforcement of 
these regulations. 

21. Effective Nov. 20, 1942, 

these regulations supersede all 
previous regulations issued by 
this headquarters concerning the 
control of artificial lighting with- 
in coastal dimout areas. 



NEW DIMOUT RULES 

ISSUED BY THE ARMY 



Continued From Page One 

at an angle less than 45 degrees 
! below the horizontal. 

1 7. Dimout regfulations will be in 

* force from one-half hour after sun- 
down until one-half hour before 
i sunrise between Oct. 1 and April 
I 30 inclusive, and from one hour 
f after sundown until one-half hour 
I before sunrise between May 1 and 
Sept. 30. 

8. The dimout zone now includes 
four additional New Jersey com- 
munities: Fort Lee, Teaneck, 

Englewood and Englewood Cliffs. 

Dimout Here for Duration 

In a statement accompanying 
the new regulations. General Terry 
emphasized the fact that control 
over artificial lighting in the sea- 
coast zone was here for the dura- 
tion of the war. Both Army and 
Navy authorities are attaching in- 
creasing importance to their en- 
forcement, General Terry said. 
General Terry said that his com- 
mand was cooperating closely with 
the Navy and with civilian light- 
ing engineers and the staffs of 
public utilities in studying the en- 
tire problem. He said that aerial 
reconnaissance would be employed 
reg^ular as a check on skyglow. 

"The cooperation of Governor 
Lehman, Governor Edison and 
Governor Bacon, of Mayor La 
Guardia and of the law-enforcing 
authorities of New York, New 
Jersey, and Delaware, has been a 
great help to the Army in making 
dimout effective,” General Terry 
said. "In considerable measure, 
progress made thus far is due to 
their increasing efforts.” 

General Terry added, however, 
that while in general this progress 
is gratifying, that much remains to 
be accomplished. 

"Dimout regulations are incon- 
venient,” he said. "However, they 
are essential to the preservation 
of human lives, the protection of 
vital war cargoes and coastal 
shipping. Therefore, they are going 
to be enforced, and feel confident 
that every sensible and patriotic 



individual In the seacoast areas will 

continue to cooperate.” 

The Army said that all Inquiries 
about the new regulations should 
be addressed to the Regional Of- 
fice of Civilian Defense, 122 East 
Forty-second Street. LExing^ton 
2-5700. 

SPENDS MORE ON DIMOUT 

Mayor Authorizes Added $63,000, 

Putting Total Above $500,000 

Mayor La Guardia declared in 
his weekly radio "Talk to the Peo- 
ple” that he recently authorized 
the expenditure of another $63,- 
000 for the dimming of additional 
street and highway lights, bring- 
ing the city’s expenses in this field 
a bit over the $500,000 mark. The 
additional expenditure was ordered, 
the Mayor said, after he had spent 
several hours last week aboard a 
pilot boat in the lower bay, observ- 
ing the shore lighting. 

"The shore line, so far as New 
York City was concerned, was 
dimmed out, I think, most satis- 
factorily,” the Mayor declared. 

: "There were a few spots that I 
have ordered the Department of 
Water Supply, Gas and Electricity 
to attend to at once. There was a 
sky glow, but Tm sure that we are 
contributing relatively less than 
our share of that sky glow. It’s up 
to the Army to get uniform en- 
forcement in the entire metropoli- 
tan district. That means, of course, 
New Jersey, Westchester, Con- 
necticut and Long Island.” , 

Manhattan seemed to him the 
darkest of the five boroughs, as 
viewed from the lower bay. Mayor 
La Guardia said, and so the other 
boroughs will have to dim out 
some more. 

"As I say, I am complying with 
Army regulations and doing so 
cheerfully,” the Mayor said. "I 
still believe that the whole require- 
ment is exaggerated. It is my be- 
lief that once the shore line is 
properly dimmed out that answers 
the full purposes, but we will con- 
tinue to comply.” 

Radio Links Work and Play 

MARTIN’S FERRY, Ohio (U.E)~ 
Even though Gomer Davis is a 
mail carrier, he did not let his work 
interfere with listening to the world 
series. He slung his son’s portable 
radio over his shoulder with his 
mail bag and listened while he 
worked.

That's the proving ground 
of a parachute— just 
as the "T-Zone" Is the 
proving ground of your 
cigarette (see below) 

OU can test them in labora- 
tories and wind tunnels . . • 
You can toss them out with 
weighted dummies . . . 

But the final test of a parachute 
is the 'Tive test”— when you step 
out in mid-air in an actual jump. 

And its like that with cigarettes, 
too. The final test of any brand is 
when you light it and smoke it. 

Adeline Gray, a steady Camel 
smoker, can tell you: ^Camels are 
never harsh or irritating on my 
throat. They’re milder all ways.’* 
Many a man at the front could 
tell you the same— for Camels are 
the favorite pack there, too. But 
only your own taste and throat 
—only your own ”T-Zone”— 
can tell you the cigarette that 
suits you best. 

Try Camels next time and find 
out the facts for yourself.

AS I SEE TODAY 

By G. C. Aquino, Jr. 

TWO GREAT PARTIES 

« 

At last the Republican Party has 
its man in Governor Thomas E. 
Dewey. On the o;hcr side ot the 
fence, the Democratic Party has its 
man in President Franklin D. Roosc 
vcit. 

The 1944 Presklcniial election pro 
miscs to be the most profound na- 
tion;il election of the United States. 
The American way of life is going 
to be one of the issues of this camp- 
aign, and perhaps, next only to 
state’s right. 

Who will win in November? It 
is hard to choose right now between 
the tjwo great parties. The two stand 
ard bearers must be taken into con- 
sideration; they will play an import- 
ant part in the campaign. Sometimes 
election is won by personalities. 
But a Southern revolt by the Sou- 
thern Democrats against their own 
party, if there is going to be one, 
will help the cause of Dewey tre- 
mendously. 

THE FALA 

The downfall of the FALA is 
now a major topic of conversation 
among Filipinos in California. From 
reliable sources, somebody is putting 
the entire blame to J. C. Dionisio 
who became the Rresident when the 
FALA was already on its way down 
the hill. The brake was very loose 
then, and the only thing Mr. Dio- 
ni io could do '.\as to fix the brake. 
It is regrettable that Mr. Dionisio 
was net able to fix it. Sometimes, 
goed mechanics canont fix a badly 
damaged car. Now, do we have to 
put the enure blame :o one man? 

f. C. Dionisio was only a victim 
of the circumstances. If the inform- 
ation is correct, Dr. Macario Bau- 
tista was the President of the FALA 
ever since it was founded uhtil April 
1941 when he resigned to accept 
a posi'ion in the Pacific Coast of- 
fice of the Philippine Resident Cem- 
tuis'ipncr. Tlie Vice Prcsulcnt. Pa- 
tricio Olltr, became the President 
until luly 1041 when Mr. Dionisio 
was elected President of the union, 
better known as the FALA. 

Taking all things into considera- 
tion, Dr. Bautisra shouldn’. have 
resigned as President of the FALA. 
As a good leader, he should have 
stayed with the FALA as a Captain 
of a ship does with his ship. But 
Dr. Bautista preferred, perhaps, to 
resign and to take a job in San Fran 
.isco than to save he Filipino Agri- 
cultural Laborers* Association which 
o\as the life blood of the working 
men. A good Captain will never 
leave his sinking ship until all his 
men are out. In like manner, a 
good leader will never lit his men 
down. 

FILIPINO WOMEN 

It is interesting to note that our 
women are very inicrcs.cd in our 
civic affairs. They attend the meet- 
ings of their respective communities 
and participate in debating a certain 
subject- Sometimes, a woman, par- 
ticipating in a debate, is au influen-” 
tial factor in the solution of a cert- 
ain problem, in fact there arc wo- 
men now leading Filipino commu- 
nities. In the state of Washington, 
we have Miss Maxine Gonong, a 
graduate of the University of Wa- 
shington, as the President of • the 
Filipino Community of Scatde. In 
California, we have Mrs. Caridad 
Gonzales as the President of the Fi- 
lipino Community of Momcrcy Pe- 
ninsula and Mrs. Felix Diangson as 
the President of the Filipino Com- 
munity of Northeastern Alameda 
and Contra Counties. Miss Pacita 
Todlod was past President of the 
Filipino Community of San Jose 
and she was the first of the female 
sex to become a Vice President of 
Inter-Community organization. Mrs. 
Juanita Alfafara of San Francisco 
has taken an active part in all Itncr- 
Conrtmuniiy affairs. Mrs. Rcsita Ta- 
basa was past President of the Fili- 
pino Community of Watsonville 
and Mrs. Ccnnic Ramirez is one 
of the leaders of the Imcrnaliona* 
Women’s Club in that community. 
In moulding the moral and spiritual 
life of our boys and girls, we have 

such ladies as Mrs. Adclb Cacas, 

0 

Mrs. J. B. Sampayan, Mrs. G. Ma- 

ratas, Mrs. B. Lozada, Mrs. Frank 
Maratai and Mrs. H. Della 

Yes, our iwomcn arc taking an 
active part in our civic affairs as 
well as in our spiritual affairs. With- 
out <hc help of our women, we can 
never succeed in our local affairs 
in this country.

OUR BOYS IN 
SERVICE 

By PAMBRAS 

This is the second in a series of 
articles about our boys tu ho arc out 
there in the midst of battle fighting 
for us. Let’s give them our full sup- 
port. 

Sgt. Pete Agustin’s last few 
months in the states, we arc sure, 
were happy and months he will ne- 
ver forget. Alter being engaged to 
lovely Miss Pacita Montaylrc for 
a length of lime his wish finally 
came true. The result of changing 
the name Montayre to Agustin made 
him the happiest person you ima- 
gine. 

He is of Co. “A” in the 2 nd Fi- 
lipino Bn. and has worked hard for 
the stripes which wc kntnv he de- 
serves. Keep up the g(xxl work, Sgt. 

Sgt. Richard Molina of the ist 
Filipino Bn. and has worked hard 
for thoic stripes. 

In civilian life he was a simple 
and unassuming person, but has ma 
chine-gun crew. With fellows like 
that on our side those now develop- 
ed into a crack shot machine gun- 
ner and is also the head of his ma- 
chine gun crew. With fellows like 
that on OTjir side those against us 
will surely have a tough time. ' 
Then there is Pvt. Sonny Sensano 
of the and Filipino Inf. Co., D to 

Birthday Party 

On the i6th of this month, Mrs. 
Carmen Narciso, of Salinas, reach- 
ed her twenty olfc summers. There 
was a part)' in honor of the former 
Miss Carmen Flores at the camp 
of Mr. J- F. Cacas. It was an enjoy- 
able party and it was well attended 
by the boys at the camp. .-Vmong the 
families present were Nfr. and Mrs. 
Johnny Barnacha and Mr. and Mrs. 
Benjamin Dclbincs. 



be exact. He belongs to the organi- 
zation of the B. G’s and is he proud 
of it. But he is still prouder of the 
great organization he belongs to 
now, the United States Army. He 
spent raosc of his last few week- 
ends here in Los. Angeles and be- 
cause one of the favorite jitterbugs 
of many of the girls. But dancing 
isn’t the only thing he exm do. He 
can fight, and with more like hiip 
in this army. Victory isn’t far. 

.\noihcr swell guy is Cpl. Alex 
Fabros of the 2 nd Fil. Inf. Alex 
has the address of almost every pi- 
nay in the State of California. Now 



he is the head of the “Wolf Club’’f Last but not least in this series 



of the 2 nd Inf. and carries the tide 
of ‘/Chief Lobo’’. While in Los 
Angeles he proposed to almost every 
girl in the city as was expected of 
any “Lobo”. Anyway he is one 
grand guy and «vntc won’t forget him. 

Speaking of Cpl’s we must’nt 
leave out Cpl. Vince Catudio. He’s 
from Frisco and loves the place in 
more ways than one. He’s one guy 
that can hold his own in any crowd 
and wc aren’t kidding. Although he 
spent many of his weekends in L.A. 
his heart was really in Frisco, and 

we don’t blame him. Happy landing 
Vince.

Douglas Leads Nation 
In Plane production 

SANTA (MONICA, Cal.— For the 
first five months of 1944 Douglas 
Aircraft company produced an 
average of 17.2 percent of the na- 
tion’s war planes.. The figure Is 
on the basis of pounds of air- 
frames produced. This production 
leads the country and outstrips 
Douglas’ nearest rival by more 
than 7,000,000 pounds. 

May's production of airframes — 
plane bodies exclusive of engines, 
I propellers, armament and govern- 
ment furnished eaulpment — was 
16,380,000 pounds with an addi- 
tional 2,000,000 pounds of spares, 
F. W. Conant, vice president in 
charge of anufacturing, said. 

In amassing the tremendous to- 
tal of planes Douglas included in 
Its contribution to America’s air 
power frames for A-20 Havocs, 
C-47 Skytralns, C-54 Skymasters, 
B-24 Liberators, B-17 Flying For- 



tresses, and SBD Dauntless dive 
bombers. 

In addition to Its record of pro- 
duction by weight of airframes, 
Douglas also produced the great- 
est unit volume in many months. 
For reasons of military security 
the number of units cannot be 
revealed. However, Conant an- 
nounced that the unit production 
was 13.8 percent of the nation’s 
total. 

I Conant pointed out that the May 
unit figure was achieved in spite 
of the fact that the planes Doug- 
las now produces weigh more 
on an average than those hereto- 
fore manufactured. 

“Considering a 1 1 factors with 
which we have had to contend 
during this year’s operations, we 
have every reason to be proud 
of our championship production 
thus far in 1944,’’ Conant said.

C^ommunity donference 




The conference is only about a month from now, August 
24-27 CO be exact. A delegate will spend at least five dollars 
a day, and the Filipino Community of Fresno and Vicinity, the 
host of the conference, will spend more than a thousand dollars. 
It sounds like a big money, but the noble purpose of the con- 
vention is worth more than that amount.

Cooperation is always an asset in the consummation of any 
activity. It docs not mean that a man must follow another 
man's way. Of course, we fight for principles, but we must 
not fight for personalities. If we can eradicate the latter, we can 
solve our problems intelligently and peacefully. This is the way

twenty five years will never be long enough to effecuate some- 
thing worth while. What is the reason for this? The cause

is obvious. When the President of the organization is not our 
best friend, we do not want to cooperate with him. This at- 
titude must be buried deep into the mud; or else we will never 
get anywhere. Let us be all for one and one for all. 



Our organization is now six years old. Yes, six years of 
administration and six years of planning. Six years was not long 
enough to accomplish something for us. If this is the case. 



There arc many things to be done in the convention. One 
of these is the election of officers. It is here where our disunity 
starts. When we or our friends lose an election, we just do not 
want to support the officers elected. We just sit down like sit- 
down strikers in a defense plant. Sometimes, we do worst than 
that. Instead of sitting down, we try to find a means by which 
we can knock those officers out. Of course constructive criticism 
is always helpful. And this is the way our attitude should be. 



the Inter-Community organization. A community must at least 
refer its problem to the organization at the time it refers 
its problem totheWestern Divison or to the Nationals 
Division in Washington, D. C. Under the constitution of the 
organzation. the communities are within the jurisdicton of the 
Inter-Community organization. In this case, the relation be- 
tween the two is just like the relation between a father and a son. 
It is only fair, therefore, that a father ought to know what is 
going on between bis son and his son’s godfather. 







There must be a closer tie between the communities anci 



Now let us all be friends. Let us go to Fresno with new 
enthusiasm, new spirit and new vision. Let us go to the confer- 
^cncc with the idea of working hand in hand with one another. 

Let us unite our efforts. Let us act in concert, jon forces, fra- 
ternize and cling to one another. Let us show to the world that 
we Filipinos can solve our problems peacefully. 





TRIBUTE 







lOSE RIZAL 




Addressing himself to the Filipino 
youth both in America and in the 
Philippines, Coioncl Carlos P. Ro- 
mulo. Secretary of Information and 
Public Relations, enjoined them “to 
begin noA‘ to think of the days of 
reconstruction in our country.” He 
announced tlhat President Manuel 
L. Quezon has evolved a compre- 
hensive plan for the relief and re- 
habilitation of the F^Hippincs and 
that the War Cabinet is prepared 
to carry out the details of die plan. 
The speech was deliver before the 
rilipino Executive Council for Wa- 
shington on the occasion of che ce- 
lebration of nhe 83rd birthday anni- 
versary of Dr. Jose Rizal, June 19, 

T944* 

After paying tribute to the youth 
for the part that it played in Ba- 
taan and for its continued resist- 
ance against the Japanese invader 
in the Philippines today, Colonel 
Romulo declared that “we the youth 
have in our hands the tools with 
which to sha|?c che future of our 
country" and he cxhor'.cd them “to 
use those tools lo the best .advant- 
age” and “not merely talk about 
them." 

Coioncl Romulo's address fol- 
Dws: 



I “In Rizal was personified the 
< mature, responsible youth of the 
{lime speaking through the years to 
the maturing, responsible youoh of 
our generation. No exemplar, there- 
fore, can be more worthy of our 
imitation, no hero more deserving 
of our worship than this man whose 
clear eye saw, through the darkness 
of oppression, the inalienable dignity 
and worth of our people, whose 
great mind could conceive thcr am 
bitions and dreams, and whose 
heart had the courage and fire to 
dare to stand up and demand his 
people’s freedom. 

“No portion of Rizal’s message to 
his countrymen «which is embodied 
in all his writings, in his novels, 
poems and letters, is more stirring 
dian the words that he addressed 
to the youth of the land. “Fair hope 
of the Motherland” fhc called them, 
knowing well that the tremendous 
task of rearing our nation in light 
and ferodom was a task of young 
and vigorous hands to carry on to 
a Succes'.ful consumation. 

“Chamcierisiic is the sentiment 
in this stanza of “My Last Fare- 
well: 



U' 






Jose Rizal died young. When he 
was shot on Bagumbayan field th^t 
early December morning more than 
forty-seven years ago, he was only 
•.hirl^-fivc. Behind him was a record 
>f achievement that would have 
done credit to a man much older 
than he; before him the prospect of 
many more years rich in devoted 
service to the freedom of his people. 

“I cmpliasize his youth and I ad- 
dress myself <0 the Filipino youth 
l>oth here in America and in the 
Philippines today because it was 
the Filipino youth who fought in 
Bataan and it is the youth who are 
now fighting in the hills and the 
mountains of our homeland. To 
them artd to the youth who will play 
an important role in the reconquest 
and reconstruction of our country, 
my words are dedicated tonight. 

“But first, who was this man that 
had dared challenge the nobler spi- 
rit of Spain into giving justice lo 
his people? Who was this man that 
had fired the hearts of his people 
into aspiring for the inalienable 
rights of man? 

“He was a man gifted with ex- 
ceptional abilities, a man of genius, 
dowyred far beyond most of his 
contemporaries with a will to serve 
and a will to be free. He was a 
man with a clear purpose and a 
courageous will. 

“He was, above all, a young mai^. 
The secret of Rizal’s fascination for 
us lies y^ircciscly in the fact that al- 
ways we shall remember him as 
young — young not merely in years 
but in ideas, in the force of his cha- 
racter and in the igor of his will. 
Always we shall chink of him as a 
flame giving light more than heat, 
illuminating more than searing the 
consciences both of the rulers and 
the ruled. 



“My dreams when yet a boy, adoles- 
cent and free 

“My dreams in my manhood with 
sire jgih aglow, 

“Were to see thee, Gem of the 
Orient Sea 

“Thy dark eyes tearless, lifted high 
thy brow 
. “With neither blush nor fear, nor 
shade or woe. 

“Here is the sentiment and the 
c.xpression of a man who retained 
till the end the beauty and the po- 
wer of his youthful dreams, a man 
•who saw in the dreams of his youth 
the only redemption for his country 
and the only way. While in most 
men the dreams of youth seem dest- 
ined to fade, to grow less urgent 
amidst the more immediate preoccu- 
pation of everyday life, in Rizal 
these dreams became a source of 
constant inspiration, sustaining him 
until the last fateful hour when as 
if to steel himself against the end, 
he summoned the dreams that gave 
his youth joy as well as pathos, pur- 
'posc as well as challenge. 



“In Rizal the dream suffered no 
{tarnishing from the years. On the 
contrary, every year that passed only 

* sharpened his pcrqrpdons and 

* strengthened in him the desire to 

* speed the day when che Motherland 
'could raise its “brow serene” bc- 
{causc the stai nof infamy had been 
I washed from it. Nothing better pro- 
ves the vitality of Rizal’s faith in 



the soundness of his own ideals 



than that (he willingly laid down his 
life for the dreams that he cherish- 
ed. 



and patiently for the freedom and 
welfare of our people. In their youth 
they listened to the voice of Rizal 
and heeded it. We can never repay 
che gratitude we owe thcih for 
what they have done to make the 
dreams of Rizal come true. No, Ri- 
zal does not need to speak to our 
ciders. But it is the young people 
of the Philippines, in whose hands 
our future lies; and it is to us he 
would speak. Our Filipino youth 
must take up the burden which our 
elders have carried for so many 
years; we must complete the struct- 
ure of freedom on the finn found- 
ation our fathers have prepared. It 
is wc who need the counsel of Jose 
, Rizal. 

I “What would Ri2u»l, were he alive 
! today, want to say to the youth of 
'the land? He ‘A’ould not liave lo tdl 
, us to be brave and steadfast and 
j loyal to our country. The whole 
world knows of the courage and 
patriotism of the Filipino youth who 
fought against overwhelming odds 
! in the foxholes of Bataan. They do 
not have to be told to be brave and 
loyal. Nor must those who arc now 
living under the Japanese oppressor 
be exhorted lo courage and patrio- 
tism. They have refused to crook 
their knee to the invader. They have 
kept their honor and dignity in 
spite of terrific co;t. Words arc an 
affront to heroes — and our youth 
in the Islands arc truly heroes. 

I “No, Rizal, if he were alive 10- 
,day, would not ask our youuK to 
j BE brave and' loyal. But he would 
I tell them to CONTINUE to be bra- 
|Vc and loyal. He would tell them 
that our counyy needs their since- 
rity of opinion, honesty qf purpose 
and courage of conviction just as 
much after the hated invader is 
driven from our shores as it docs 
now. Wc are inspired by our heroes 
'of battle — wc salufc their courage 
'and wc thrill our heroes of battle — 
we salute ilicir courage and . wc 
thrill at ilhcir exploits. But no na- 
tion’s greatness is won on the field 
of battle alone, but in the fields 
and shops and factories and offices 
where the workers toil, in the homes 
and schools where the children learn 
greatness of heart and keenness of 
mind, in the halls of government 
where the leaders plan for the wel- 
fare and dignity of (he nation. 

“Rizal would call up>on us, the 
youth of today to continue dedicat- 
ing ourselves loyally to the cause 
of freedom. He would warn us ag- 
ainst indifference and complacency 
when peace is restored; he would 
tell us that now is the time for us 
to acudy and prepare and plan for 
the future; so that when wc arc 
faced with the decisions wc must 
make, wc can act wisely and with- 
out fear or hccsitation. 



“On this, the eighty-third anni- 
versary of his birth, I like co think 
of Jose Rizal as a young man of his 
generation speaking <0 us the young 
men and young W'omcn of this ge- 
neration. His message is not to 
our dders uvho have labored long 



“Abo^*c all, Rizal would tell us 
to cherish those things for which 
wc arc now fighting. Liberty, demo- 
cracy, independence arc not mere 
r,\x)rds. They are mighty forces of 
irresistible power. Like the waters 
of a cataract, they can be channeled 



^an<l directed, but they cannot be 
stemmed. 

“We know what freedom is; wc 
have paid and are paying for it in 
toil and agony and blood. Wc know 
too, what national independence 
means and wc will pay the cost. 
Above all, wc know that the price 
of freedom and independence is ne- 
ver paid in full. Wc cannot buy free 
dom and independence as wc buy 
chattels. Wc can never pay a stipu- 
lated sum and get a bill of sale for 
us and our heirs and assigns for- 
ever. No— w-c must pay for free- 
dom and independence every day 
of our lives, and our children and 
our children’s children after us I 

Ecternal vigilance is the price of 
liberty. That must be our watch- 
world. Wc must guard our freedom 
with an Argust-eyed vigilance. Inva- 
sion and armed conquest are not 
the only dangers to fear; wc can 
lore freedom just as surely through 
inner weakness. If wc lack self-dis- 
cipline' and self-control, if wc refuse 
lo practice selfdenial for the good 
of our country, if wc forget self- 
respect and dignity, if wc do not 
have the courage .of our convictions, 
if we temporize when to do so is 
I to surrender our people’s welfare 
|fo rthe sake of' personal ambition, 
lue cannot keep our freedom, and 
no one else can keep it for us. 

“It is all the more needful for us, 
therefore, to hark back to the tca- 
oliings of Rizal today, to be fired 
anew by his patriotism, and to 
draw counsel from his sound judg- 
ment. Wc venerate Rizal’s idealism, 
wc admire his courage, but loo often 
wc forget his sound common sense. 
Rizal was not just a dreamer of 
dreams; he was a man of intense 
practicability. He knew well that 
individual freedom and national in- 
dependence aro worthless unless sup 
ported by the physical well-being, 
material prosperty, and moral 
strength of the people themselves. 
If Rzal were alive t^ay, he would 
ask our youth to begin now to 
think of the days of reconstruction 
in our country and to study the 
measures that will hdp correct the 
ills of our social and economic life. 

“Our leader, Pitesident Manuel L. 
Quezon, has evolved a comprehen- 
*sivc plan that encompasses the pro- 
blems of relief and rehabilitation of 
our people, and his War Cabinet is 
prepared to cariy out the details of 
the plan. Our youth should take a 
militant participation and should 
support the extension of a greater 
measure of socfal justice for our 
people, the establishment of a na- 
tional economy that will have for 
its goal the well-being of the many, 
'not prosperity for the few. Rizal 
■ would tell us that important as it 
is to secure cur country’s independ- 
ence from encroachment from with 
out, it is equally important to pre- 
serve it from the weakness of po- 
verty within. 

“If Rizal were alive today, he 
would say to our youth — you have 
a big task before you and you must 
be big yourselves if you arc to be 
equal to it. Look to the work which 
lies before you — the rehabilitation 
and reconstruction of our country, 
the building of a planned national 



STATEMENT OF OSMENA AFTER PRESIDENTtQuezon’s StatemenI 



ROOSEVELT SIGNED RESOLUTIONS 



Ibc enactment of Senate Joint 
Rcst^utions 93 and 94 is a long step 
toward the real freedom and inde- 
pendence of the Rhilippines and its 
'survival as a free and Christian na- 
tion. This legislation authorizes the 
advancement of the recognition of 
Philippine independence from the 
date already fixed by law, July 4, 
1946; p)TOvidcs for naval and air ba- 
ses to be maintained not for Ame- 
rican purposes alone but for the mu- 
tual protection of the instrumcntXLlity 
for the speedy consideration by the 
two governments of matters affect- 
ing postwar economy, trade, finance 
economic stability and rehabilitation 
of the Philippines, including dam- 
lagcs to public and private property 
and to persons occasioned by enemy 
(attack and occupation. 

I 

Early in December, 1941, when 



Japan attkked the Philippines, the 
President of the United Skates made 
a solan nplcdgc that the freedom 
'of the Philippines will be redeemed 
and its independence established 
and protected. Thereafter this 
pledge was reiterated. For this the 
Filipino people arc profoundly 
I thankful. Now, on this matter of 
fundamental public policy, the Con- 
gress, the policy-making body un- 
•der the Constitution, has taken act- 
^ion embodied in a formal enact- 
ment permanently placed in the sta- 
tute books of the United States. 






economy the increase of social just- 
ice, and the preservation of your 
liberty and indppendcncc, and do 
not waste your time in petty perso- 
nalities in bickerings and backbit- 
ings, in political mudslinging. Do 
the task that lies at hand to the 
best of your ability, constantly pre- 
pare yourselves for the tasks which 
lie ahead, act >vhcn you must with- 
out fear of vacillation. Waste not 
your time in useless carping. 

“Wc, the youth of today, have in 
our hands the tools with which to 
shape our future and the future of 
our country. Let us use chose tools 
to the best advantage, use them, I 
say, not merely talk about them. 
When wc know what our duty is, 
let us comply with it with che same 
determination and courage, wth 
the same unalloyed patriotism, that 
iwas shown by our youth in Bataan 
and that is being shown by our 
imconquerablcs in their continued 
resistance in the Philippines today. 
Let us go to our native land ready 
to help usher in for our people a 
truly now day. 



Under these Congressional enact- 
ments, the suHcrings and sacrifices 
brought by this war on our people 
will be ameliorated as much as pos- 
sible, the ravages and destruction 
fully repaired and the economic 
structure of the coimtry rebuilt and 
I strenghtened. While the liberating 
' forces landing on Philippine soil 
will carry with them tanks, guns 
and other weapons of 'w'ar, the rc- 
presentadves of the Commonwealth 
Government will bring to our starv- 
ing people food, medical supplies, 
'clothing, school books, plows and 
other farm implements. With the 
destruction of the power of the ene- 
my, individual rights and polidcal 
and religious freedom will be restor- 
ed in the Philippines. And follow- 
ing the orderly processes prescribed 
by the Independence law and the 
Consdtudon of the Philippines, the 
indcpcndec Philippine Republic sup>- 
ported by this great and friendly na- 
don, will emerge safe and secure 
against external aggression. 



On 4th of July 



“Our nation has been great be- 
cause of what our heroes, Jose Ri- 
zal among them, dreamt is might 
some day become. Our nation shall 
become greater still because of what 
our generadon is doing right now 
to make it worthy of the id^ls of 
our fathers. Our history is glorious 
because of what the past has been; 
our history shall become more glo- 
rious sdll because of what our fu- 
ture is going to be. On our genera- 
tion now fdls the task so to mould 
our nadonal destiny that the gene- 
rations coming after shall have cause 
only to Wess our memory as we now 
bless the memory of those who went 
before us. 



When I appeared before the 
House Committee on Insular Af- 
fairs to urge the approval of Senate 
Joint Resolutions 93 and 94, I said 
that I considered che passage of 
these two resoludons of vital im- 
portance to the wdfare of our two 
peoples. I repeat this statement now 
svith the addition that the news of 
this acdon of Congress will bring 
new hopes to the Filipino people, 
now enslaved by the enemy, and 
will insdll in them rencw’cd cour- 
age and united determiation to 
effeedvely assist the liberadng forces 

when our D-day comes. 



I believe I express the sendment 
of the Filipino people when I say 
that wc are deeply grateful lo the 
President and the Congress of the 
United States for the approval of 
this Icgisladon.

Manuel L. Quezon, President ot 
the Philippines issued llu: following 
statement for broadcast to the Phih- 
ppines on July 4: 

“My fellow countrymen: 

Fourth of July lliis year lus a 
special meaning to us in the Philip- 
pines. Wc have celebrated it in tlic 
past as a milestone in the history of 
the United States. It marks the day 
of American independence from an 
alien rule. 

A few years ago, President Roos- 
velt signed Senate Joint Rcsoiuaon 
No. 93 advancing Philippine inde- 
pendence prior to July 4, 1946. This 
year’s July Fourth, therefore, takes 
on a now significance. Freedom is 
indivisible and America shows the 
world that its belief in freedom 
so strong it docs not deny it to o- 
thers. k gives the American sol- 
dier, wherever he may be in this 
global war, an epitome of nv*hat he 
is fighting for. Freedom not only 
for himself but for odicr peoples as 
well. 

General MacArthur continues 
pressing forward in his steady ad- 
vance in the Southwest Pacific. Hjs 
victories in Hollandia and recently 
Biac bring him and the army of 
liberation under his command near- 
er to Philippine shores. The forces 
under Admiral Nimitz arc also 
staging a series of spectacular vio 
orics. A staggering blow was rc- 
cendy dealt the Japanese fleet off 
the Philippine sea. 

The forces of freedom and demo- 
cracy arc marching onward irresis- 
tibly. As wc commeoratc today’s 
American Independence Day, let us 
take renewed strength in chc con- 
fident cxpcctadon that soon our own 
Fourth of July from Japanese op- 
pression win ^wn for us. It will 
not take long now*.

A total of 14,000 servvicemen of 
all branches of the U. S. Armed

contact w’ith the general hospi- 
tality of the USO, City and County 
sponsored hostels, and the many 
places of Interest and entertain- 
ment for servicemen provided by 
public spirited local groups. 

A staff of 139 volunteers under 
Mrs. Wesley La Fever, Staff 
Chairman and Mrs. Frank B. Keel- 
an, Personnell Chairman, working 
in groups of 4 or 5 on four-hour 
shifts answers the many questions 
that the men fire at them. 

Four queries top the list of 
dozens of questions the men ask: 
'AVhere can we find a place to 
Bleep?” “What is there to see 
that's most Interesting in your 
city?” “Where can we dance?" 
And, when funds are low on Sun- 
day nights: “How can I hitch a

the. Filipino United Church at Sa- 
linas, California, sponsored a Ping

Cacas, a labor contractor, received 
a trophy donated by Mr. Fred Ca- 
bacungan, a businessman, as a res- 
ult of his victory over Mr. Frank

is only a minor sport of the two 
finalists. They arc both enthusiastic 
in tennis. -Mr. Maratas received a 
second prize award donated by the 
Philippine Trading Company.

Miss Balasabas played a superb 
game when she defeated Mrs. Adc- 
lia Cacas iwho was never beaten in 
a tournament before she met the 
high school lass at the final. Mrs. j 
Cacas showed her sportmanship 
when she said that, Miss Balasabas 
is really a good pleaycr. “I enjoyed 
the game” she remarked. ‘*I am look 
ing forward to meet Catalina again 
in a ping pong tournament.” The 
game was carried to three sets.

QUEZON 

The most powerful political 
leader of the Filipino people, 
Manuel Luis Quezon, did not 
live long cnou||h to see the day 
of liberation of his beloved Phil* 
ippines from Japanese domina- 
tion. 

He had looked forward to go- 
ing back to his native land to be 
the first President of an indepen- 
dent Philippine Republic, under 
the guidance and protection of 
the United States of America, 
but death at 65 has robbed him 
of that triumphant return to his 
adored motherland. 

Quezon devoted his entire life 
to attaining independence of his 
country. During his spectacular 
leadership for the freedom of his 
people he had undergone many 
hardships, but through his uncan- 
ny skill in handling delicate prob- 
lems and through his indomitable 
courage and fortitude in facing 
those who had vainly tried to op- 
pose him, he had in the end paci- 
fied and won them to his Nation- 
alista Party. 

In his earnestness and persis- 
tence in seeking for Philippine 
Independence, Quezon once said, 
“I would rather live under a 
government run like hell by Fili- 
pinos than one run like heaven 
by Americans.” Such is Quezon 
in his fiery mood. 

Quezon had been suffering 
from tuberculosis for a number 
of years and his epic escape 
through the Japanese blockade 
had greatly sapped his vitality 
xnd strength. 

It was in that fateful morning 
of August 1, 1944, amidst quiet 
and silence in Saranac Lake, New 
York, that Manuel Luis Quezon 
succumb to his lingering illness. 

Quezon’s death is the most im- 
portant Philippine casualty in the 
World War II. Millions mourn 
his passing. 

God bless him. May he rest in 
peace. 

OSMENA 

The favorite son of Cebu, Ser- 
gio Osmena, has taken the oath 
of office as the President of the 
Philippin'es. The history of his 
rise in Philippine politics is in- 
separable with the successful 
leadership of the late Manuel L. 
Quezon. 

Osmena and Quezon have 
fought together side by side 
throughout their political careers 
and their devotion has ripened 
with the years into genuine 
friendship. Their abiding loyal- 
ty has nurtured profound respect 
toward each other’s capabilities 
which has stood the test of all 
political controversies. 

Sergio Osmena has a great task 
ahead of him. The future destiny 
of the Islands is entrusted under 
his leadership. 

May God watch and protect 
him in the unfinished work that 
remains to be accomplished and 
may He help guide him in his 
role as Chief Executive and Pres- 
ident of the Philippines. 

"OUR WORLD” 

We are grateful to Evaristo C. 
Pecson for his inspiring and en- 
lightening book, "O U R 
WORLD.” His book is exerting 
a good influence in the lives of 
the young and the old. 

Here arc a few comments:

PECSON PAYS 
HOMAGE TO 
QUEZON 

BY VICTOR N. RAMAJO 

The dynamic leader of thous- 
ands of Filipinos in America, Ha- 
waii and the Philippines, Evaristo 
C. Pecson, was deeply touched 
by the demise of the late Presi- 
dent Manuel Luis Quezon of the 
Philippines. 

Upon receiving the sad news of 
the death of the fiery Chief 
Executive of the Islands, Mr. 
Pecson immediately sent word to 
his followers to pay homage and 
j respect to a dear and beloved 
Mrs. Salud Pecson, an accomplish- 1 friend and leader who has dedi-

Mr. Pecson’s devotion to Que-

he has been reticent in recount*

ed Mr. Pecson back to Washing- 
ton, D. C.J on a long dUtance 
telephone call at the Waldorf-As- 
toria in New York City. What- 
ever took place in that interview 
at TTie Shoreham it was evident 
that their conference was a con- 
fidential one, and that a mutual 
understanding has been reached 
between them, resulting in a more 
genuine respect for each other’s 
sincere leadership. 

Mr. Pecson wields a powerful 
pen and who knows if someday 
he shall write about that hitherto 
unrevealed conference. It has 
been said that silent water runs 
deep. 






Washington — Sergio Osmena, new president of the exiled 
Philippine government, takes office with these announced purposes: 

1. To co-operate with American military men in every way 
possible toward the early liberation of hU homeland from the Jap- 
anese. 

2. To work for permanent freedom for the Ulands as an inde- 
pendent nation. 

An authoritative source said 
the Philippine resistance move- 
ment has long looked up to Os- 
mena as a strong and able friend. 

The 65 year old leader took the 
oath of office here in a hurriedly 
prepared ceremony only a few 
hours after President Manuel L. 
Quezon died at Saranac Lake, 
New York. 

Osmena’s wife and eleven of 
their twelve children arc still in 
the Philippines. One daughter, 
Maria, is in Washington. A pret- 
ty girl, she attended the cere- 
mony and will act as his hostess 
in any offidal entertaining. 

She was attending school here 
when the war broke. Osmena, 
then vice president, and Quezon 
escaped from Corregidor at about 
the time General MacArthur left 
the islands. 



New Antiseptic Said 
To Surpass Penicillin 

Sydney — War wounds in- 
fected with germs able to resist 
even sulpha drugs and penicillin 
may be cleaned by using mona- 
crin, according to Doctors Adrien 
Albert and S. D. Rubbo here. 
Tlie new antiseptic is declared 
to have successfully battled the 
most stubborn infections. 



Fossil Found 
2 Million Years Old 

A fossil recently discovered in 
southern Alameda county has 
been identified at the University 
of California as the skull cap and 
antlers of a four pronged ante- 
lope who lived during the Pleis- 
tocene age and has been extinct 
for 2,000,000 years. 

The fossil was found by Wes- 
ley Gordon, a Hayward city rec- 
reation director, who dug the 
bones out of a creek bank near 
Hayward during a rock-hunting 
tour with a group of boys. 

Dr. Chas L. Camp, head of the 
Paleontology department at U.C., 
and his assistant, Richard A. 
Ftirton, identified the fossil, 
which is said to be one of the 
finest specimens of its type ever 
uncovered. It has four prongs, 
two frontal and two rear, each 
approximately 10 inches high, 
which extend from the skull cap. 

Small fragments of similar ob- 
jects have been found in Texas, 
Nebraska and parts of California, 
but none of them approach the 
complement of this discovery. 

The specimen is now being re- 
stored at U. C. for display. 



D. Basil O’Connor 
Heads Red Cross 

Washington — President Roose- 
velt appointed D. Basil O’Con- 
nor, bead of the National Foun- 
dation for Infantile Ptralysis, as 
chairman of the central commit- 
tee of the American Red Cross to 
succeed the late Norman H. Da- 
vis. 

O’Connor, former New York 
law partner of Mr. Roosevelt, 
will serve the remainder of a 
term expiring December 1 1 this 
year. , 



25,000 Indians in 
Yank Forces 

Washington — About 23,000 
American Indians arc in the U- 
nited States armed forces, accord- 
ing to War Department figures. 

Surgeon Holds Heart 
Probes for Shrapnel 

Ottawa — A rare operation, 
during which an Army surgeon 
held a young infantry sergeant’s 
pulsating heart in one hand while 
he groped with the fingers of the 
other for a piece of shrapnel in 
the man’s pericardium — the tis- 
sue-like sack which enclosed the 
heart — was described in an Army 
statement. 

The piece of steel, weighing 
half an ounce, was located and 
removed, a wound in the heart 
was stitched, and the organ was 
replaced. 

The soldier walked out of the 
hospital three months later, com- 
pletely recovered. 



Argentina Begins 
To Make Planes 

Buenos Aires — Argentina has 
its first advanced training plane, 
constructed entirely of Argentine 
materials. 

Argentines hailed complctition 
of the plane as the first step to- 
wards recovering Argentina’s tra- 
ditional military supremacy in 
Soutli.»Amcrica. The machine is 
the first of a series planned by 
the army. 

age to enlighten and guide all 
the peoples of the world to the 
righteous path to morality, peace 
and good will, and the Brother- 
hood of Man.” 

"It is for Evaristo C. Pecson 
in his brief, but pointed book, 
‘OUR WORLD’ to bring out 
those spiritual needs from whence 
only can come the true Brother- 
hood -of Man, which is necessary 
before one can even think in 
terms of a brotherhood of na- 
tions. Pecson deals with the ways 
and means of attaining that po- 
litical Utopia which Willkie so 
earnestly seeks.”

Marines and Army foi-ces on

and bombs from carrier-based 
planes, rolled up new gains of 
from 2H to throe miles and over- 
ran four small towns as they 
pushed the remaining Japanese 
on the island into a trap at the 
northern end. 

The battle-toughened Marines 
who suffered heavy casualties at 
Saipan, rolled ashore on Tinian 
the morning of July 23. They 
drove quickly across the north- 
ern end of the Island to estab- 
lish a line from which they 
smashed southward with the sup- 
port of terrific gunfire from 
ground artillery and battleships, 
cruisers and destroyers, as well 
as aircraft.

were finally overwhelmed by the 
Marines on the beaches at the

were trapped.

The Filipino 
people should be 
informed how

Since this fellow traveler start-

are more divided than united, 
which is not at all surprising con-

You should remember when you

MANUEL LUIS QUEZON 

The Filipino people mourn the passing of the President 
of the Philippines, Manuel Luis Quezon. 

During his colorful career as the outstanding political 
leader of his country, Quezon had aroused the enmity of 
some of his contemporaries. We must not overlook the 
fact that all great men have many bitter enemies. 

But what counts most is the service that one has render- 
ed for the best interest and progress of his country and the 
world as a whole. There is no doubt that Quezon has con- 
tributed greatly to the advancement and upliftment of his 
people and his country. And for these the Filipino people 
shall always be grateful to him. 

Quezon’s death is a great loss to the freedom loving 
people of the world, especially to the people of the land that 
he loves and adores most, the Philippines. 



QUEZON 

The death of President Man- 
uel Luis Quezon of the Philip- 
pine Commonwealth is indeed a 
great .loss to the Philippines and 
its people. For over a quarter of 
a century. President Quezon has 
been in service to his country and 
his untimely death has brought 
bereavement to his people in the 
Philippines and abroad. 

To the family of the late Presi- 
dent, we send our deepest sym- 
pathy. 



Washington — The funeral ser- 
vices for the late President of the 
Philippines, His Excellency Man- 
uel L. Quezon, was held at St. 
Matthews Cathedral, Rhode Is- 
land and Connecticut Avenue, on 
Friday, August 4, at 9 A. M. 

The body of the late President 
arrived at Union Station Thurs- 
day where it was met by an Es- 
cort of Honor and conveyed to 
St. Matthews Cathedral. The 
Guard of Honor remained in at- 
tendance over night. 

Mass was said by His Excellen- 
cy, the Most Rev. John M. Mc- 
Namara, Auxiliary Bishop of 
Baltimore and Washington. The 
cortege proceeded under Metro- 
politan Police escort across Mem- 
orial Bridge where it was met by 
Army, Navy and Marine Escort 
of Honor. The* casket was trans- 
ferred to caisson and the cortege 
conducted to the crypt in Arling- 
ton National Cemetery for in- 
ternment. There was a 19-gun 
salute and flags at half staff at 
the ceremony of interment. All 
flags flown from staffs under the 
jurisdiction of the Military Dis- 
trict of Washington were flown 
at half staff from reveille until 



London — The German Trans- 
ocean News Agency broadcast a 
dispatch from Tokio that an A- 
merican agent had kept in con- 
stant touch with the United 
States and Australia by a radio 
station overlooking Manila Bay 
for nearly two years after Japan- 
ese occupation of the Philippines. 

The account from the German 
correspondent in Tokio said that 
a **large guerilla corps, headed 
by Blance Jurka, 53 year old 
Catholic missionary, has been dis- 
covered in the Philippines.” 

”One of the leaders,” the story 
said, ”was Charles Parson, an 
American who . . . established 
a clandestine radio station on 
Mindoro Island, overlooking Ma- 
nila Bay, and kept in constant 
touch with Australia and the

California Leads 



PRESIDENT OSMENA 

The Philippine Government-in-exile is headed by a 
new President whose executive ability is of the highest 
character and whose integrity is unquestioned. 

The people are confident that under his democratic 
leadership the Philippine Government-in-exile is under the 
guidance of a wise, just and experienced Chief Executive. 

We salute you. President Osmena of the Philippines. 



OSMENA 

We hope that President Ser- 
gio Osmena will carry on the 
good work of his office. By the 
time you read this column you 
have probably reorganized your 
personnel. We know that you will 
concern yourself for the immed- 
iate reconquest and rehabilita- 
tion of the Philippines after the 
invaders are driven away from 
the islands. We will need a strong 
army, navy and air force. We 
must learn the lesson of this 
World War II and let us not be 
fooled again by not building a 
very strong defense for our coun- 
try against our enemy. 

As our new President of the 
Philippines, we salute you! 



GOD is our refuge 
trouble — Psalm 46:1. 



OSMENA’S ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PASSING 
AWAY OF PRESIDENT MANUEL LUIS QUEZON 
AUGUST 1, 1944 

It is with a deep sense of sorrow and personal loss that 
I must give the sad news of the passing away of President 
Manuel L. Quezon of the Philippines. He died in Saranac 
Lake, N. Y. at 10:00 this morning, with Mrs. Quezon and 
his three children at his bedside. 

President Quezon’s death is a great loss to the freedom 
loving world. No champion of liberty fought for such a 
noble cause with more determination and against grater 
odds. His whole life was dedicated to the achievement of 
his people’s freedom, and it is one of the sad paradoxes of 
fate that with the forces of victory fast approaching the 
Philippines, he should pass away now and be deprived of 
seeing the culmination of his labors — the freedom of his 
people. 

To the Filipinos, President Quezon’s demise is a severe 
blow. No man has received more tokens of a people’s love 
and confidence than did Manuel L. Quezon at the hands of 
the Filipino people. His death will be taken in the Philip- 
pines as another terrible ordeal visited upon a nation already 
so sorely tried by a brutal invasion, and only Filipino cour- 
age and fortitude can blunt the poignant sorrow of so ir- 
reparable a loss. 

Manuel L. Quezon was my dear and beloved friend. 
Our friendship has stood the test of all political differences 
and has remained throughout whole and unimpaired. My 
attachment to him was rooted in that genuine friendship 
that has mellowed with the years into a real and abiding 
affection. He has gone to his reward, a valiant leader who 
will live forever in the hearts of his people. His memory 
will help me face the tasks that are ahead with the same 
patriotism with which he led us in our fight for freedom, 
and with the same devotion to the masses of our people 
which has characterized his administration as President of 
the Philippines. 

— Sergio Osmena 



FARM LABOR

A NEW SONG 

The new song entitled, ”I Hate 
To Leave You, Dear” by Salud 
Pecson and featured by her at 
a recent banquet in which hun-

heard it sung in public. 

It is the unanimous comment 
of the public that this timely 
song shall be one of the popular 
song hits.

Nation in Growth 



Second Year Straight 



. California continued to lead 
the Nation in population growth 
for the second consecutive year, 
with a 22.6 per cent gain for a 
total of 8,466,522 on July 1, 1943, 
the Bureau of Census announced 
officially in Washington. 

Unofficial estimates by other 
private and public agencies have 
indicated the increased rate con- 
tinued without interruption to the 
present time, bringing the State’s 
population near the 10,000,000 
mark. 



Total population of the United 
States a year ago, excluding mem- 
be rs of the armed forces over- 
seas, was 133,942,410, as compar- 
ed with 131,669,275 on April 1, 
1940, according to the bureau re- 
port. The Nation has 3,600,000 
soldiers overseas in addition to 
naval and marine personnel. 

While California led. the Na- 
tion in population growth. New 
York headed the list of States 
undergoing a population decrease 
with the migration estimated at 
630,939 persons. Other States 
which lost population included 
Kansas, Montana and Idaho. 
Gains were registered also by 
Wyoming, Colorado, New Mex- 
ico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, 
Washington and Oregon. 

The increases during the 12 
months covered in the report 
ranged from 2164 for New Mex- 
ico to California’s 1,559,135.

reported that the good Doctor 
Macario D. Bautista (M. D.), 
A. Cruz, A. Gonzales (incum-

Why don’t Doc Imperial, Doc

put on the presidential ballot? 
It would be very interesting, in- 
deed, to see how many votes this 
trio would receive.

LAID TO REST 



Manuel Luis Quezon was laid 
to rest in the Arlington National 
Cemetery across the Potomac 
from Washington, on August 4, 
in an impressive funeral cere- 
mony. The late President of the 
Philipines was accorded a 19 gun 
salute, befitting a man of high 
office as the head of a state. 

May he rest in peace. 



BACK TO farm 



There is a movement among 
the Filipinos in big cities to go 
out into the rural districts and 
work in the rich agricultural sect- 
ions of California. 

The need for Filipino farm la- 
bor throughout the Pacific states 
is great for the farmers realize 
that the natives are the best farm 
workers.

BUSINESS 



Since the outbreak of the war 
in the Pacific, the number of 
Filipino businessmen in the small-; 
er cities and towns have increased *i 
three-fold. 

Aside from the ordinary busi- 
nessmen of managing restaurants 
cafes, photo studios, barber shops 
bars, bath houses, etc., they are 
now engaged in the dry-goods 
stores, hotel management and 
moving picture displays. 

Filipino farmers and produce 
merchants have increased ten- 
fold and are making good at it. 
They are producing essential 
foods for our fighting forces and 
for the home front. 

All of these businessmen have 
been very cooperative in backing 
the' war effort, promoting more 
sales in war bonds and donations 
to war charities. 



The late President Manuel Luis Quezon was present at the meetings of the Pacific War Council, attended by the 
heads of three other United Nations. President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States; Prime Minister Winston 
Churchill of Great Britan; and Prime MinistcrMac Kenzie King of Canada. The Council reportedly mapped strat- 
egy against the Japanese. Left to right are G. S. Cox of New 2^aland, T. V. Soong of China, Lord Halifax of 
Great Britain, Herbert Bvatt of Australia, Mr. Churchill, President Roosevelt, Mr. King, Lei^ton McCarthy of 
Canada, A. London of the Netherlands and the late President Quezon. 



WARM HOSPITALITY 

It has been this writer’s unfor- 
gettable moments to have visited 
the private residence of Mr. E. 
C. Pecson and family on 409 S. 
J Street, Lompoc, California, and 
was very much impressed by 
their kindness and warm hospi- 
tality. 

While in their comfortable and 
cozy home one feels leisurely at 
ease, enjoyiilg the freshly cut ex- 
pansive green lawn bordered by 
a variety of well selected roses 
and assorted flowering plants, in- 
cluding three Camellias of diff- 
erent varieties. 

By the way, Lompoc, is a valley 
city of 7,000 population nine 
miles from the ocean. It has one 
of the most pleasant climates in 
the state and is known as the 
”Flower Capital” of the country.

NEW GUAM GAINS 

Marines and Army forces on 
Guam, supported by rocket-fire 
and bombs from carrier-based 
planes, rolled up new gains of 
from 2H to three miles and over- 
ran four small towms as they 
pushed the remaining Japanese 
on the island into a trap at the 
northern end. 

The battle-toughened Marines 
who suffered heavy casualties at 
Saipan, rolled ashore on Tinian 
the morning of July 23. They 
drove quickly across the north- 
ern end of the island to estab- 
lish a line from which they 
smashed southward with the sup- 
port of terrific gunfire from 
ground artillery and battleships, 
cruisers and destroyers, as well 
as aircraft. 

After repulsing final Japanese 
counter-attacks Sunday night in 
which at least 300 of the enemy 
died, the Marines drove the Jap- 
anese into a long, narrow pocket 
along the southwestern coast 
where they had no alternative 
but surrender or fight to the 
death. 

GIVES NO DETAILS 

Nimitz, in a brief communique, 
gave no details of the final op- 
erations on Tinian, but it ap- 
peared likely that the few Jap- 
anese who survived the U. S. 
ground offensive and the batter- 
ing of heavy guns and bombs 
were finally overwhelmed by the 
Marines on the beaches at the 
end of the island where they 
were trapped. 

The smashing drive on Guam 
straightened out the new Ameri- 
can line across the island which 
was established Sunday in a clas- 
sic operation in which the U. S. 
forces si4’ept to the east coast 
With the entire southern half 
of Guam already under Ameri- 
can control, th U, S. troops were 
pushing out on the flat plateaus 
at the northern end. The com-

Book Reviews of "OUR WORLD 






**The little volume is worth reading, particular- 
ly as it shows the point of view of a sincere, well 
educated native of the Philippines, one who has 
come to the United States, but one who feels, 
intensely, that there should be no racial discrimi- 
nation among civilized peoples.” 



"LOS ANGELES EVENING HERALD and 
EXPRESS” 



*^t is for Evaristo C. Pecson in his brief, but 
pointed book, "Our World” to bring out those 
spiritual needs from whence can come the true 
Brotherhood of Man, which is necessary before 
one can even think in terms of a brotherhood of 
nations. Pecson deals with the ways and means 
of attaining that political Utopia which Willkie 
so earnestly seeks. 



"You will like Pecson’s book, whether in com- 
plete agreement with every thought, for its direct, 
simple approach to the greatest of all problems — 
that of making our world worthy of living in, 
worthy of saving.” 

"STOCKTON DAILY RECORD” 



"Mr. Pecson’s book is timely: it carries a mes- 
sage of hope that should appeal to all sober 
thinking people. It is a ray of light in our world 
darkened with the horrors of thb mighty con- 
flict between right and wrong.”

SUPREME HEADQUARTERS, LONDON 
•(UP). — Onrushing American armored forces 
rolled into Brittany Monday and suddenly swerved east- 
ward toward Paris in a 10-miIe surge on a 10-mile front, 
threatening to box up the entire German line in France, 

as a spokesman called the 
day’s developments “the most 
important of the invasion.” 
British troops driving into 
the center of the German line 
captured important Le Beny-Bo- 
cage, deepening their wedge to 
II miles and advancing within 
five miles of the big German de- 
fense base of Vire. Canadian 
forces jsimultancously opened a 
powerful attack against the last 
intact section- of the front — the 
stubbornly defended hills and 
hedgerows southeast of Caen on 
the cast flank. 

Behind the rampaging Ameri- 
can armor, infantrymen wiped 
uiU ■‘he. last remQaiKts>o£ oewu 
German divisions, victims of one 
whirlwind week of American of- 
fensive power. Preliminary Ger- 
man losses were placed at more 
than 23,000 captured or killed, 
but the count was only begin- 
ning. 

SEIZE 2 DAMS 
Striking south, then east from 
Avranches at the foot of the Nor- 
man peninsula, the Americans 
nipped any German efforts to 
flood the low-lying See-Selune es- 
tuary area by seizing the sluice 
gates of two important dams on 
the Selune. One was taken in a 
10-miIe thrust southeast of Av- 
ranches which resulted in the 
capture of Vezina. 

.Another armored column 
smashed into Montgothier, eight 
miles east-southeast of Avran- 
ches, and still another drove 10 
miles to capture the big town 
of Brecey, east-northeast of Av- 
ranches, as the swing toward the 
heart of France developed on a 
wide front. 

Already the Americans from 
Avranches were within 20 miles 
of a junction with the British 
from Le Beny-Bocage, which not 
only would break the last bonds 
of the Normandy bottleneck but 
might trap the large German 
forces now within the gap. 

The British were driving on be- 
.yond Le Beny, and United Press 
Correspondent Samuel D. Hales 
reported from the 'front that 
their drive "shows no signs of 
diminishing." 

GERMANS RETREAT 
Confronted with the massive 
drives on their flanks, German 
forces which had been counter- 
attacking in a salient based on 
Percy, Tessy and Villedleu-Les

Volunteer Sailors 
Aid In Recovering 
Blast Victim's Bodies 

The untiring work of the Val- 
lejo unit, U. S. Coast Guard Aux- 
iliary in aiding patrol work off 
Port Chicago foUouIng the re- 
cent disastrous explosion has re- 
ceived special commendation 
from Rear Admiral Carlton H. 
Wright, UJS.N., commandant of 
the 12th Nava] District. 

Boats and members of the Val- 
lepo flotilla aided in patrol work 
and recovering bodies of victims 
from Monday, July 24, the night 
of the blast, until the following 
'Thursday morning at 10 o’clock 
when they were relieved of fur- 
ther duty. 

A check by Coast Guard au- 
thorities yesterday revealed that 
a total of 62 bodies have ^o 
far been recovered as a result 
of the combined Mat-; island na- 
val and U. S. CToast Guard and 
Auxiliary patrols. There were 
388 lives lost, according to Navy 
announcements. 

W’ERE ENLISTED MEN 

Most of the recovered bodies 
being those of Navy enlisted men 
were taken to Port Chicago 
where a senior naval medical of- 
ficer has been in charge. From 
there they were taken to Mare 
Island or if next of kin was pres- 
ent, were turned over to relatives, 
it was disclosed. 

None of the 62 bodies recov- 
ered was that of a Vallejo man. 

Boats and personnel of the 
U. S. Coast Guard Auxiliary Flo- 
tilla No. 25, stationed at Vallejo, 
taking part included: 

Officers. Comdr. Frank *E, 
Johnston; vice-commander, Wil- 
liam Collins, commanding offi- 
cers; 

Boat officers: CGA 2502, owned 
by Comdr. Johnston, and his 
crew, Albert Haynes and Robert 
Cowin. 

Boat No. 2509: Commanded by 
Jr. Comdr. Frank . Shelley, and 
his crew, R. Crowe. 

Boat No. 2504: C;k)mmanded by 
Ken Warner of Vallejo, and his 
crew, Charles Buricholder, small 
boat officer in the flotilla. 

Boat CGA 25, commander by 
Herbert Samuels, with his crew 
Ben Lewis, enlisting officer of 
the flotilla. 

CGA 25119, under Jack Can- 
non. his crew, William Collins, 
vice-commander of the unit. 

Contact by the officials and 
the flotilla was maintained by 
J. R. Greig, senior shop super- 
intendent, Mare Island navy 
yard, who was liaison officer of 
the floUlla. 



WASHINGTON (UP)— Author- 
itative iiources disclosed last 
night that stoaks and roo.sU from 
utility grades of beef will be 
made ration-free beginning Au- 
gust 13, but that hams and pork 
loins will be returned to the ra- 
tion list. 

These sources said that by Sep- 
tember 1 steaks and roasts from 
the better commercial grade of 
beef also will be made point-free. 

Removal of the utility’ and com- 
mercial grades of beef from the 
ration list would make point-free 
virtually all steaks and roasts 
now available to consumers inas- 
much as the two remaining 
grades that still would be ratlon- 



<*d — choice and good grades — 
rarely reach retail butcher shops. 
Nearly all of the supply of the 
latter two grades goes either to 
the military or to restaurants 
and hotels. 

The decision to remove utility 
beef from the ration list and re- 
turn point values to the two pork 
products came with the settle- 
ment of a rationing dispute be- 
tween the War Foo<l AdmlnLstra> 
tlon and the Office of Price Ad- 
ministration. *■ 

The WFA last month ordered 
the OPA to reniove both commer- 
cial and utility grades of beef 
from rationing and restore points 
on the pork Items on August 1.

PIULADELPHIA (AP)t— Ne- 
groes and white men fought last 
night in a flareup of race dis- 
order in the wake of a complete 
tie-up of Philadelphia's public 
transportation system, and as 
the night wore on, police cars 
raced almost continuously from 
one disturbance to another. 

One seven-block section north 
of the central city area was cov- 
ered with broken glass from milk 
bottles hurled at autos and police 
cars, and store and house win- 
dows were -broken m many sec- 
tions of norih and south Phila- 
dephia. 

The first disturbance occurred 
in the Ridge avenue section, 
northwest of the center o^ the 
city. 

Judge Harry S. McDevitt. di- 
rector of the Philadelphia Civil- 
ian Defense Council, went to the 
scene and directed 250 traffic and 
motorcycle policemen and auxil- 
iary police in restoring order in 
a two block area. 

The first disturbance occurred 
when two white men in a car 
stopped at a traffic signal. Spec- 
tators said a giT)up of negroes 
dragged them from the car and 
beat them. They escaped and 
drove away. 

The second incident took place 
an hour and a half later at an 
intersection where a negro lodge 
carnival was in progress. There,

Vallejo Mourns Quezon’s Death 



By JUAN B. SARMIENTO 

The d(jath of President Manuel 
L. Quezon of the Philippines in 
Saranac Lake, N. Y., yesterday 
closed an absorbing chapter in 
the history of American-Filipino 
relations. 

Quezon’s place in Philippine 
history is secured; his is second 
only to that of Rizal’s. 

Like those of Rizal’s, the life 
and deeds of Manuel L. Quezon 
will serve as an unending source

of inspiration to his people, in 
whote hearts his name will for- 
ever be enshrined. 

Quezon’s political career was 
both brilliant and colorful. He 
was a fighter for the cause of 
his people — their independence. 
It was— in large measure— his 
efforts that made possible the 
enactment into law of the Tyd- 
ings-McDuffie Act which estab- 
lished the Commonwealth of the 
Philippines in 1935. 

Que^n was the man the Phil- 
ippines could least spare. He 
had the confidence of his people. 

He was the symbol of a great 
cause. 

In his passing the common 
"tao" has lost a kinsman.

.Manuel L. Quezon was a dy- 
namic speaker; he spoke flu- 
ently in Spanish and English, 
and also in his native dialect, 
'Tagalog. 

He was the best friend Amer- 
ica ever had. When conditions 
in the far east became serious 
and the Filipinos decided to cast 
their -lot with America, it was 
President Quezon who said that 
the Philippines would stand with 
the United States in life and in 
death. * 

It had since then become a 
reality. In the batUe of the 
Philippines, Americans and Rli- 
pinos fought side by side against 
the Japanese.

President Quezon was planning 
to visit Vallejo last year. 

In a resolution, signed by hun- 
dreds of Filipinos in Solano 
county, inviting ih^ident (Que- 
zon to visit Vallejo, the Filipinos 
said the thought that their once

evacuated even a.s water rose 
into the beach hotels and cot- 
tages. 

The weather bureau announced 
at 10 p. m. the storm had passed 
inland, and at that time the 
winds were gradually diminish- 
ing over the debris-strewn and 
tree-littered city. 

At 10 p. m., advisory issued 
by the Miali, Fla., weather bu- 
reau said the storm was attend- 
ed by winds of 80 miles an hour 
over a small area, but the center 
of the storm appeared to have 
passed inland slightly south of 
here, and Wilmington did not 
feel its full force. 

The advisory said the storm 
would continue to move north- 
northwestward and gradually di- 
minish in intensity. Gales, how- 
ever, continued over eastern 
North Carolina last night and di- 
minished today, it added. 

At the height of the storm, 
with refugees crowding hotel lob- 
bies and every available housing 
space, the city had a 30-minute 
power failure and was plunged 
into darkness. Every block of 
the city’s streets was littered 
with fallen trees and debris. 

While mountainous waves 
whipped the boardwalks at 
Wrightsrille and Carolinas beach- 
es, and water went over the 
bridges on the only roads lead- 
ing from the resorts. Coast 
Guaixlsmen and details from 
Camp Da\1s, nearby anti-aircraft 
training center, evacuated thou- 
sands of persons, mostly women 
and children. 

Wilmington, normally a city of 
about 40,000, has a war-swollen 
population twice as large, and 
the evacuees presented a serious 
housing and feeding probl^n. 
Lines of homeless trying to get 
Into hotel lobbies formed on the 
streets for several blocks los^. 

Appeals were made to private 
home owners and two large con- 
voys of refugees w’ere taken to 
CJajnp Davis for shelter. 

Authorities said that they had 
evacuated everyone they could 
find from the beaches. So far 
no loss of life has been reported, 
but no complete check could be 
made immediately. Several ^torm 
casualties were in local hospitals. 

The wind reached a velocity of 
60 M.P.H. at about 9 p. m., and 
a lull followed. The hard wind 
began blowing at about 6:30 
while the beaches were being I 
cleared. I 

At that time a deluge of rain j 
swept the city. Radio stations * 
went out- of commission, and tele - 1 
phone and telegraph wires began * 
failing fast. At 10 p. m. wires 
were still dowm to Southport, a 1 
coastal town 25 miles south of 
here.

Germans Pul Torch To 
Warsaw As Red Army 
Assaults Suburbs 

LONDON (Wednesday) (AP) 
— ^The Russian First Baltic Army 
drove to the Baltic sea yesterday, 
Isolating two German armies of 

150.000 men each in Estonia and 
Latvia, while two other powerful 
Soviet army groups captured, 
Kaunas, pre-war capital of Lithu- 
ania, and closed a steel arc of 
siege around burning Warsaw. 

The Baltic trap was closed by 
Gen. Ivan C. Bagramian’s men, 
who seized 'Tukums, rail center 
nine miles south of the gulf of 
Riga and 30 miles almost due 
west of the city of Riga, and used 
it for a base to drive on to the 
gulf, cutting the last overland 
communications of any sort be- 
tween E)ast Prussia and the 
noj^h Paltlc states. 

Six other railway stations were 
among more than 100 towns 
taken in pressing home the Red 
wedge, the Soviet midnight com- 
munique announced, describing 
the threat of German catastro- 
phe in a single sentence; 

"Thus our troops have cut all 
roads leading from the Baltic to 
East Pl'ussla." 

How many Germans remain In 
the Baltic states is uncertain, 
but their numbers are believed 
to be large. Both the 16th and 
the 18th armies, once totalling 

350.000 men, were assigned to the 
Estonia-Latvian defense, and had 
given no indications of pulling 
out even as their escape routes 
narrowed daily. 

Fish Wins In

Rep. Fish (Rep.-N.Y.) won re- 
nomination over the opposition 
of Gov. Thomas E Dewey and

Senator Clark (Denri.-Mo.) trailed 
in early returns from primary

Fish expressed gratitude for

Men 25 and under, including

quarters officers said. Eighteen- 
year-olds will continue to make 
up a substantial proportion of 
draft calls, but the remainder 
must be made up partially of 
men over 25, it was said. 

A directive from national head- 
quarters received today empha- 
sizes that men in the 26 to 29 
year group must hold necessary 
jobs in essential civilian or war 
industry to obtain deferment, it 
was said. Men 30 and over must

Finns Move 
To End War 

STOl^KHOLM (UP) — Presi-

signed today and within four 
hours the Finnish parliament 
held five secret sessions adopt- 
ing a decree naming as his suc- 
cessor 77-year-old Field Marshal 
Baron Carl Gustaf Mannerheim, 
who will take office Friday. 

The sudden action was in- 
terpreted here as meaning that 
Mannerheim again had been 
named dictator of his country 
In a time of crisis, and it was 
believed that the ultimate aim 
of the drastic changes must be 
a new attempt at making peace 
with Russia. 



Blast Damage Claims 



While the navy in Vallejo took 
steps yesterday to accept claims 
for damage to real and personal 
property occasioned by the blast 
at Port Chicago which claimed 
over 300 lives on July 17. Repre- 
sentative C::arter, in Washington 
moved to introduce a separate bill 
which will insure payment of any 
damages. 

The nav>’ announced that it 
will receive claims only up to 
August 17 at the Bay Point 
School House, Port Chicago, if 
made in person or, if by mail, 
U. S. Naval Board of Investiga- 
tion, Port Chicago. 

For the convenience of the pub- 
lic, representatives of the navy 
will be present at the post office 
in Vallejo, Benicia, Fairfield and 
other communities which were 
damaged by the blast on Friday 



and Saturday from noon to 4 p.m. 
and from 5 p. m to 9 p. m. 

In Washington, however, Rep. 
Carter proposed that the claims 
could be submitted, in writing, 
to the navy within six months 
after the bill’s enactment and al- 
so called for a thorough Investi- 
gation by the navy of all claims 
against the United States for per- 
sonal injuries, death of property { 
damage.

The plt)posed legislation covers 
cases which cannot be equitably' 
settled under existing laws. 



(hat island into a death trap 
The conquest of Tinian island 
came Monday night after the 
Second and Fourth Marine 

dlvlKloiiK had cniKhed emBtny 
forces In a llglitnlng nweep acroiiB 
the Island which took a toll of 
at. least 2389 Japanese livp.n 

The Marine divisions — conquer- 
ors of Saipan— continued their 
moppIng-up operation on the is- 
land, Nimitz revealed in his third 
communique of the day, but the 
Japanese, who had been battered 
by some of the heaviest aerial 
and naval bombardment* of the 
Pacific war <x?ajred orgoiii^d n-

NEW’ GUA.M GAINS 

Marines and Army forces on 
Guam, supported by rocket-fire 
and bombs from carrier-based 
planes, rolled up new gains of 
from 2% to three miles and over- 
ran four small towns as they 
pushed the remaining Japanese 
on the island into a trap at the 
northern end. 

The battle-toughened Marines 
who suffered heavy casualties at 
Saipan, rolled ashore on Tinian 
the morning of July 23. They 
drove quickly across the north- 
ern end of the island to estab- 
lish a line from which they 
smashed southward with the sup- 
port of terrific gunfire from 
ground artillery and battleships, 
cruisers and destroyers, as well 
as aircraft. 

After repulsing final Japanese 
counter-attacks Sunday night in 
which at least 300 of the enemy 
died, the Marines drove the Jap- 
anese into a long, narrow pocket 
along the southwestern coast 
where they had no alternative 
but surrender or fight to the 
death. 

GI\’ES NO DETAILS 

Nimitz, in a brief communique, 
gave no details of the final op- 
erations on Tinian, but it ap- 
peared likely that the few Jap- 
anese who survived the U. S. 
ground offensive and the batter- 
ing of heavy guns and bombs 
were finally overwhelmed by the 
Marines on the beaches at the 
end of the island where they 
wore trapped. 

The smashing drive on Guam 
straightened out the new Ameri- 
can line across the island which 
was established Sunday in a clas- 
sic 9 peration in which the U. S. 
forces swept to the east coast. 

With the entire southern half 
of Guam already under Ameri- 
can control, th U. S. troops were 
pushing out on the flat plateaus 
at the northern end. The com- 
paratively flat, brush - covered 
area, broken only by 870-foot

fought their way into the streets 
of all three towns and their swift 
capture seemed assured. 

The 11:30 p. m. Allied commu- 
nique announced that British 
troops had cap\ured Le Beny-Bo- 
cage, 17 miles southeast of St. 
Lo, and that the yanks had seized 
control of the See-Selune river 
system by capturing dams 10 
miles southeast of Avranches. 

American Negro truck drivers, 
armed with battle knives the size 
of butcher's blades, and Yank 
Commandos carrying piano-wire 
garrots were pressed into service 
as ambush parties along the Ger- 
man lines of retreat, front dis- 
patches said. 

The escape of any Germans be- 
tween the American coast flank 



and the British spearhead in the 
center was growing problemati- 
cal as the Yanks drove south of 
Avranches across the Selune 
river, then struck east-northeast 
and swepjt into Brecey, 10 miles 
inland from the fallen port city 
at the base of the Norman cape. 

This armored spearhead now 
was only 20 miles away from a 
junction with British troops who 
crossed the Souleuvre river at 
Le Beny-Bocage, 17 miles south- 
east of St! Lo, and the focal 
point of l[)Oth drives was the Im-

About one-fifth of the total pro-

Philadelphia 



(Continued from Page 1) 
police said, two other white men 
were dragged from a coal truck 
and beaten. The coal was scat- 
tered. 

Judge McDevitt ordered the 
carnival closed and directed the 
police in dispersing the crowd. 

The transportation walkout, de- 
priving 1,500,000 persons of their 
normal means of urban travel, 
was still in progress last night, 
after trolley, bus and subway 
employes had listened in silence

this morning. 



Fear 17 Fliers 



Killed In Crash 



M U R O C (INS) — Seventeen 
fliers were believed to have been 
kUled yesterday in a mid-air col- 
lision of two B*24 Liberator 
bombers 12 miles southwest of 
Furness Creek Inn. 

Col. Gerald Hoyle, command- 
ing officer of Muroc Army Air- 
field, said that the wreckage of 
the two planes, which had been 
on a combat training mission, 
had been spotted from the air. 

He said no further information 
W'ould be available until rescue 
crew’s reached the scene of the 
accident which Is in the heart of 
Death Valley, 



SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-The 
state supreme court granted a 
new trial yesterday to a 17-year- 
old Los Angeles negro who it 
said had been beaten unmerciful- 
ly by police to make him confess 

to murder. 

The court delivered a scorching 
opinioh on Los Angeles and San 
Diego police methods in obtain- 
ing confessions. 

“L a w enforcement officers 
must understand," the court said, 
“that the rights of persons sus- 
pected of a crime must be re- 
spected." 

The young negro, Preston S. 
Jones, was arrested in Los An- 
geles and returned to San Diego 
on suspicions of murder in the 



killing October 5, 1942, of 
Din Toy, a Chinese, in a aj 
Diego hotel. He received a fe 
sentence. (Jharles I. Baa, ^ 
convicted of murder, was 
fenced to death. 



The court said young Joq 

was beaten twice a day for] 

least four days by Los Angei 
and San Diego police.

Police Department Annual 



Report Shows Decrease In 



Vallejo Crime During Year 



A definite decrease in irinie In Vallejo this year over last 
year was reported by Chiefj of Police Earl Dierking to Commis- 
sioner Andrew Sheveland ana the city council yesterday when the 
police department’s annual report was filed. Dierking listed 2232 
persons being charged with crimes in the 1943-41 fiscal year, while 
during 1942-43 there were 2877<^^ 
persons accused. j 



Crimes of vlalence and other 
major crimes decreased by only 
two, while the greatest decrease 
was noted in minor offenses, 
which saw 643 fewer persons ar- 
rested. 

Perhaps attributable to the 
liquor shortage and the skjTock- 
eting bar prices, drunkenness de- 
creased n^asurably, Dierking re- 
ported. with 847 being charge<l 
during the past year while 1287 
were charged in the 1942-43 per- 
iod. 

The report also indicated that 
Vallejoans think more of their 
automobiles now that they can’t 
get new ones, with 19 being 
charged with stealing automo- 
biles W’hile 34 were charged in 
the last period. 

There were two persons charg- 
ed with murder, both growing 
out of shootings in lower Geor- 
gia street. They were tjie Astley 
case and the Daniels case. In 
1942-13 two w'ere charged with 
murder.

War Production Chiefs 
Tackle Production Slump 



'Dumbo' Pilots 
Save Many U. S 
Fliers In Pacific 



WASHINGTON iINS)— High 
WaBhington officials tackled the 
problem of speeding up w'ar pro- 
duction yesterday paced by a 
warning from Lt Gen. Brehon 
Somervell that unless current 
lags in output of essential w'eap- 
ons and materials are overcome 
by emergency action the w'ar tem- 
po w'ill be slowed. 

Most significant of the day's 

production developments was a 

White House conference called 

• 

by War Mobllizer James F. 
Byrnes at which w'ar material 
shortages, manpower shortages 
and the premature shift of labor 
from essential to non-essential 
work w’ere among problems dis- 
cussed. 

Byrnes summoned top war 
agency and military and naval 

men, including Somervell, who is 
chief of the army’s service forces, 
to go over the situation. 

Others present included Don- 
ald M. Nelson, chairman, and 
Charles E. Wilson, executive vice- 
chairman of the War Production 
Board; Charles M. Hay, deputy 
director of the War Manpower 
Commission, representing WMC 



Commissioner Paul V. McNutt: 
Brig. Gen. Lucius Clay of the 
Army Serxice of Supply; and 
Vice Admiral S. M. Robinson, of 
the Navy procurement and sup- 
ply office. 

\Vllson as chairman of the Air- 
craft Production Board announc- 
ed that July plane output drop^ 
ped -199 below schedule, totaling 
8000 units, compared to 8049 

planes turned out in June. 

Wilson attributed the drop 
from schedule to the July 4 holi- 
day W’hen a large number of air- 
craft workers failed to show up 
and when part of the industry 
took inventory and changed pro 
cedures. 



SAN FRANCISCO (UP)— Na- 
val pilots of "dumbo" missions 
are picking downed pilots out of 
the Pacific "faster than they can 
get a taxicab in New York," 12th 
Naval District headquarters said 
yesterday. 

A "dumbo" Is a rescue mission, 
and it has become a major task 
on the Pacific front line, head- 
quarters said, revtf'aling that pa- 
trol squadrons 14 and 53 have 
rescued a total of 79 army, navy 
and marine aviation personnel 
shot or forced down In the Pa- 
cific.

Wash., former grid star and later 
assistant football coach at the 
University of Washington, wears

ing to rescue ^ down army avia- 



At noon tomorrow launching 
ceremonies will be held on Mare 
Island for the latest in an im- 
pressive list of Mare Island- 
built submarines, the U. S. S.

Navy Yard Commandant Ad- 
miral Mahlon S. Tisdale and Ad- 
miral Carleton H. Wright, com- 
mandant of the 12th Naval Dis- 
trict, will divide the honors as 
co-spealcens on the dedicatory 
program. 

Mr^. Tisdale xxill sponsor the 
new submarine and her daugh- 
tenj Mrs. Kenneth Sanger, will 
be matron of honor. Mi's. Sanger 
is visiting her parents at Mare 
Island while her husband, Com- 
mander Sanger, is on active duty 
in the Pacific. 



PHILADELPHIA (AP).^ — 'TyoUey, bus and subway employcN 
listened to Army and Navy picas In silence yesterday, then booed 
down their own union officers begging them to end a sudden work 
stoppage that shut down Philadelphia’s public transportation sys- 
tem, which normally carries 1,500,000 riders daily. Every vehicle 
of tlio Philadelphia Transporta 
tlon company was at a standstill, 
and Army and Navy officers de- 
dared that war production^ W'as 
neliig retarded seriously in the 
cost Phlladelphla-Camden arsen- 
al area. 

'The Transport Workers Union 
(CIO) contended that the tie-up 
was Instigated by enemy agnets 
with the aim of inciting race riots 
and stalling war production, 
while the company claimed the 
men were protesting the hiring 
of Negro operators. 

WORKERS STRANDED 

Hundreds of thousands of 
workers were left stranded on 
street corners yesterday morn- 
ing, and other thousands who 
reached their jobs before the sub- 
way-elevated lines ceased opera- 
tions sought desperately for 
means of returning home last 
night. 

The Office of W'ar Information 
hero said 72 per cent of the Phil-

SACRAMENTO (UP) — The 
federal government now "fully 
ocupics the field" so far as con- 
struction and operation of .the 
Central Valley Project Is concern- 
ed, Edward Hyatt, state engineer, 
yesterday told a meeting of the 
State Water Project Authority, 
in rolcasing his answers to a ser- 
ies of questions by the Irrigation 
Districts’ Association of Califor- 
nia. 

Hyatt said that provisions of 
the Califoniia Central Valley 
Project act imposed no legal lim- 
its on the federal government 
procedure in respect to the proj- 
ect and that there was no con- 
tract in force between the govern- 
ment and the sta,te authority re- 
lating to the projec'c and two pre- 
vious contracts calling for even- 
tual state operation of the project 
had lapsed. 



investigation indicated epemy 
activity. 

The Philadelphia Transporta- 
tion company, operator of the 
line^ had said it believed the 
6000 bus, trolly and subway driv- 
ers and maintenance men quit 
because Negro operators had 
been hired. 

Reports of race triiuble spread 
through the city and after one 
minor skirmish developed be- 
tween whites and negn*oes Mayor 
Bernard Samuel ordered all 
establishments selling beer, wines 
and liquor to stop sales immedi- 
ately, Similar orders went out 
from the state liquor control 
commission to all state-operated 
retail liquor stores in Philadel- 
phia county. 

The drivers themselves ascrib- 
ed their layoffs to "illness."

HOLLYWOOD (INS).— Esther 
W’ i 1 1 i a m s, former swimming

vealed yesterday that she and 
her husband, Dr. Leonard Kov- 
ner, have been separated for 
three weeks. Plans for a divorce 
are pending, she said. They were 
married in 1940. 

Before the war, Japan was one

Promotion Of 
Stilwell Hints 
Early Offensive 

WASHINGTON (UP). — An 
early Allied major offensive In 
southeast Asia was foreseen yes- 
terday with the nomination of 
Lt. Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell, com- 
mander of U. S. forces in the 
(Thina-Burma-India theater, to a 
full general. 

Stllwell’s promotion, recom- 
mended by President Roosevelt 
and submitted to the Senate for 
approval, followed London an- 
nouncement that Admiral Sir 
Bruce A. Fraser— one of Brit- 
ain’s outstanding naval leaders 
— has been transferred from com- 
mand of the British home fleet 
to command of the eastern fleet. 

The nomination, which will 
give the Army six full generals 
on active duty, served to magni- 
fy the Importance of the China 
theater. It underscored the in- 
creasing importance attached to 
the w’ar in China, the necessity 
of preventing Japan from knock- 
ing that country out of the w'ar 
and the need for utilizing China’s 
tremendous manpower potential. 

Stilwell, operating at the start 
on virtually a shoestring, is giv- 
en much of the credit for keep- 
ing China in the war to date. 
His promotion is calculated to 
give the embattled C:!hinese a tre- 
mendous phychological “lift,” 
since they look to him as a sym- 
bol of American help in their 
long fight against Japan.

A NEVER TO SE FOROOTTEN 
THEATRE EXPERIENCE 



(rcne Kelly Is one of Holly 
wood’s most rapidly ascending 
stars today because he wasn’t 
afraid to take a setback, In or- 
der to prove that he could do 
more than one thing. 

Before migrating to the film 
colony, Kelly scored a sensation- 
al hit as a dancer In the New 
York theatre. It was his nRnble 
feet which netted him a movie 
And his first appear- 1

contract 
ance before the camera was as a 
dancer. 

After completion of that pic- 
ture, and while Gene was being 
acclaimed a brilliant newcomer, 
he made his first venturesome 
decision. 

He walked into the office of the 
studio’s top executive and asked 
for a straight acting role In 

“Pilot No. 6.” 

* 

“But, Gene, you don’t want to 
be In that — it’s just an ordinary 
program picture. We have much 
better plans for you. Why, you’re 
as good a dancer as Fred As- 
taire,’’ said the studio boss. 

But Kelly stuck to his guns. 
Whether “Pilot No. 5” was im- 
portant or not, he wanted to be 
in it 

“I knew that If I made one 
more musical. I’d be typed for- 
ever,’’ says the actor. “Nobody 
would ever give me a chance at 
a straight acting role. And I 
knew that I had to prove I 
could act, if my residence in 
Hollywood was to be perma- 
nent" 

As things turned out it is evi- 
dent that Kelly showed wisdom 
in his volunteering to play a sup- 
porting role in a small picture 
in order to prove that he could 
act 

Had he not done so, he never 
would have been sonsidered for 
his latest role — co-starring oppo-

INDEPENDENCE, Mo. (INS). 
— Senator Harry S. ’Truman, 
Democratic vice presidential nom- 
inee, prepared to leave for Wash- 
ington yesterday for a confer- 
ence Thursday with his war in- 
vestigating committee, and with 
Robert Hannegan, chairman of 
th Democratic national commit- 
tee. 

Senator Truman said he was 
“very pleased’’ with the sugges- 
tion by Republican Senator Har- 
old Burton that he be retained 
on the committee. Truman added, 
however, that he stDl' feels he 
ought to resign. 

‘The w'ork of the committee 
Is too important to get ihvoh'ed 
or hampered by a political cam- 
paign." ’Truman said. He added, 
how’ever, that he “will do what 
the Senate wants me to do,’’ 

’Truman cast his vote in the 
311ssouri primary yesterday aft- 
ernoon and spent the rest of the 
day with his family before leav- 
ing for Washington last night

ly attended. 

But the lines of future debate 
were clearly drawn by two de- 
velopments: 

1. Senator George (D-Ga.), fi- 
nance committee chairman, mov- 
ed to take part of the reconver- 
sion program out of the hands 
of the Senate military commit- 
tee, with introduction of a 
“states’ rights” un iployment 
compensation bill ich he pre- 
dicted his committee will approve 
today. 

2. A military subconunittee put 
its approval on a composite gen- 
eral reconversion bill providing 
up to $35 a week unemployment 
pay for the millions now in war 
production, with standards set 
by the federal government. 

The subcommittee measure, de- 
scribed by Chairman Murray 
(P-Mont.) as a composite of a 
bill he introduced with George, 



and another by Senator Kilgore 
(D-W.Va.), proposed creation of 
an Office of War Mobilization 
and Adjustment with broad pow- 
ers over the nation’s economy. 

Senator Revercomb (R-W.Va.) 
vigorously dissented from the 
conclusions of the subcommittee 
majority, Murray and Senator 
'Trumaii (D-Mo.). He protested 
especially against unemployment 
or “interim placement benefits” 
ranging from $12 a w'eek for 
those usually earning $150 to 
$300 a year to $35 for those nor- 
mally drawing $2400 or more. 

The George measure would 
leave to the states the fixing of 
rates, guarantee the solvency of 
state unemployment insurance 
funds and provide federal money 
for the compensation of displaced 
war workers in government ar 
senals and shipyards. 

The bill brought out by Mur

Farr, before returning to her 
home in Bristol, Okla. 



The recreation committee of 
the CCCC’s at Chabot Terrace is 
sponsoring another movie Thurs- 
day evening at 8 o’clock in the 
auditorium of the Community 
building, featuring “There Goes 
My Heart,” with Frederick 
March, Virginia Bruce and Patsy 
Kelley. There will be, also, two 
comedy cartoons. 

A charge of 15 cents will be 
made for adults and 5 cents

ray will be taken up by the full 
military committee Thursday. 

The Office of War Mobilization 
and Adjustment, which it pro- 
poses, would direct the demobili-

workers and some 10,000,000 
members of the armed forces 
with aid of a bureau of pro- 
grams and projects and a produc- 
tion-employment board.

EDMONTON, Alta. (UP). — 
The tpugh, combat-wise Russian 
airmen who for the past two 
years have been ferrying Ameri- 
can-built warplanes across the 
wilderness wastes of Alaska and 
Siberia to European battlefronts 
are great admirers of the Bell 
P-39 Airacobra as an antidote to 
Messerschmitt trouble. 

“Cobra — hokay!” they say, 
making the airman’s universal 
“on the beam” sign — thumb and 
forefinger touching. 

And when these veterans of 
Leningrad, Sevastopol and Stalin- 
grad dog-fighting with one an- 
other in the frosty sub arctic sky 
over Fairbanks and Nome, they 
show they know all the grim 
tricks of their trade. American 
fighter pilots, among the most 
highly trained In the world, give 
the Russian combat fliers credit 
for being very, very hot. 

“Went up against one of those 
lads one day for a practice tilt,” 
said an American colonel, “and 
he taught me something I’ll 
never forget. I was chasing him 
in a steep climb when he dropped 
10 degrees of flaps and let me 
boom past him, and the first 
thing I knew he was on my tail, 
and if it had been a real fight 
I would have been a dead pig- 



eon.

SPRINGFIELD, 111. (INS). — 
Governor Thomas E. Dewey 
boarded a train last night for 
his two-day St, Louis conference 
with Republican governors, af- 
ter a vitriolic denunciation of 
what he described as a “sinis- 
ter” effort by Gerald L. K. Smith 
to “smear the Republican candi- 
date for vice-president.” 

The slashing attack upon 
Smith, whose America First 
party nominated the latter for 
President and (5ov. John W. 
Bricker, GOP vice presidential 
nominee, for vice president, high- 
lighted an action-packed day in 
Springfield for (^v. Dewey who 
also: 

1— Told a crowd of 10,000 per- 
sons that the Republican party 
will build “the best peace the 
world has ever seen.” 

2 — Placed a wreath upon the 
tomb of Abraham Lincoln with 
a renewal of “our determination 
to bring complete squality of op- 
portunity of life in America to 
all the Negro people.” 

3 — Conferred with Ulinoil po- 
litical, business, labor and agrri- 
cultural leaders on plans for a 
Republican postwar conversion 
program. 

Gov. Dewey went all out in 
his attack upon Smith for the 
latter’s attempt to pin the tag 
of isolationism upon the Repub- 
lican national ticket.

LONDON (Wednesday (INS) — 
The Turkish cabinet met last 
night presumably to make final 
decisions on the economic and

which has been reported immi- 
nent for several days, as all Turk- 
ish ships in Bulgarian and Ro-

Turkey were suspended. 

Amid mounting signs that a 
rupture between the two nations 
is not far off, despite Germany’s 
warning of "grave consequences" 
t|to follow, the cabinet was conven- 
*ed following a meeting of the par- 
liamentary group of the republi-

Details of the official discussions 
were not made public. 

The Ankara radio ,in announc-

the Turkish grand national as-

Meanwhile, German nationals 
In Turkey were reported leaving 
or preparing to leave the country

WASHINGTON (INS). — Man- 
uel Luis Quezon, first president 
of the Philippines, died yesterday 
at Saranac I„ake, N. Y., and the 
torch of Filipino independence 
which he had carried so long 
passed into the hands of Vice 
President Sergio Osmena, who 
was sworn into the presidentcj’ 
Immediately. 

As soon as word of President 
Quezon’s death from tuberculo- 
sis and heart complications was 
flashed to his Washington office, 
arrangements were made to ad- 
minister the oath of office to 
his successor, who was in the 
capital at the time. 

Osmena took the oath in the 
office of Secretary of the Inte- 
rior Harold L. Ickes at 2:40 p. m. 
yesterday and assumed the pres- 
idency. United States Supreme 
Court Justice Robert H. Jackson 
administered the oath, the pro- 
cedure varying little from that 
followed when a President of the 
United States dies in office. 

Witnessed by about 100 Fili- 
pino add American officials, the 
ceremony took place after an 
emergency conference of the new 
president with members of the 
Filipino cabinet, who have made 
their headquarters in Washing- 
ton since the island government 
escaped from the Japanese at 
Bataan.

SPEAKER AT THE LIONS CLUB meeting last night at the Ca^a de Vallejo was Horatio

Lions Hear Talk On Wine 



Industry's Role In War 



The part of California's wlne<5> 
industry is taking toward prose- 
cution of the war etfort was told 
to members of the Vallejo Lions 
Club last night in the Casa de 
Vallejo by Horatio F. Stoll, repre- 
senting the California Wine In- 
stitute. In addition to adding to 
the government’s supply of alco- 
hol, the Industry is further aiding 
the war by tartaric acid and 
other by-products of war. 

The present shortage of wine, 
he said, is expected to gnrow 
worse because of the demands on 
the industry'. With wine Imports 
halted by the war, California 
wines are in the front in demand 
throughout the nation. 

One of the changes brought 
about by the war as far as the 
California wine industry is con- 
cerned is the producing of ver- 
mouth, which is the equal to the 
varieties formerly obtained from 
France and Italy. 

Guests at last night’s dinner 
meeting were James D. Richard- 
son of the Vallejo Housing Au- 
thority and Hugh Pomeroy, exec- 
utive director of the National 
Housing Association. 

J. A. Reid, president, presided. 



Bulk Of Housing

Expected Friday 



New Guinea 



Successes 



ADVANCED ALLIED HEAD- 
QUARTERS, New Guinea, (Wed- 
nesday) — (AP) — Americans who 
leaped 200 miles toward Philip- 
pines to land at Sansapor Sun- 
day hopped 10 mllevS farther west 
Jlonday and seized a Japanese 
barge base. 

Twin invasion forces landed be- 
fore dawn Monday on each side 
of the barge base, only 50 miles 
northeast of Sorong, main Japa- 
nese base left on New Guinea. 

Associated Press Correspond- 
ents Fred Uompson and Spencer 
Davis rei>orted that the Ameri- 
cans hoped to trap a consider- 
able Japanese force at the barge 
hideout, but found that the 
eneniy had hasily retreated, leav- 
ing weapons and food supplies. 

There was no resistance here 
or elsewhere along this Dutch 
New Guinea sector only about 
600 miles from Mindanao. The 
.Americans quickly linked their 
new ^ position with the original 
beachhead to provide full control 
of 10 miles of coastline 



Only a few tenants of govern- 
ment dwellings in the Greater 
Vallejo Area refused to pay rent 
increases which went into effect 
yesterday, Harry* Buss, acting 
executive director of the Vallejo 
Housing Authority, announced 
last night 

Additional refusals, however, 
are expected between now and 
August 10, when rents for this 
month become delinquent, he 
intimated. 

The bulk, in all probability, 
will be Friday after this week's 
pay day at Mare Island Navy 
yard. 

The Housing Authority has 
issued orders to offices in 
Chabot Terrace, Federal Terrace 
and Carquinez Heights, where 
3600 families are affected by the 
new rent Increases, not to accept 
rent payments on the former 
rates. 

Langdon Post, FPHA regional 
director, and Maurice Wilsie, 
executive director here, will dis- 
cuss the local situation with Val- 
lejo Housing Authority officials 
and staff members at a confer- 
ence in San FYancisco today when 
a plan of future action \vill be 
outlined:

Sonny Matsme announces that his Carquinez team of boxers 
will havo a return go with Federal Terrace fisticuffers Friday 
night, August 18, at the Hillside auditorium. 

Monday evening the squads mot at the Federal Ring in one 
of the best set of kid matches ever seen in these parts. 

The match between Merle Lauterbach of Federal and Glenn 
Albright of Carquinez was worth going miles to see. The two 
lads stood toe to too throughout the entire three rounds. Both 
boys were in tip top condition, otherwise something might have 
happened. These tw'o should pack them in when they meet two 
weeks hence. 

The next best match was between Manuel Vega of Federal 
and Wallace Loe of Carquinez. Loe had the best of the first two 
rounds with his rushing style. It looked like curtains for Vega 
until he opened up at the close of the second round. In the third 
he had Loe in a bad way. Vega won a close decision in this one. 

Another good encounter was the three-round go between Ken 
Odian, 110 pounds, of Federal and Bill King of Carquinez. Odion 
was awarded the decision. 

•Ilmmy Yoder of Carquinez outpointed Billy Crumb In a hard 
fought tussle. Yotler showecl some of “Sonny Boy’s” training In 
the clinches. i 

Lefty Goroski showed a lot of class in his one-roupd decision 
over Lee Hunt of Carquinez. Hunt was substituting for a fellow 
boxer, at the same time he was outweighed considerably. 

The 70-pound fleawelght fighters, Bobby Tufoya and Don 
Girky, both of Federal, put on a splendid curtain-raiser. 

John Martin and George Vice put on a pleasing three-round 

draw. 

Clark Baker and Clement Araw of Carquinez went for three 
bang-up rounds with Araw getting the decision. 

Richard Pacheco of Carquinez started fast but his opponent, 

Jim Luce, closed the gap to get a well deserved draw. 

Red-headed Bob Grate put up a whale of a fight against his 

taller opponent to gain a draw. 

Bob Dalby won a close decision over Tom Dalby of Federal in 

three fast rounds. 

GOOD ADVICE 

Here’s our promised few pointers to young boxers on grit 
backbone—or in Webster’s English, courage— most beginners in 
boxing are timid. After all, few of us enjoy the anticipation of 
being lambasted just for fun. In no time at all, howeve^^ it 
becomes apparent that very few blows carry any real Wck, and 
that even those are either disregarded or quickly forg 9 tten in the 
excitement of a bout. Carpentier landed \ terrific nght-h^de^ 
Dempsey’s jaw, shaking him up pretty badly. When the fight 
was over, Dempsey denied receiving this blow’, and psychologi^ 
will tell you that he probably never felt it. Thus the m^ who

CLEVELAND, Ohio (INS)— 











is “game” at heart needs only a little experience to pin the con 
fldeLe necessary to overcome timidity. Of cou^. the inherent^ 
pugnacious type finds his heart’s content within the boundanes 

of the ring. ^ . . 

Real honest-to-goodness cowardice is rare. Most men start 

life with plenty of “guts.” Environmental influences are the big 

factors that make or break a man. 

Professor Griffith says: ‘Tfellowness is rarely Inherited. A 
few men are cowards by nature, but most men grow’ cow’ardly 
or unaggresslve because their youth has furnished no opportunity 
for them to learn aggressiveness. They become a part of a gang, 
their parentn b^t Initiative out of them; and In early manhood 
they find that their habits of passively accepting objects and 
events are fixed. They have learned that It Is easier to dodge^ 
difficult objects and events than to meet them.” 

1 Bluntly, what Professor Griffith means is that if a boy is cow- 
* ardly and unaggrressive he has his parents to thank for it. If In 
the course of years of unfavorable training you have acquired an 
inferiority complex, you’ll have to grit your teeth and fight that 
little “yellow streak.” Finding that you are just as good or per- 
haps better than your opponent, you are apt to gain the confidence 
necessary to crush fear and misgivings. Many a man taking 
account of his weakness in this respect has taken up boxing and 
ff gone at it viciously In order to overcome his fear. 

I Boxing, because It Is a man-to-man combat, appears to the 
I spectator as the mo.st dangerous, but there are probably more 
Injuries in one brotherly footbaU game than in 15 of the fiercest 
of prizefights. Even in the days of bare-knuckle fighting the In- 
juries w’ere rar^y of a permanent nature. 

There is no avoiding of occasional injuries of varying severity 
in athletic contests. Every spott takes its toll, chiefly because 
here and there a poorly trained man takes a chance. A well-trained, 
well-conditioned man is in little danger even under prizefight con- .... . 

ditions. 'There are wild &d woolly bruisers whose Idea of boxing inning, 
is that one must absorb all the punishment possible in order to Hughson’s fifth 

get in an occasional blow at your opponent. A skillful boxer is of the season and gave the 

the recipient of very few blows, and even these are of the glancing an even break in the four- 

type. Benny Leonard’s gloss pompadour was rarely mussed even ganie series, 
in a championship battle. | The winning pitcher was Ray

3-LEGGED RACE FOOTBALL 



The California Eagles, greatcKt 
colored baseball club In northern 
California and probably one of 
the greatest in the country, will 
provide tonight’s opposition for 
the 3faro Lslund Sea Horses. 

The sepia sluggers, with four 
former Kansas City Monarchs in 
the lineup, have whipped the best 
of them this spring, including S. 

P. Stores, San Leandro Merch- 
ants, Bay Meadows and Owl 
Drug. They played the Vallejo 
Builders twice last season and 
captured both contests. One of 
the few blots, if it can be called 
that, on their record this season 
Is a 5 to 4 defeat by Sherry 
Liquors. 

Joe Hctten pitched that game 
for Sherrys and it is certainly 
no disgrace to lose to either Hat- 
ton or Sherrys as the Sea Horses 
can no doubt testify. 

Among the stars taking the 
field tonight will be “Snake” 

Temple, Homer Holloway and 
Claude Braude, all ex-Kansas 
City Monarchs; Rudolph Grant, 
also a former Monarch and All- 
Conference at Ohio State a few 
seasons back and John Allen, the 
little All-American from San Jose 
State university. Perhaps better 
known to Vallejo fans is Mel 
Reid, the sensational University 
of San Francisco baseball and 
football player. 

Manager Bunny Simmons was I p ‘ ^ a riVf

either “Gunner” Moore’s or

but the caliber of the opposition 
may cause him to switch to his 
ace, Bill CaiT.

Vallejo Times-Herald, Wednesday, Aug. 2, 1944 — PAGE I I 

Rowdy Cy Williams buttered 
his way buck from what Hecmed 
sure disaster to take two quick 
and brulsbig falls from ‘Mack the 
Giant Killer” Smith at Hillside 
Arena last night and win the 
questionable privilege of being 
fed to the notorious “French An- 
gel” in th& miiin event of next 
week’s show. 

The ex-alligator grappler show- 
ed at his nastiest as he out-slam- 
med Smith to score with a body 
press in four minutes and a jaw- 
lock seven minutes later after 
the Boston boy had downed him 
with a pair of spectacular flying 
tackles off the ropes in the first 
16 minutes. 

TROUBLE FOR REFEREE 

Smith never got a chance to 
use his famous toehold as Wil- 
liams turned the match into an 
anything-goes brawl which had 
Referee Jack Topin screaming 
for attention and getting mauled 
for his trouble. It was one of -the 
roughest matches yet seen at 
Hillside with the audience adding 
plenty to the hysteria. 

Smith was no disappointment 
and would have been the winner 
had Topin responded to repeated 
demands of the crowd that Wil- 
liams be tossed out for obvious ^ 
fouling. The easterner, making 
his forst coast appearance here, 
is a cinch for a return on the fan 
verdict. 

• 

Announcement that the “An- 
gel” would me Williams’ oppon- 
ent next 'Tuesday brought a 
cheer of approval at prospects of 
seeing him tossed to the slaugh- 
ter. For all his roughhouse ef- 
fectiveness as a rassler, the “Tal- 
lahasee Terror” definitely put FIRST DFER BAGGED by a Vallejoan after the season 
hipisels on the books as the most [ opened Monday midnight was this 90-pound forked horn, 
un^pidar i^rfo^er yet to show brought dow’n by the first shot fired by 15-year-old Joe 

Fashauer Jr., shown with his kill above. The young hunts- 
man, whose father operates a body and fender works at 514 
Santa Clara street, got his deer just over the Solano line in 
Yolo county. (Photo by Times-Herald).

Cooper Bounces Bach To Win 
After Trouncing By Bodgers 

NEW YORK (UP).— Proving that lightning doesn’t strike twice 
in the same place, at least on successive days, Mort Cooper yes- 
terday pitched the St Louis Cardinals to a 14-3 triumph over the 
Brooklyn Dodgers. 

The aforementioned ligntning was provided by Brooklyn Mon- 
day night when they knocked Cooper, one of the National League’s 
leading pitchers for the past three years, from the box in less 
than four Innings and went on to beat the league leaders, 6-1. 

Manager Billy Southw’orth started the big right-hander again 
yesterday, a rare occurrence in baseball, and he went the route. 
Cooper allowed the Dodgers 10 hits but was ably supported by 
a 17-hit attack off five Brooklyn pitchers and had little trouble 
winning the decision. Whit Wyatt was the loser.

MANY COUNTY 
DEER BAGGED 

Deor hunters, thinned in num- 
bers by wartime restrictions 
opened the 1944 season in 18 cen- 
tral coastal counties including So- 
lano yesterday following a two- 
year virtual shutdown. 

Hunters from Fairfield, Suisun, 
Vacaville and Dixon were out In 
large numbers in the mountains 
adjacent to Vacaville and Fair- 
field and all report splendid luck, 
most of them coming home with 
a buck. Deer herds are rei>orted 
to have increased greatly due to 
the two-year closed season but 
lack of ammunition and transpor- 
tation difficulties somewhat re- 
duced the take. 

Among the hunters from Fair- 
field getting a buck were George 
(Bud) Peters, highway patrol- 
man, Dwight Woodard, Donald 
Duren, Fairfield police officer, 
and James E. Eaton.

gram. 

Lt. C^l. C. V. Whitney’s three- 
year-old was running second to 
the improving Bellweather up to 
the stretch, w’hen Ariel Game 
took command. But a final drive 
brought Hoodoo three-quarters 
of a length ahead of Ariel Game 
at the finish, after stepping a 
mile in 1:37 2 '5. His backers 
walked off with $7.60, S3.00 and 
$2.30 across the board for his

‘The Richmond Cardinals are

However, this year tho Vallejo

With the fans already asking 
for a return game with Sherr>'s, 
Lloyd Johnson, booking agent, 
has already made arrangements 
to bring back Sherry Liquors, at 
their own request, on Sunday. 
August 27. Sherrys admitted 
that the Builders have tw’o of 
the best pitchers they havo

Business Wises Up 



At very long last an intelligent, 
planned attempt is under way to help 
business make friends with its . home 
town people — its own employes, its local 
businessmen and city fathers and all 
those others upon whom the future of 
the American capitalistic system may 
depend. 

For a while the men of big business 
were honestly puzzled by the hearty 
hatred that threatened to engulf them, 
by it. They knew that the whole econ- 
omy of the country was based upon 
employment. If employers were ruined, 
emplojnnent would disappear and there 
would be no economy. Couldn’t the pub- 
lic understand anything as simple as 
that? 

It was several yeai's before some 
business began to realize that the public 
did notnmderstand. One major reason 
for the public’s failure was the high and 
mighty attitude that business as a 
whole had been taking — its failure to 
let the man in the street know, by 
specific illustration, what business con- 
tributes to the American way of life. 

From the time that this realization 
' permeated businessmens minds, there 
was a campaign, still expanding, to sell 
to the public the fundamental import- 
ance of business to the prosperity and 
happiness of labor. A fair job has been 
done. Progress is being made. 

That campaign, however, has been 
mostly on the broad, over-all national 
scale. Some of the keener minds have 
awakened to the fact that this is not 
enough. A worker can be fully per- 
suaded that his own prosperity depends, 
generally, upon an economy of free en- 
terprise, and yet can be completely 
blind to the contribution being made by 
the very company on whose payroll he 
is employed. 

One of the country’s biggest public 
relations firms has co-operated in pre- 
paring a series of advertisements for 
use bv businesses in their home town 
papers. One of the men who helped to 
prepare the advertisements tells a per- 
sonal experience that helped formulate 
the approach : 

‘T grew up in a Pennsylvania city 
that had three or four really large in- 
dustrial employers. Yet even today I 
do not know what any one of them con- 
tributed to that city and to my family 
and me. 

‘T realize that they must have been 
important. They hired a lot of men, 
who supported families on their wages. 
Those families paid rent, patronized 
grocers, clothiers, furniture stores, pic- 
ture houses, trolley companies and bus 
lines, drugstores, cobblers’ shops, auto- 
mobile salesrooms, garages and filling 
stations, tailors and barbers and beauty 
pai'lors. The employes of those in- 
dustries. and the owners and workers 
in the stores and service industries, all 
" bought insurance, put savings into the 
banks, used checlang accounts, etc. 

'‘Almost everything spread out 
from those four shops, but I didn’t know 
it then. They never troubled to tell us. 
I might not realize it now, except that a 
railroad that had shops there asked 
the City Council for some tax relief. 
The Council, which didn’t know any 
more than I did about what the shops 
meant to the town, refused. The shops 
were moved. They took with them 
a lot of families and left other wage- 
earners jobless. 

‘Tt’s my guess that if that rail- 
road had told the townspeople some 
cold facts about what it was doing 
for our city, some way would have 



been found to keep the shops there.’* 

Pi'eparation of these advertise- 
ments, designed to be localized by em- 
ployers, probably is the fii*st organ- 
ized by employers, probably is the first 
organized attempt to help industries 
sell themselves in their home towns. 
It grew out of a round-table spons- 
ored last January by Editor & Pub- 
lisher, the newspaper trade journal. 

The step is significant because it 
marks the first active recognition on 
behalf of business generally that no 
business in these times can remain 
bigger or more prosperous or safer 
than its place in the affections of the 
pity in which it is located. 



The Thirty Years' War 

Thirty years ago, on Aug. 4, 1914, 
the German army entered Belgium 
and began the war which continues 
today. The restless, troubled years 
between 1918 and 1939 were not peace, 
but a deceptive lull in which some pre- 
pared to renew the fight while others 
looked on in an almost fatal lethargy. 

Thirty years ago there began 
what most of the world thought was 
another of Europe’s wars in which a 
convenient ‘‘incident” seiwed as ex- 
cuse for trying to settle some more 
of Europe’s interminable diplomatic 
squabbles. But a power-hungiy Ger- 
many bent on world conquest knew it 
was to be a people's war, a bloody, 
devastating, total war fought with new 
and deadly instruments of science and 
ideas. 

The first conflict taught America 
that science had shrunk the world until 
no country could be sure that it might 
live undisturbed in peace and freedom 
while a force that opposed peace and 
freedom sought to impose its will else- 
where on the globe. We learned the 
lesson slowly. Some thought at the 
armistice, that war was gone forever. 
Others believed that if war returned to 
Europe, it need not concern us. 

That clash of American opinion pre- 
vented our joining the League of Na- 
tions. Doubtless we should have done 
so, and lent our power and prestige and 
idealism to the preseiwation of peace. 
Yet it is not indisputable that we would 
have succeeded. We can see now that 
the League, in principle, stopped just 
short of the strong measures needed to 
put down incipient war, and, in prac- 
tice, stopped considerably shorter. 

There was a good deal of cynicism 
as well as idealism in the League. There 
were too many statesmen who wanted 
to play power politics the same old way. 
There" were too many behind-the-hand 
agreements and understandings. Old 
habits and prejudices were too strong 
when the showdowns came in Man- 
churia, Ethiopia, Spain and Germany. 
It is not at all certain that our presence 
could have altered the course of events. 

The second outbreak has taught us 
no new lessons. The world knew in the 
21 yeai-s of armistice that the resump- 
tion of war would be even more bloody 
and devastating. The world knew what 
countries would have to be put down, 
and why. America knew, even as she 
tried to persuade herself otherwise, 
that the world had shrunk still smaller 
and that escape v/as impossible. 

The modern Thirty Years’ War is 
drawing to a close. This time the pros- 
pects for peace are more promising. 
Today, at least, we know that if the 
job is not done right this time, more 
war will come, and bring with it not 
only the end of progi-ess, but the end of 
civilization as we know it. That is the 
sober, literal, frightful truth. 




Pointers on Political Parade 



SACRAMENTO. — Californians, who are 
showTi by statistics emanating from many 
sources to have “plenty” of money to spend, are 
finding that purveyors of civilian goods are bet- 
ter able to supply their wants than was expected 
by anyone a year ago. 

This is pointed out by James S. Dean, state 
director of finance. In his report of receipts and 
expenditures by the state government during the 
fiscal year which ended June 30, Dean said, “Thus 
far, scarcities in civilian supplies have had vir- 
tually no net effect upon sales tax collections.” 

Receipts from this source during the year 
w’ere only *2 of 1 per cent less than the 1942-43 
collections, despite the fact that the sales tax 
rate starting Oct. 1, 1943, was 2^ per cent in- 
stead of the former 3 per cent. 

The state tax on personal incomes produced 
$43,316,000. nine millions up from the previous 
year although the aggregate rate was cut 43 per 
cent by the legislature when it reduced the sales 

tax rate. 

Arjii al receipts by the state from all sources 
during tfie 1943-44 fiscal year exceeded budget 

bv S92.343.000. of which half repre- 



fifth each from franchise and personal income 
taxes and the remaining 10 per cent from other 
levies. 

General fund expenditures amounted to $206,- 
609,000, which was $16,708,000 less than antici- 
pated on the basis of authorized appropriations 
and estimated fixed requirements. 

As a result, the state on June 30 had a gen- 
eral fund surplus of $154,028,000, instead of the 
$58,344,000 that was expected a year ago. In 
addition, there is a reserve of $25,000,000 against 
possible war catastrophes, $14,588,000 to meet 
debt obligations maturing between July 1, 1945, 
and June 30, 1949, and $33,000,000 in the post- 
war construction fund. 

The legislature earmarked $75,000,000 of the 
$154,028,000 surplus for transfer into the post- 
war construction or employment fund and $30,- 
000,000 into the teachers' retirement fund . 

A total of 19,424 veterans of the First World 
War have purchased farms and homes costing 
$80,459,023 under the state veteians farm and 
home purchase act, the state military and vet- 
erans affairs department disclosed today.

NATIONAL WHIRLIGIG 



NEWS BEHIND THE NEWS— By RAY TUCKER 



Replacement of General Hideki 
Tojo by General Kuniaki Kolso 
as Prime Minister of Japan does 
not signify a crack in the Nip- 
ponese home front, say oriental 
experts. It might easily mean a 
strengthening of the imperial 
war effort. 

Prime ministers in Japan never 
stay long in office. Real power 
is exercised by an inner jimta 
comi>osed of aristocrats and 
army and navy leaders, in con- 
junction with a few influential 
civilian capitalists and politi- 
cians. A representative of each 
of these groups heads the cab- 
inet in rotation. This is not pro- 
vided by the constitution but is 
a kind of unwritten rule. It gives 
an out>^"ard appearance of team- 
work among the Japanese elite. 

There is no time limit to the 
office of premiership, but the av- 
erage term is less than a year. 
When the inner circle decides 
that a change is desirable the 
prime minister presents his hum- 
ble resignation to Emperor Hiro- 
hito. This became a firm rule 
In 1932, after hotheaded young 
military officers had assassinat- 
ed in turn Messrs. Hamaguchi 
and Inukai, two civilian politi- 
cians who had. risen to the high- 
est office. 

Although our State Depart- 
ment likes to boast of its aware- 
ness of the explosive situation 
In the Far East during the ten 
years before Pearl Harbor, the 
fact is that little public attention 
was focused 01 ^ the sinister 
change that occurred in Japanese 
political affairs in the critical 
year 1932. The slaying of Pre- 
mier Inukai confirmed beyond 
dispute the supremacy of the 
army and navy behind the scenes 
in the Japanese government, not- 
withstan^ng the long program 
of toleration subsequently pur- 
sued by the United States. 

Since the death of Ki Inukai 
in May, 1932, Japan has had 11 
premiers, including General Koi- 
so. The record speaks for itself. 
Here it is: 

Four of the premiers were gen- 
erals. 

Three were admirals. 

Three were aristocrats. 

One, Koki Hirota, was a pro- 
fessional politician. 

General Tojo's performance in 
holding his post for three years 
and nine months amounts almost 
to the Japanese equivalent of a 
fourth term, compared with the 



brief tenure of his predecessors, i as the Imperial Rule Assistance

The name of its leader, Mitsuru 
Toyama, is held in almost equal 
awe to that of Emperor Hirohito. 
From its ranks come the assas-

NOTHING INSIGNIFICANT IN LIFE 

It Is amazing the extent to which little things can cause 
ble in the w’orld. Doctors tell us that the clot which causes a * 
or a coronary occulsion is not large. Sometimes It is no larf« 
the head of a pin, or even the point of a pin. 

A little speck of dirt will sometimes clog the tubing in 
diesel engines and bring them to a stop. The little speck oI 
tion at the root of a tooth may tie a person up with artliril 
piece of steel so small that one can scarcely see it can blii 
eye and sometimes produce death. Fatal disease germs a 
small that they can be .seen only through a microscope, and 

of the most deadly agents of destruction defy detection €4 
this means. 

We pay a great deal of attention to the big things of 
all too little attention to things which at first glance app* 
significant. But there is nothing insignificant in the worid 
in a w'hile newspapers are filled with accounts of tomaW 
tidal w*aves. But most of the accidents in life take plao6 
home. More people are killed by falling down stairs and 

off step ladders than are killed by volcanic eruptions and 
storms. 

The little things in life have a tremendous significant

Vicente Villamin, noted Filipino 
Economist Is undoubtedly the 
only Filipino In the United Sta- 
tes today that can best qualify 
to discuss the economic problems 
of the PlUllppIncs. He spent over 



qualified to discuss the economics 
of the Philippines than Mr. Villa- 
min, who for over 20 years has | 
grappled with economic problems 
and came in contact with econom- 
ic leaders all over the world. 

The present situation in Philip- 
pine affairs offers him a splendid 
opportunity to put his ideas into 
practice. Besides his intrinsic qual- 
ifications, Mr. Villamin has an in- 
vincible enthusiasm and is not af- 
flicted with petty jealousies and 
tyrannies. He Is as human, demo- 
cratic and just as a person of flesh 
and blood could be. 

For Political Independence 

Mr. Villamin is for Philippine in- 
dependence. He has so declared 
iiimsclf repeatedly. Being a man 
of sincerity and consistency, he is 
not satisfied with saying that he 
is for independence; but he is in- 
terested in drafting economic plans 
that will make the Philippines 
really independent. 

His interest centers on the com- 
mon man, the nttle man, the man 
that makes up the masses, the man 
that does the working, the build-

construction. 

One thing, w'e must confess, is 
the source of a great regret. We 
wish that our Constitution handn’t 
been tampered with by the Cong- 
ress of the United States. But we 
are drawing a veil of oblivion over 
that interlude in our national life, 
considering it as one of the heta- 
combs that a cruel war has forced 
into existence. 

Wo prayerfully hope and trust 
that we will never again have to 
crusade against objectionable per- 
sons and policies in our govern- 
ment; but, placing the best in- 
terests of the people over and 
above men and administrations, we 
shall not hesitate to draw the 
sword from the scabbard and do 

battle for the people. 

Our friend, the author of the 
letter which we mentioned above, 
adverts to the credit that doesn't 
always go to the crusader for his 
success. That is true in crusades as 
in many other human efforts and 
activities. It only proves the frail- 
ties and fickleness of the human 
mind. But while we deplore it we 
are not permitting ourself to be 
disappointed. And we are not dis- 
appointed. Why should we be ? 
Our crusades have borne fruit; 
the fruit of progress, of better- 
ment and of greatness. And we are 
the better for it. Our people are 
the better for it. And the govern- 
ment is the better for it. That s 
what counts most. 

After the battles have been 
fought and won, we have intended 
to go on a sort of sabbatical leave 
from the arduous duties of Ex- 
ecutive Editor of this paper. It is 
still our intention to do so, but 
our plans are subject to certain 
contingencies. If, for instance, the 
Filipino Fascists who have left the 
jgovemment arc to wreak ven- 
geance on those who opposed them, 
we will stay at the firing line and 
give them battle and belligerency 

with all our might. 

We have fought not only for the 
rights but also for the dignity of 
the Filipinos of the rank and file. 
Wc have fought for the principles 
for which the present war is being 
waged with such enormous cost in 
lives and treasure. And surely we 
will not be found lying supinely 
on our back and permitting the 
Fascists and their followers to 
have it their own way. 

We have sworn before the altar 
of Filipino patriotism; and we will

Death Of ML(J) 
Announced By 
Sergio Osmena 



In Washington, immediately 
after he was advised of the death 
of President Quezon, Hon. Sergio 
Osmena stated: 

“It is with a deep sense of sor- 
row and personal loss that I must 
give the sad news of the passing 
away of President Manuel L. Que- 
zon of the Philippines. He died 
in Saranac Lake, N. Y., at 10:00 
this morning, with Mrs. Quezon 
and his three children at his bed- 
side. 

“President Quezon’s death is a 



Jaime Hernandez 
Sec. Of Finance 



Auditor General Jaime Hernan- 
dez has been appointed by Presi- 
dent Osmena as Secretary of Fi- 
nance, succeeding Col. Andres So- 
riano, resigned. Mr. Hernandez 
will hold the two positions. He is 
also a member of the Philippine 
Rehabilitation Commission. Tlie 
position of Secretary of Finance 
has few and light duties and that 
of Auditor General is about the 
same. 

Mr. Hernandez, like General 
Valdes, may have other Cabinet 
portfolios with nominal duties. 
★ 



Col Carlos Romulo 
Resident Com. 



Upon the resignation of Joaquin 
M. Elizaldc as Resident Commis- 
sioner Col. Carlos P. Romulo was 
appointed by President Osmena as 
his successor. The Colonel was the 



Secretary of the Department of 
great loss to the freedom loving information and Public Relations, 
world. No champion of liberty 



fought for such a noble cause with 
more determination and against 
greater odds. His whole life was 
dedicated to the achievement of 
his people’s freedom, and it is one 
of the sad paradoxes of fate that 
with the forces of victory fast ap- 
proaching the Philippines, he 
should pass away now and be de- 
prived of seeing the culmination of 
his labors — the freedom of his 
people. 

“To the Filipinos, President Que- 
zon’s demise is a severe blow. No

Since his arrival from Bataan 
Commissioner Romulo has w'ritten 
two books and many magazine and 
newspaper articles. He has deliv-

the country. 

It is expected that Congress will 
hear often about the Philippines 

from Col. Romulo.

Editor Gives 
Success Formula 



Major Villomor 
To Washington 



Close obser\'ers of Philippine af- 
fairs believe that Major Jesus Vil- 
lamor, the foremost Philippine ace 
and a real hero, may be called to 
join the Department of National 
Defense. 

When Sebastian Ugarte, who has 
had no experience is made a Major 
and designated as Executive Di- 
rector of the Department and 
when (^1. Alejandro Melchor, who 
has no combat record, is the Un- 
der-Secretary it is only reasonable 
to expect that Major Villamor 
should be given a high responsibil- 
ity in the Osmena government. 

The MAIL proposes him and 
presents his name to the new Pres- 
ident. 



A Filipino editor in Los Angeles 
favors niipinos with his formula 
of success. The formula: "You 
want to be a successful man. One 
of the first requisites is to know 
yourself. Analyze yourself. Be able 
to find your weakness and remedy 
them. Be able to select your strong 
and positive points and make them 
more powerful.’’ In saecula saccol- 
orum, Amen.

reme Court Robert II. Jackson. Osmena Is regardeJ as the greatest 
Filipino Statesman that the Philippines has ever produced. 



A NEW ERA WITH OSMENA 



A few hours after the demise of President Manuel L. 
(Juezon on August 1, 1944, Sergio Osmena took th oath of 
office in Washington as President of the Philippines. 

There is no Vice-President now because the joint reso- 
lution of the U. S. Congress suspending the relevant provi- 
sions in the Philippine Constitution does not provide for 



one, 



As the result of the e.xpose of 
The MAIL, the entire subject of 
per diems paid Philippine govern- 
ment employees will be reviewed 
and standardized and improper and 
excessive allowances eliminated. 
Some officials are getting fabu- 
lously big sums of money in per 
diems. 



In the resultant situation, if the President should be- 
come unable to serve, the Philippine government would be 
acephalous, or without head. The Congress can — and un- 
doubtedly it will — remedy the situation, and it should be 
asked to do so with a perfecting legislation before a possible 
emergency presents itself. It could, for instance, create a 
Governing Committee to be designated conditionally now 
with the advice of the President of the Philippines, or the 
President of the United States could be authorized, as before 
the birth of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935, to ap- 
point the Chief Executive inferim when the contingency 

arises. 

However, President Osmena himself can forestall addi- 
tional Congressional legislation or any untoward polidcal

changed, Filipinos who own homes 
and real property will have plenty 
to worry about after the war. This 
is the opinion of those who have 
studied the situation, examining 
the opinion of Attorney General 
Kenny and knowing the actions 
and plans of title companies and 
banks as well as the opinions of 
members of the California legis- 
lature. 

It is imperative that the matter 
Is straightened out in the coming 
session of the legislature and Fili- 
pino property owners get together 
and do something about it. 

If they leave it to the Philip- 
pine government only and do no- 
thing to protect their rights they 
will have nobody to blame but 
themselves if the time comes that 
the contracts by which they ob- 
tained their property are invali- 
dated and they are subjected to 
criminal prosecution. 



Col. George Clarke, who fought 
in Bataan and is now assigned as 
instructor in a school in Georgia, 
is under consideration for security 
or liaison officer for the Philip- 
pine government, according to in- 
formation from Washington. His 
appointment would be a very popu- 
lar one both among Filipino civil- 
ians and the soldiers who fought 
in the Battle of the Philippines. 

The (Colonel speaks several Fili- 
pino dialects and is a sincere ad- 
mirer and friend of the Filipino 
people. 



Williams And Bain

A. D. Williams, former Philip- 
pine director of public works, and 
Dr. Foster Bain, mining adviser 
to the late President Quezon, have 
rendered the Philippines valuable!

and may be asked to join the Phil- 
ippine Rehabilitation Commission.

that have already come true, as 
follows: 

“Gen. Douglas MacArfhur

Republican Party for President 

of the U.S. 

“Vice-President Sergio Osme- 
na will be the President of the 
Plillippines this year. 

“Jap Prime Minister Tojo will 
not remain In office through 
general dissatisfaction of the 
Jcp people. 

“Commissioner J. M. Ellzalde 
will leave the Philippine gov- 
ernment service, 

"President Franklin D. Roose-

Osmena and Quezon 
In its recent issue, Thin World 
said: 

“Osmena, w’ho is solid where 
Quezon was fluid, con.scrvativc 
where Quezon was unpredictable, 
inteligcnt where Quezon was bril- 
liant. thus inherited an incredibly 
hard job. For Quezon had always 
been a one-man political rnardi 
gras. Osmena fought against the 
great man once (and been de- 
feated), then he had fought with 
him (and been blotted out by the 
Great Man’s shadow').’’ 

Many w'cre the tributes paid to 
the memory of the late Pres. Que- 
zon. They came from both the 
great and the lowly, from friends 
and critics w'ho frankly admitted 
that his death was a stunning 
surprise due to its suddenness. 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
away from Washington, immedi- 
ately released a loving tribute to 
“my old friend. Manuel Quezon,” 
saying; 

Rooscvclt’h Tribute 
“The death of my old friend 
Manuel Quezon of the Philippine 
Commonw'oallh i b profoundly 
shocking, although I knew, a.s did 
his many friends, that only a 
fierce determination had kept him 
alive the past several years.. 

“President Quezon died without 
seeing the cause of the Philippine 
Independence fully realized. Death 
came at a lime when the nation 
he loved and for whose welfare he 
labored many years is in the hands 
of the Japanese Invader. He died, 
howev'er, in full confidence that 
the 18 million Filipinos of his 
homeland will be freed of foreign 
domination and that, with the 
pedged assistance of the United 
States, they w'ill become a self- 
governed people. 

"He will be remembered by his 
people w'ith the respect and ven- 
eration that W'e in the United 
States have for the name of 
George Washington.” 

Gen. .MacArlhur Mourns 
General Douglas MacArthur. 
busy in the Southw'cst Pacific and 
hoping for the day when he would 
take with him his friend back to 
the Philippine;^, also paid a loving 
tribute to Pres. Quezon and ^.aid: 
“I mourn him.” 

How deep was the affection of 
Gen. MacArthur for Pres. Quezon 
is explained by tho.se three w’ord^. 
It would seem sacrilege to elabo- 
rate on them.

RESUME OF THE MAIL’S CRUSADES IN 1943 - 44 



■1 



By Manuel M. Insigne, Executive Editor 



Manuel L. Quezon 

After staying on this green earth for 65 years, Manuel 
Luis Quezon Antonio y Molina, first President of the Phil- 
ippines, took leave for that Place Unknown from where 
nobody returns. His departure occurred one tranquil morn- 
ing on August 1, 1944, at Saranac Lake in New York State 
far away from the modest spot where he first saw the light 
of day. Loving ones were around him to bid him farewell 
and Mother Nature was beautiful and caressing as she made 
him welcome to that borderless, beatific kingdom where 
celestial life goes on forever and ever. 

Manuel L. Quezon was a man among men. He was 
great, dynamic and powerful. He had the ability to make 
himself felt and understood by his fellowmen. He served 
the people according to his lights and they responded to 
him with confidence. To them he was the incarnation of 
their highest hope for the natioif. 

A forthright man, he respeaed — though he fought — 
opposition. He had little use for the unthinking and self- 
serving comfortist. But he valued loyalty and insisted on 
it. To him good faith was the measuring rod of a person’s 
usefulness and patriotism. He respected him who strives, 
builds, thinks, fights for his ideas and helps in promoting 
the colleaive well-being. 

Manuel L. Quezon is gone. He left a void that would 
remain unfilled in the history of the country that he served 
and loved so well.

Filipino Farmer- Forward! 

Sooner or later the Filipino growers and farmers will 
be organized into a real, working body that will be effective 
in promoting their individual and collective welfare. The 
task of organization and unification is not an easy one and 
it takes time ad efforts to get it under way. The first steps 
are being taken and it is hoped that the remaining steps will 
be taken with accelerated speed. 

The war is being won and its end is getting nearer and 
nearer. Filipino farmers should prepare themselves to 
face the new situation when peace comes. During the war 
when American farmers left their work for war duties and 
activities Filipinos found it relatively easy to go into 
farming. 

But when the absent farmers come back, joined by new 
ones from closed war industries, the Filipino farmers may 
be confronted with problems that may bring them woes 
and worries. How to face or avoid these possible prob- 
lems should engage their immediate attention now. And 
that’s one of the strong reasons w'hy they should put their 
heads together, weigh their problems and take cooperadve 



aaion. 



o 



Filipinos and Government 

We have a new President and it is to be expeaed that 
there w'ill be new policies concerning the Filipinos in the 
United States. 

President Sergio Osmena has a good knowledge of 
their conditions, activities and problems. He is more or less 
acquainted with the unsuccessful work that has been done 
among them under G)mmissioner Elizalde. Naturally, he 
will be guided in 'the future by the failures of the past. 
With a good leadership and concrete and simple plans the 
Filipinos in America could be welded into a well-knit force 
that could be helpful to the government and the Filipino 
people while their own best interests are promoted and 
strengthened. 

In the past, two things operated against the progress 
of the work among the Filipinos in this country: (a) The 
lack of a definite plan on the part of the government; and, 
(b) the wrong type of persons appointed to work among 
them, which did not necessarily mean that these persons 
were lacking in virtues and abilities for some other work. 
These two things have created among the rank and file of 
Filipinos a general lack of confidence in government offi- 
cials and a hopeless if not helpless state of mind. 

We expect much of President Osmena. We know he 
wants to do the necessary and the right thing. The Fili- 
pinos want to be useful to their government and they want 
to feel their government is with them.

funds belonging to it on deposit in 
the United States amounted to 
nearly 5220,(XX),000 when it ar- 
rived. 

The MAIL made diligent efforts 
to know its personnel as well as 
its activities. It assumed two defi- 
nite policies in connection with 
that government: 

1 . It upheld and stood by it. 

2. It tried its best to help it 
serve the cause of the war, the 
cause of democracy and the cause 
of the average Filipino. 

It found many things to be done 
that were not being done. It dis- 
covered many practices that 
should not have been practiced. It 
came upon a cesspool of Fascism, 
racialism, favoritism, extrava- 
gance, unrealism, inefficiency and 
general backwardness. It knew 
soon enough that it had a crusade 
to undertake, and so without fear 
and with all fairness it plunged 
into the titanic task of cleansing, 
so to speak, the Aegean stables. 

In presenting its points, to make 
them as arresting and interesting 
as possible. The MAIL knowingly 
employed unusual and unorthodox 
methods of exposition and discus- 
sion compatible with the realities 
and their logical implications. It 
used satire, hyperbole, repetition, 
conversations and other literary 
forms. It adopted both the objec- 
tive and the discursive approach; 
and it used the strategy of fronted 
assault and flank attack. The net 
result of these methods is to ac- 
quire for The MAIL a wide circle 
of readers all over the United 
States. 

Its articles found their way to 
Americem government officials. 
Congressional leaders, editors of 
metropolitan newspapers, leading 
businessmen, educators and civic 
leaders, public libraries and educa- 
tional institutions. They also went 
to Filipino farm and factory work- 
ers, soldiers and sailors, govern- 
ment officials and the Filipino in- 
telligentsia. 

As expected, the Fascists and 
Falangists, comprised of Filipinos 
who became citizens only recently 
but had already wielded powerful 
influence in the Philippine govern- 
ment, tried to suppress The MAIL 
and to discourage its personnel by 
all sorts of undercover means. 
Some Fiipinos, out of unpatriotic 
self-interest or plain ignorance or 
malice, helped them, but all their 
efforts have ony resulted in mak- 
ing The MAIL the real and ac- 
cepted champion of Filipinos and 
Filipinism, of Filipino patriotism 
and nationalism. In other words, 
it emerged stronger, more deter- 
mined, more popular and more 
convinced in the rectitude and nec- 
essity of Its crusades. 

The following are the main ques- 
tions dealt with by The MAIL in 
its intense and forthright cru- 
sade which, it is morally certain, 
the Filipino people will approve 
because they are honestly and 
patriotically conceived, courage- 
ously and vigorously conducted 
and purely and exclusively intend- 
ed to uphold the dignity and rights 
of the individual Filipino, the good 
name and welfare of the Filipino 
nation and its future prosperity 
and stability, the effectiveness and 
democratic nature of the govern- 
ment and its part in the war, the 
Filipinization of the government 



This is a report to the Filipino people, who will not have a 
chance to read it until after the war. But it will be saved for 
them, for they would want to read an account of their govern- 
men in exile from an independent source. 

That government, headed by the late President Manuel L. 

Quezon, with a war Cabinet arrived in Washington, D. C. in 

the middle part of May 1942. The^ — ; — 77 ^ 

pation in the war, especially m the 

reconquest of the Philippines from 
the Japanese invaders, and keep to 
the irreducible minimum speeches, 
statements and press releases in 
order not to emphasize the mere 
verbal nature of the Filipino par- 
ticipation in the war and to pre- 
vent the creation of paper patriots, 
literary leaders and oratorical he- 
roes at a time when physical force 
was, as it still is, the chief arbit- 
rament in the contest of war and 
the struggle for survival. 

Credit to Fighters 

3. The MAIL with the greatest 
pleasure and honor has proposed 
that the Philippine government in 
exile treat the Filipino sdldiers 
who have fallen prisoners of the 
Japanese in the same way as the 
American government is treating 
her own, by promoting, citing and 
decorating the deserving, in their 
absence, and stop heaping honors 
on non-combatant escapees from 
Bataan and Corregidor so in that 
manner the credit is given to 
whom it is primarily due. 

It also proposed that the Chief 
of Staff of the Philippine Army 
should go to the fighting front 
with General Douglas MacArthur. 

The MAIL stands squarely on 
the proposition that the Filipinos 
who fought the enemy are entitled 
to everything that a grateful na- 
tion could give them and that their 
feunilies be given help, sympathy 
and real consideration. 

In the United States rich Fili- 
pino refugees, who should work 
but do not, are being pampered by 
the government by lending them 
money with which to live, in some 
cases, in gn^at luxury. In some 
cases too. it is known that families 
of Filipino fighters who have been 
captured by the Japanese are not 
getting even the ordinary atten- 
tion that is due them and, on the 
contrary, are given discourage- 
ment and shabby treatment, which 
is a nameless crime of the first 
magnitude. 

Soxiano-Ellzalde 

4. The MAIL pointed out with 
an unerring and unvacillating de- 
cisiveness that the Philippine gov- 
ernment in exile was loaded down 
with officials, mostly recently 
naturalized Filipinos of Spanish 
origin, whose background, ideas 
and methods were anti-democratic, 
anti-Filipino and Fascistic. Andres 
Soriano and Joaquin M. Elizalde, 
both members of the War Cabinet, 
the first being the Secretary of 
Finance and the second the Resi- 
dent Commissioner, were principal 
figures in this group that had cre- 
ated much ill-will and misunder- 
standing inside the government 
and much suspicion and criticism 
outside on the part of Americans 
who want to see a real Filipino 
government conducted by Filipi- 
nos, native born or naturalized, 
and indoctrinated with democratic 
ideas and ideals. 

This phase of our crusade was 
the subject of much misrepresen- 
tation on the part of the Filipino 
Fascists and their misguided 
stooges, but the overwhelming ma- 
jority of Filipinos and Americans 
who have noticed our crusade were 
not misled by them. The crusade 
produced an improvement, al- 
though not yet complete. 

The Yacht “LIMBAS” 

5. The MAIL questioned serious- 
ly and in good faith the authority. 



personnel and the insistence on propriety and conditions of the 



democratic principles as the work- 
ing basis of the Philippine govern- 
ment. 

The Constitution 

1. The MAIL fought to keep the 
Philippine Constitution from being 
suspended, tampered with and 
made light of, and incidentally sup- 
ported Vice-President Sergio Os- 
mena for President as provided for 
in the Constitution. 

However, Congress was influ- 
enced to suspend the Constitution 
partially and Mr. Quezon was per- 
mitted by resolution of that body 
to continue as President and Mr. 
Osmena as Vice-President for the 
duration of the war. The MAIL 
stood for the integrity and the 
sanctity of the Philippine funda- 
mental law, but expediency pre- 
vailed over principle. 

The War Effort 

2. The MAIL repeatedly and in- 
sistently proposed that the Philip- 
pine government organize the Fili- 
pinos in the United States for a 
greater and more vigorous partici- 



purchase by the Philippine govern- 
ment of the second-hand, 75-foot 
yacht “Limbas" from Commission- 
er Joaquin M. Elizalde. The Phil- 
ippine government disbursed a to- 
tal of about $130,000 for purchase 
price and remodeling of the vessel. 
There was no authority in law for 
the purchase. The transaction was 
between two officials of the gov- 
ernment, a practice that is taboo 
in all well-ordered governments. 

The Philippine government could 
have procured a more suitable ves- 
sel for the price than the “Lim- 
bas.” 

The precedent established in the 
purchase of this vessel was cer- 
tainly to be deplored and a sense 
of delicacy should have prevented 
the transaction after its legal con- 
sideration had been disregarded. 
It is still in order to make a thor- 
ough inquiry of this case; and if 
war considerations argue against 
the inquiry, it should be done after 
the war. 

6 . At a time when the principles 



of decency, equality and democ- 
racy are being defended in the 
battlefields some Spanish-Filipino 
officials in the Philippine govern- 
ment, notoriously Commissioner 
Joaquin M. Elizalde. have intro- 
duced racial discrimination against 
dark-skinned Filipinos and prefer- 
ence in employment for Mestizos 
and foreigners; discouraged Fili- 
pinos from obtaining important 
jobs in the American government; 
opposed even deserving Filipinos 
from occupying positions of re- 
sponsibility in the American armed 
forces; terrorized Filipinos for us- 
ing their right of free speech and, 
to their eternal damnation, felt 
powerful and mean enough to be- 
rate, despise and look down upon 
the Vice-President, Mr. Sergio 
Osmena. 

The MAIL used its big and small 
guns unceasingly against these 
forces of reaction. Fascism and 
anti-Filipinism and never permit- 
ted itself to be intimidated by any 
manner or means. An improve- 
ment in the situation has been 
effected, but the complete elimina- 
tion of the evils is still to be done. 

Falangism-Fascism 

7. A book on Spanish Falangist 
acti\ities mentions Secretary of 
Finance Andres Soriano in a man- 
ner that shows his identification 
with Fascism and alleged anti- 
American activities; and American 
newspapers and a Member of Con- 
gress adverted to that fact. 

As Mr. Soriano is a high and 
powerful official of the Philippine 
government who became a Fili- 
pino citizen only a few days after 
Pearl Harbor, The MAIL very 
properly kept asking him to ex- 
press himself and let the Filipinos 
know where he stands at the pres- 
ent on the principles of govern- 
ment, and kept insisting on it be- 
cause of the impressive fact that 
we are fighting this war precisely 
to down the principles of Fascism 
and Falangism. 

Mr. Soriano has refused tb break 
his silence, thus disappointing his 
Filipino countrymen, embarrass- 
ing the Philippine government and 
worrying the Ameican govern- 
ment. Mr. Soriano should be rea- 
sonable and adopt some democrat- 
ic principles and express himself 
on his political and social beliefs 
to prove that he is not a Fascist. 

Filipinos in U. S. 

8 . The MAIL took up in earnest 
the indifference of the Philippine 
government towards the Filipinos 
in America and their problems and 
exposed the empty, inefficacious 
but expensive and pompous ges- 
tures of being interested through 
the sending at periodic intervals of 
officials who lack knowledge, en- 
thusiasm, qualifications and sus- 
tained interest in fighting for the 
rights of Filipinos in the United 
States and promoting their wel- 
fare in both social and economic 
fields. Some of these officials even 
attempted to divide Filipinos 
against each other, made many un- 
authorized promises of jobs, misled 
Filipino farmers about the govern- 
ment’s readiness to assist them 
financially, started whispering 
campaigns against Filipinos who 
don’t kowtow to them, and gener- 
ally created a state of ill-will, sus- 
p i c i o n and misunderstanding 
among Filipinos in the United 
States. 

These Filipinos operated under 
orders of Commissioner Elizalde 
and are guilty of campaigning 
against Vice-President Osmena 
when he was to become the Presi- 
dent under the Constitution which 
they intended to throw to the 
scrap heap. These Filipino bureau- 
crats and mischief-makers have 
been stopped and brought down to 
earth. 

Favoritism 

9. The MAIL strongly believes 
that the Philippine government 
should secure the services of the 
best Filipino talents for govern- 
ment work, stop favoritism and 
concentration of power among po- 
litical and social friends and in- 
augurate a new deal of broad- 
mindedness, enlightened coopera- 
tion and recognition of merit. The 
time is long overdue to have men 
of ability, character and experi- 
ence in the government service. 
The incompetent, the idle, the su- 
perfluous and the unpatriotic 
should be dismissed. Strong men, 
informed men, hard-working men 
are absolutely needed after the 
war. 

Many of the Filipinos who used 
to be leaders before the war, hav- 
ing collaborated closely with the 
Japanese, will be discarded and 
new men with new ideas and new 
orientations must take the field of 
public service. The great oppor- 
tunity is given to President Osme- 
na to bring out these new men for 



the new tasks ahead. 

Per Diems 

10. The MAIL has brought up 
the fact that the Philippine gov- 
ernment was relatively too expen- 
sive and wasteful; that there are 
too many unnecessary employees 
and too little work done. It made 
the point that, while the official 
site of the Philippine government 
is in Washington, D. C. and not 
Manila until the Philippines is re- 
conquered, Philippine government 
officials should not be paid per 
diems unless they are out of Wash- 
ington on official business. 

It was found that there were 
officials who were receiving per 
diems because they were away 
from Manila although they were 
in Washington, the official station 
of the government. 

The MAIL was not being per- 
sonal in this conection. It merely 
called attention to an obvious ir- 
regular situation. It was render- 
ing a necessary public service. It 
will present other situations which 
it believes need correction. 

Rehabilitation 

11. The MAIL gave much pub- 
licity to the economic rehabilita- 
tion program for the Philippines 
after the war prepared by Mr. 
Vicente Villamin, believing not 
only in its soundness and timeli- 
ness but also in the fact that its 
author is the foremost Filipino 
economist who has fought for’ the 
economic rights, privileges and 
welffiu-e of the Filipinos in his long 
career in the United States. That 
program is intended to make the 
Philippines stand on the new econ- 
omy of higher wages for the labor- 
er, greater share for the farmer, 
better working conditions, diversi- 
fication of economic activities, rea- 
sonable interest rates and destruc- 
tion of usury and oppression in all 
forms, and greater participation 
of Filipinos in the productive, com- 
mercial, shipping, financial and 
other wealth-producing activities 
in the Philippines. 

Technical Training 

12. ’The MAIL also gave much 
attention to that part of the Villa- 
min rehabilitation program that 
has to do with the selecting and 
training of Filipinos in the United 
States in different trades, occupa- 
tions and profession for work in 
postwar reconstruction in the Phil- 
lippines. 'There are many Filipinos 
in America who are prepared by 
education or experience to under- 
take an effective part in the re- 
building of the Philippines if they 
are given the chance to obtain 
specialized training in the United 
States before the war ends. 

The Philippine government 
hasn’t done anything so far in this 
connection. It has only brought 
government students under its 
roof in Washing^ton and made them 
prepare memoranda or plans after 
the W 2 U*. 

Filipinos outside of the govern- 
ment have not been given a chance 
at all. The most unfortunate fea- 
ture of this situation is that so- 
called Filipino leaders outside of 
the government have proved indif- 
ferent to the program and some 
even opposed it for the only reason 
that the government is not inter- 
ested in the matter. 

The Villamin training program 
calls for the immediate employ- 
ment of Filipinos in the Philippine 
National Bank and other govern- 
ment institutions in the United 
States and the selection of Filipi- 
nos for training as diplomats, con- 
suls and trade commissioners. It 
also .suggests that the U. S. Navy 
Department be asked to admit 
Filipinos as naval officers and that 
more Filipinos be employed in the 
merchant marine. 

It is earnestly and devoutly to be 
hoped that this program, if nothing 
else, will be undertaken immedi- 
ately and enthusiastically by the 
government. 

Filipino Problems 

13. The MAIL, as always, has 
fought for the rights and well- 
being of Filipinos in the United 
States, encouraged social prog- 
ress, battled against discrimina- 
tions of all kinds, made every Fili- 
pino conscious and proud of their 
Filipino blood and name, mini- 
mized the strains and stresses be- 
tween Filipino groups, promoted 
their availability for positions of 
responsibility, and in general stood 
for those things that the Filipino 
people would like the Filipinos 
abroad to stand for — Filipinism in 
work, in conduct, in thought and 
in apsirations. 

The MAIL wil never deviate an 
iota from this policy. On the 
contrary, it will intensify it and 
work for it without let or hinder- 
ance at any and all times. 

14. A safe and business-like sys- 



BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES-: 
President Sergio Osmena 

On August 1, 1944 , Sergio Osmena took his oath as the 
second President of the Philippines. It is fitting indeed that at 
this time when American-Philippine relations are closer than j 
ever before, the man, who above all others, has been the expo-, 
nent of Filipino collaboration with America should become the . 
President of the Philippines. ^ 



Sergio Osmena was born Sep- 
tember 9, 1878, in the island of 
Cebu, one of the central islands 
in the Philippine archipelago. He 
studied first at the San Carlos 
Seminary in Cebu, then at San 
Juan de Letran in Manila, and in 
1894 he entered Santos Tomas 
University in Manila, where he 
studied for Uvo years, until the ris- 
ing revolt against Spain put an end 
to his studies. 

During the troubled period be- 
tween 1896 and 1902, Osmena was 
first a newspaper writer and then 
publisher of a newspaper in Cebu. 
In 1903 he was admitted to the bar 
in Manila and returned to Cebu to 
practise. He soon commenced his 
political career — was provincial 
fiscal (prosecuting attorney) of 
Cebu, and in 1906 he was elected 
provincial governor. 

He was then only twenty-eight 
yeeirs old, and comparatively inex- 
perienced as a public official Nev- 
ertheless, he possessed the admin- 
istrative ability and political fi- 
nesse, based on genuine under- 
standing and liking for the people, 
of a man of maturer years. 

When he took office he was 
faced with the urgent problem of 
restoring public order. The fer- 
ment of the years of insurrection 
had not yet subsided, and serious 
crop failures contributed to the un- 
rest. Osmena realized that al- 
though the provincial police were 
honest and vigorous in their ef- 
forts to stamp out the disorder, 
they could not succeed without the 
cooperation of the municipal en- 
forcement officers and the people 
as a whole. He launched a care- 

tern of savings by Filipinos super- 
vised by the government is advo- 
cated by 'The MAIL. It pointed to 
the impracticability of the plan 
advanced by some Filipino officials 
and suggested a study of the sys- 
tem in vogue among Filipinos in 
Hawaii. 'The possibility of employ- 
ing the savings of Filipinos in Ha- 
waii to finance Filipino farmers on 
the mainland on the basis that is 
mutually secure and advantageous 
is recommended for investigation. 

In conjunction with this and re- 
lated matters of a business charac- 
ter we suggested that the Philip- 
pine National Bank in New York, 
under an extended charter, might 
play an important role. 

Filipino Farmers 

15. The MAIL is urging the or- 
ganization of Filipinos in the 
United States who grow about 
$2,CKX),0()0 worth of farm products 
for the purpose of securing more 
adequate financing on reasonable 
rates of interest, better deal on 
seeds, fertilizers, water, machin- 
ery and other implements, more 
economical marketing products, 
lower land rates and collective and 
all kinds of discrimination. 

The MAIL would like to see bet- 
ter and more solid organization of 
Filipino farm workers with na- 
tional and regional branches and 
local community organizations 
individual protection from any and 
made real agencies of Filipino so- 
cial, civic and patriotic activities. 

Cooperation 

16. The MAIL, while it was cru- 
sading for improvement of condi- 
tions and correction of evils and 
irregularities, has always offered 
its hand of cooperation to the Phil- 
ippine government in all matters 
that would bring good name and 
advantage to itself, to the Filipinos 
in America and to the Filipino 
people back home. Above all, it 
has aways conducted itself as an 
organ of Filipinos, by Filipinos and * 
for Filipinos. 

It is ruled by good faith. It is 
inspired by sincere love of the 
Philippines. It is Filipino to the 
core, Filipino now and forever. 

A new administration under 
President Osmena is just begin- 
ning. Filipinos and Americans 
alike who know Mr. Osmena and 
have faith in his integrity, fairness 
and statesmanship hope that there 
will be changes in the government 
for the better. It is expected that 
there will be a regime of liberal- 
ism and constructiveness as well 



fully planned public education pro- ^ 
gram in which he himself took ac^, 
tive part, even paying a good 
share of the expenses out of his 
own pocket. 

In the course of his campaign, 
Osmena persuaded the leader of 
one of the most notorious armed 
bands to come to his home for an ; 
interview. His capture would have 
been a great feather in Osmena’s 
cap. A lesser man would have 
considered it fair geune to seize 
him by any means of trickery. But 
Osmena had given his word, cUid , 
he would not break it; nor would 
he urge the bandit to surrender 
with promises of pardon because 
he did not know whether the Gov- 
ernor General would grant it. In- 
stead he let the man go, because, 
as he wrote to the Governor Gen- 
eral: "Of course I was unable to 
give promises that I was not sure 
of being able to keep.” 

Osmena's fairness and firmness 
restored order in Cebu — "a situa- 
tion that has not before existed 
within the memory of living peo- 
ple,” according to the report of 
the Philippine Commission. 

From the beginning, Osmena ad- 
vocated the eventual independence 
of the Philippines. In 1902 he was 
the member of a group which peti- 
tioned Governor-General Taft for 
permission to form a political par- 
ty advocating independence. At 
that time, the United States civil 
authorities opposed the formation 
of independence parties and per- 
mission was refuse^. In 1906, when 
the first (Convention of Provincial 
Governors was held in Manila, Os- 
mena was one of the small group 
of five governors who openly urged 
eventual independence. Neverthe- 
less, although he belonged to the 
small minority group, he was 
elected Fh^sident of the Conven- 
tion. 

When the restriction against 
pro-independence parties was lifted 
preceding the elections for the first 
Philippine Assembly in 1907, Os- 
mena and other leaders formed 
the Nacionalista Party, which 
elected an overwhelming majority 
of the members of the new body. 
Osmena was elected Speaker of 
the Assembly. 

'Two yawning pitfalls lay before 
the new legislative body. It could 
have docilely followed the cue of 
the American officials, assuming 
little or no responsibility for the 
conduct of the government; or it 
could have adopted purely ob- 
structionist tactics, fighting the 
American officials on every point, 
and in the end accomplishing no- 
thing. 'That it avoided both dan- 
gers and became a responsible and 
effective legislative body was due 
largely to the wisdom and ability 
of Speaker Osmena. 

J. R. Hayden, writes in his "The 
Philippines, A Study in National 
Development”: 

“Astute, patient, tenacious, 
skilled in the delicate art of com- 
posing differences, and arranging 
compromises between his col- 
leagues, this young Assemblyman 
showed positive genius in parlia- 
mentary leadership. More impor- 
tant still, the Speaker not only 
thought faster and operated more 
smoothly, but he worked far hard- 
er thaq any other member of the 
Assembly. By sheer industry he 
made himself the master of every 
important problem to be dealt 
with. Chairman of committees 
found that he knew more about 
their special fields of legislation 
than they themselves did. Build- 
ing up the best private library on 
government and politics in the 
Philippines, he broadened his out- 
look and formed statesmanlike cri- 
teria of judgement. Less gifted 
members naturally turned to him 
for guidance and help. His charm 
and tact made his suggestions easy 
to accept.” pp. 170-171' 

The Philippine Assembly adopt- 
ed almost entirely the parliamen- 
tary rules of the Fifty-ninth Con- 
gress of the United States. In two 
respects it actually anticipated im- 
portant reforms in the rules of the 
American Clongress. 'The first de- 
viation was the provision for one 
Appropriation Committee of twen- 



as of good-will and unselfish serv- 
ice. We trust that those who will 1 ty-five members, most of whom 
be called upon by President Osme - 1 were chairmen of other commit- 
na to cooperate with him will do j tees. The Congress of the United 
their best, obsen^e discipline and States did not adopt this proce- 
uphold an unsullied patriotism. j (Continued on Page 6)

Voice From The Forgotten People 

By SEVERING E. RUSTE 

The present set-up of the Filipino Inter-G)mmunity Organi- 
zation of the Western States is clearly shown in the above 
diagram No. 2. This diagram also speaks for the historical de- 
velopment of our organized Filipino Communities. Filipino 
Communities such as that of the community bf San Francisco,

lejo, Watsonville and many others 
before the public eyes in the days 
of the late Hon. Francisco Varona. 

Then came the next stage of de- 
velopment in the political affairs 
of our Inter-Community: the sud- 
den appearance of the West Coast 
Agency, a branch of the Resident 
Commissioner in Washington, D.C. 

The West Coast Agency as we 
all remember was headed by Dr. 
M. D. Bautista with Mr. C. T. 
Alfafara. as secretary. The Fili- 
pinos, west of the Rockies know 
that the West Coast Agency was 
created to serve our people here 
on the Pacific Coast. In what ca- 
pacity, that, perhaps even today, 
is not quite dear. No doubt we 
need this Agency here on the 
Coast. For what purpose? This 
article offers an answer. 

The third Inter-Community Con- 
vention held in Oakland proved a 
march to progress by the adoption 
of its Constitution. It was made 
obviously clear that the Filipino 
Inter - Community Organization 
was no longer a temporary round 
table conference of delegates, but 
a permanent set-up that will crys- 
talize problems of our people with 
a view to solving them. Up to 
this time each individual commu- 
nity looked upon the West Coast 
Agency as its protector. The pres- 
tige of the Agency was high, for in 
all social affairs of every Filipino 
Community the Officers of the 
Agency were present or invited to 
be present. That explains the 
heav'y lines that connects the of- 
fice of the Nationals Division and 
the Filipino Communities in dia- 
gram 2. 

Since the Filipino Inter-Com- 
munity organization became a per- 
manent set-up, it started to make 
itself important to every organ- 
ized Filipino Community. The 
Filipino Inter-Community organi- 
zation has very little power over 
its member communities. That 
power comes in a form of repre- 
sentation of delegates from each 
organized community in the Annu- 
al Convention and through the fee 
and dues that each Filipino Com- 
munity agrees to pay. It is pub- 
licly known that the prestige of 
the Filipino Inter-Community Or- 
ganization with each organized 
community is negligible compared 
with that of the West Coast 
Agency. That again is clearly 
shown by the thin lines that bind 
each community with the office 
of the Filipino Inter-Community 
Organization as indicated in dia- 
gram No, 2. 

It is also publicly known that a 
certain official of our National 
Division with the support of some 
Filipino leaders on the Pacific 
Coast is anxious to see that the 
Inter-Community Organization as 
a permanent orgcmization with its 
constitution be dissolved. 

In the mind of these men the 
only sort of organization that the 
Filipinos on the Pacific Coast can 
be trusted is no more than a con- 
ference of delegates meeting an- 
nually to survey facts and to rec- 
ommend problems of major im- 
portance. 

Attempts had been made in the 
past by these men through under- 
handed methods to dissolve the 
Filipino Inter-Community Organi- 
zation but to no success. Those 
who were opposed to the existence 
of the Filipino Inter-Community 
Organization see only one more 
chance to carry their objective of 



destruction. And that is by fur- 
ther we^ening the prestige and 
the relationship of the Inter-Com- 
munity Organization with each or- 
ganized community. This had been 
done by inducing the President of 
the Filipino Inter-Community Or- 
ganization to do as little as pos- 
sible of what was expected of that 
office for the organized commu- 
nities. 

A weak President can easily be 
a victim of this method. A good 
example of this case is the Test 
Case with regard to real estate 
property. Whereas this case was 
to ^ handled by the Filipino Com- 
munity of San Jose as approved by 
the Inter-Community Ctonventiqn 
held in Stockton, it was finally 
taken off from the Community of 
San Jose by some arrangement 
between the President of the Fili- 
pino Inter-Community Organiza- 
tion and the Office of the Nation- 
als Division. 

The important question now 
arises: What is the significance 
of this sudden shift of respwn- 
sibility ? 

Under the Filipino Commu- 
nity of San Jose the test case 
can come out in the open and be 
given proper publicity. Since it is 
not merely the objective of the 
test case to give the Filipinos in 
California the right to own land, 
though it is true, that is the ulti- 
mate goal, the real purpose of the 
test case was to make the Ameri- 
can public in California conscious 
and responsible as to what atti- 
tude and procedure they may take: 
whether Filipinos in California are 
as desirable as other nationals or 
as undesirable as the Japanese. 

If there is any other time to 
have a show down, it is now and 
not tomorrow. For we either stay 
here or go home after the war, 
that is the issuoi 

While the case is now to be 
handled by some joint effort of the 
Nationals Division and the Presi- 
<lent of the Filipino Inter-Com- 
munity Organization, the case 
shall be carried under secrecy and 
no publicity shall be given, because 
the Nationals Division had not 
been created to change the law of 
the land in which she is only en- 
joying diplomatic immunity. There- 
fore even if the case is won under 
the support of the Nationals Divi- 
sion, the American public shall 
never know and the American Peo- 
ple could continue to practice their 
racial disposition by regarding the 
Filipinos as undesirable elements. 

Obviously this incident brought 
out to the surface two important 
elements that we should not over- 
look. One iS clear. The Presi- 
dent of the Filipino Inter-Com- 
munity Organization by his con- 
sent w’eakens his Office’s prestige 
with each organized community. 
Diagram 2 shows the weak con- 
nection that the Office of the Fili- 
pino Inter-Community • Organiza- 
tion has with each Filipino Com- 
munity. By the present action of 
the President this connection is 
made weaker still. The Filipinos 
in every Organized Community ex- 
pect that under the set-up as 
shown in diagram 2 and under a 
strong president, each Community 
shall be pulled by its feet tow'ard 
the sphere of the Filipino Inter- 
community Organization. This 
will bring a direct show-down 
against the Office of the Nationals 
Division. Consequently the Office 
of the Nationals Division would 



SEVERING E. RUSTE 

tend to pull harder and harder 
each organized community by their 
necks toward her. Therefore un- 
der a strong President with our 
present set-up two things can hap- 
pen: 

Either the ties with the Nation- 
als Division arc completely broken; 
or the Filipino Communities arc 
split into two camps — those who 
will pledge obedience to the Na- 
tionals Division and those who Nvill 
remain loyal to the Filipino Inter- 
community Organization. On the 
other hand under a weak Presi- 
dent, the ties each Community has 
with the Filipino Inter-Commu- 
nity Organization are dissolved 
and leave the Nationals Division 
the real champion. 

For those Filipinos and Filipino 
leaders who believed that Filipinos 
in America should be hooked by 
their nose and dragged along as 
our native population at home, the 
defeat of the Filipino Inter-Com- 
munity Organization — so that the 
Nationals Division shall have com- 
plete dominion over the political, 
social and economic life of the 
Filipinos on the Pacific Coast — is 
indeed the dearest wish in their 
hearts. 

But those Filipinos and Filipino 
leaders who wish to see the Fili- 
pinos here in the United States 
united in order to be able to fight 
solidly our political rights for bet- 
ter and fair economic existence of 
our people and for greater pres- 
tige, would rather die in the field 
of battle for a permanent exist- 
ence of the Filipino Inter-Com- 
munity Organization. 

Therefore, to avoid either of 
these catastrophies, a weak Presi- 
dent on one hand where the Inter- 
community is dissolved, or a 
strong President on the other, 
where the organized communities 
are split — I am now submitting a 
new set-up defining the position 
and relationship that each Com- 
munity has with the Filipino Inter- 
community Organization and with 
the Nationals Division's Office. 
This set-up is clearly defined in 
diagram No. 1. In this plan the 
organized communities look upon 
ganization for prestige and protec- 
the Filipino Inter-Community Or- 
tion. The Inter-Cbmmunity Or- 
ganization shall rule and guide 
each organized community. It 
shall defend each organized com- 
munity and help them in their 
needs. For all problems that each 
cannot solve the Filipino Inter- 
community Organization shall be 
asked to give its assistance. 'There- 
fore, there will be only one channel 
between tlie Communities and the 
outside world and that is clearly 
pointed out by heavy lines in dia- 
gram 1. However there are many 
problems that the Filipino Oonr* 
munities may face that can be 
solved through diplomatic chan- 
nels. In such cases the Filipino 
Inter - Community Organization 
submits the problems of the Fili- 
pino Community in question to the 
branch of the Nationals Division 
on the Pacific Coast. The dotted 
lines between the Nationals Divi- 
sion and the Filipino Inter-Com- 
munity Organization in diagram 1 
clarifies this relationship. Cbn- 
sequently while the Filipino Inter- 
community Organization serves as 
the father of all organized com- 
munities, the Nationals Division 
behaves as the grandfather. This 
is an harmonious solution. It joins 
two forces and ser\’es only one 
master. 

I hope that the delegates’ minds 
may be enlightened by this humble 
exposition of the problems con- 
fronting our convention, a At this 
point I wish to make still easier 
the burden of the delegates with- 
out sacrificing any political career 
by allowing me to present the fol- 
lowing amendments to the Con- 
stitution of the Filipino Inter- 
community. The amendments are 
as follows: 

Amendment I. — 'Tn order to 
make each Filipino Community as- 
sume an actual part in the con- 
vention, besides taking part in the 
deliberations of the Convention, I, 
therefore, move that certain ar- 
ticles and sections of the Inter- 
Community's Constitution be 
amended so that the Officers of 
the Inter-Community shall only be

Dr. Baldorla To 
Lead The Filipino 
Valley Farmers 

It is generally believed that Dr. 
Pedro Baldoria. a farmer near Los 
Angeles, will be the leader of the 
Filipino farmers and growlers in 
their organization. He xvill be 
helped by other farmers, among 
them are Messrs. Arciago, Magum- 
cia, Dollente, Castanieto, Obra, 
Tobilleja, Sampayan and others in 
Stockton, Watsonville, Fresno and 
other places. 

'The general, plan is for Filipino 
farmers and growers to organize 
themselves into one big gnnoup with 
local groups to consider ways and 
means of improxing their financial 
position and tackling with other 
problems like marketing and the 
like. 

They have xvatched the work of 
The MAIL in this connection and 
they are impressed by its sugges- 
tions. (We direct attention to the 
front-page article on the subject in 
the present issue — Editor.) 

It is expected that farmers at- 
tending the Inter-Community Con- 
vention at Fresno will put their 
heads together and advance the 
date of the meeting of the farmers 
and growers.

WASHINGTON, D. C. — Since 
President Osmena took the oath 
of office on August 1, it is reported 
that “Osmena men” either ap- 
peared personally or wrote from 
all points of the compass. They 
all said that they have been “for 
Mr. Osmena all the time" during 
the life of President Quezon, When 
asked where they were when the 
question of Presidential Succession 
was being fought out in Washing- 
ton and why they didn’t show their 
colors then when Mr. Osmena had 
so few open supporters, they said 
that while they were not heard 
from their “hearts were in the 
right place.” 

The real supporters of President 
Osmena. those who had the guts 
to be in opposition to President 
Quezon and therefore punished by 
him with ostracism, are not heard 
from, strange to say. They are 
his sincere and brave supporters, 
men who are for the country and 
for their convictions, men who do 
not look for favors or compensa- 
tions for their patriotic work. 

It is to be hoped that the 
“Osmena men” who have mush- 
roomed into existence since Presi- 
dent Quezon died are closely in- 
vestigated before they are given 
any post of responsibility in the 
government. 



One Bill Costello doesn’t like Filipinos and he doesn’t be- 
lieve in their loyalty to the U.S.A. By direa statements and 
innuendo he attacks Filipinos and their leaders. He must be 
looking for trouble. Filipinos, who are with the U.S.A. 100%, 
will not tolerate unfair and foul attacks upon themselves. Cos- 
tello is sowiqg seeds of discord. He must stop.

reprinted as follows with the com- 
ment of The mail’s editor in pa- 
rentheses: 

'"rhe State Department will face 
one of the worst dilemmas of its 
history when the time comes, per- 
haps late this year, to reestablish 
a Filipino government sympathetic 
to the United States.” (Tlie Act 
of Congress of June 29, 1944 au- 
thorizes the organization of the 
independent Philippine Republic 
after the President of the U. S. 
shall have proclaimed that consti- 
tutional processes have been es- 
tablished. Costello's fears spring 
from both ignorance and unjusti- 
fied distrust of Filipinos.) 

“During the siege of Bataan, the 
Filipino army distinguished itself 
under General MacArthur. Ameri- 
cans pointed proudly to their ex- 
ploits as an example of the loyalty 
which could be inspired among 
backward peoples by a policy of 
enlight^ed imperialism.” (Cos- 
tello doesn’t know or doesn’t care 
to know that Filipinos fought not 
only out of loyalty and gratitude 
to the U. S. but also to uphold the 
principles of freedom, decency and 
independence. There were many 
Filipino officers, including Gener- 
als, in the army that fought the 
Japs. And, Costello, why bring 
up the matter of the “backward 
peoples” and its sneering implica- 
tions ? ) 

“What most Americans do not 
know is that, once Ctorregidor had 
fallen, practically every former 
Philippine official became a Jap- 
anese collaborator. They rushed 
to get on the Japanese bandwagon 
and with complete naivete ac- 
cepted the American defeat as 
final.” ('This paragraph simply 
shows that Costello has a crooked 
brain. Filipinos did not become 
collaborators on their own voli- 
tion: they were ordered by the 
Japs, and non-compliance would 
have meant death. If they didn’t 
run the government, the Japs 
would have done it, and that would 
be tragedy. Filipinos, by educa- 
tion, inclination and choice are for 
the U. S. and against Japan. Cos- 
tello lies wickedly when he says 
that Filipinos rushed to get on the 
Jap bandwagon and underrates 
maliciously the intelligence and 
character of Filipinos when he 
says that they consider American 
defeat as final.) 

“The question now is what to do 
with the collaborators when the 
Philippine government is recon- 
stituted.” (The Philippine gov- 
ernment once constituted will take 



the Costello stripe. It so happens 
that according to the Constitution 
of the puppet Philippine goveni- 
ment, once the war is terminated, 
that government will give way to a 
new government that shall be es- 
tablished under the auspices of the 
U. S.) 

“Almost the only Filipino offi- 
cial who is untainted is the gue- 
rilla leader Tomas Confesor, for- 
mer governor of Iloilo province on 
Panay, who is a political unknown 
in many parts of the archipelago. 
Most of the others revealed strong 
pro- Japanese leanings as soon as 
American control vanished.” (Cos- 
tello says Gov. Osnfesor is the only 
pure one because he has not taken 
the trouble of finding out the com- 
plete facts. All confidential re- 
ports are that the loyalty of Fili- 
pinos to the U. S. remains un- 
shaken and all they need is for the 
American forces to come and re- 
conquer the islands from the Japs 
and they will join in the redemp- 
tion of their country from the 
heathen, immoral, unmoral, inde- 
cent and unprincipled Japs. Fili- 
pinos are Catholics and basically 
against the Jap ethics.) 

“Congress and the Administra- 
tion are eager to restore a strong 
native government as soon as pos- 
sible after the Japanese are rooted 
out, but if the collaborators are 
refused a place, there will be few 
men of stature capable of filling 
their shoes.” (Costello’s ignor- 
ance of Filipinos is abysmal. There 
are a great many Filipinos outside 
of the government and not in pub- 
lic life that he hasn’t heard about 
that can carry on the work of 
governing the Philippines. Cos- 
tello’s knowledge of Filipinos is 
restricted to the relatively few 
politicians that have come to 
Washington. If after the war the 
Philippines is not afflicted with 
the presence of men of the men- 
tality of Costello they will get 
along all right.) 

“President Manuel Quezon dom- 
inated the only political party in 
the islands and there is no such 
thing as a ’loyal opposition’ party 
to draw from.” (Some more of 
Costello’s ignorance which he ex- 
ploits to make a case against Fili- 
pinos in order that they may be 
unpopular in the U. S. and per- 
haps withhold 2 uiy aid to them in 
the future in the reconstruction of 
their country. Quezon’s party, it 
is true, has been in power for a 
long time, longer than many en- 
lightened Filipinos would like to 
see, but an ever-increasing con- 
sciousness of democratic processes 
is possessing the minds of the peo- 
ple and an opposition party was

STOCKTON, Calif.— On Sunday, 
July 2, 1944, the Post War Plan- 
ning Committee of the Caballeros 
de Dimas Alang, Inc. gave a lunch- 
eon at the Clark Hotel in Stockton 
to mark the official opening of the 
Bayan Dimas Alang Campaign. 
C. T. Alfafara, Grand Master of 
the Order, introduced the five 
members of the Post War Plan- 
ning Committee, who are: J. B. 
Sampayan, Chairman, from Sali- 
nas; M. G. Layugan, Treasurer, 
from Castroville; B. R. Losada, 
Watsonville; Felipe Inocencio, Los 
Angeles, and Pio de Cano, Seattle, 
Washington. Mr. Inocencio and 
Mr. Losada were not able to be 
present. 

Mr. Alfafara presented Mr. Sam- 
payan as the only speaker of the 
occcLsion, who spoke as follows: 
“Honorable Grand Master, Broth- 
ers, Ladies and Friends: 

"We are gathered here today in 
this beautiful city of Stockton to 
launch one of the greatest under- 
takings ever to be attempted by 
Filipinos in the United States and 
Hawaii for helping to industrial- 
ize, rehabilitate and nationalize 
the Philippines in the post-war 
period of her economic reconstruc- 
tion. 

"In the past, our beloved coun- 
try has been partly developed in- 
dustrially, economically and com- 
mercially mainly through foreign 
capital. Filipino participation along 
these lines has been only of recent 
years and to a limited capacity. 
Our forests, mines, fisheries, aba- 
ca. cocoanut and sugar plantations 
were mostly exploited by foreign- 
ers. The Filipinos because of lack 
of their own capital had to accept 
outside capital to develop the na- 
tural resources of our national 
wealth. We all realize now as we 
then realized, the reasons why 
Filipinos should participate to a 



greater extent in our Philippine 
Economic rehabilitation after the 
war when peace has been estab- 
lished. 

“Because of the pleasant situa- 
tion of Filipinos in the United 



Somewhere in Australia 
Dear Editor Cruz: 

On June 4 marked the climax 
of a real Filipino festivity. Al- 
ready dignitaries from both civil- 
ians and the Army had assured 
their presence to share with us in 
the fun and gayety that made the 
affair lively. There were speeches 
but were short for music, songs 
and dances were the major part of 
the program. 

The WACS, the Red Ooss girls 
and a number of Australian beau- 
ties were here too to add glamour 
to the occasion. It was really a 
riot of fun, for here is a group of 
men many of which were veterans 
in the realm of entertainment. 

Heightened by an old Filipino 
custom which had come down 
through the ages, and which still is 
being observed throughout the 
Philippines is the “Salo-Salo” 
party that was simply unique. 

To Filipinos, a “Salo-Salo" is 
more than a party. It is a com- 
munity affair wherein everyone 
shares in making it a success. One 
contributes whatever he wishes to 
givCv One may bring with him 
chickens, others may bring with 
them wine, rice, fish, vegetables, 
fruits, spices, etc. ’These offer- 
ings are pooled together, and 
cooked to perfection by culinary 
experts. While the food simmers 
over the fire, the crowd makes 
merriment with music and games. 
'The gayety is supplemented by the 
serving of succulent dishes pre- 
pared in abundance. 

The highlight of the fiesta comes 
during the selection of a “LAKAM- 
BINI,” the fairest among the fair- 
est present. The chosen one — 
usually endowed with great charm 
— presides over the festival and, 
for that day, is the QUEEN of her 
people. 

'The celebration was a great af- 
fair of the day. 

Very sincerely, 

Sgt. MIGUEL E. IGNACIO 



Establishment Of Legionaries 

Home Approved In Regional Meet 



Famous Manila 
Artist Now At 






In their regional meetings held , 
recently throughout the State, the 
members of the Legionarios del 
Trabajo in America, Inc. approved 
the establishment of Legionarios 
Home in America. The site of this 
home has not been decided but as 
soon as the funds are available the 
members will meet again to decide 
it. 

The maintenance of this home is 
dependent upon another project 
which has been approved also in 
the Regional Meetings. This proj- 
ect is the purchase of Farm-lands 
by the Fraternity. 'These farm 
lands are to be leased to members 
of the Fraternity or others who 
are interested in farming. The pro- 
ceeds will go to the treasury for 
the support of the home. 

The proposed home will house 
the Offices of the Supreme Fra- 



They are a part of the platform 
for which the present administra- 
tion has been elected. As soon as 
these projects are started, the Fra- 
ternity will start on its Bond Drive

Fortress to be given to Gen Mac- 
Arthur, a proposition approved in 

the last Convention.

Republicans Pass 
Up Philippines 
In Platform 



SAN FRANCISCO— In a state- 
ment given to the Associated Press,

and economist, after he«u:ing on the 



radio the Republican Platform 
tonal Council, Jhe by Senator Robert Taft. 

chairman of the platform commit- 



body of the organization. Mainly, 
however, it will serve as home of 
aged members who have main- 
tained faithful membership for so 
many years. It will also accom- 
modate other members who are 
in need of help. 

'The ultimate establishment of 
this home of the Legionarios del 
Trabajo is the fulfillment of a de- 
sire that has been seeking expres- 
sion in the heart of every member 
for a long time. Its realization at 
this time is very timely. First, be- 
cause many members are fast ap- 
proaching middle age and beyond 



tee, expressed disappointment that 
“while Hawaii, Puerto Rico and 

Alaska were mentioned, the Philip- 
pines and its future was entirely 
omitted.” 

The Republican party in the 
past, he said, was identified with 
opposition to independence and its 
silence in the last platform that 
will mention the Philippines will 
give rise to the speculation that 
once in power it might amend or 
repeal the law granting indepen- 
dence to the Philippines. “At least, 



into the winter of life when old ‘that’s what the Japanese will tell 
age will creep in and prevent them | Filipinos to alienate them from 
from earning a livelihood. Second, United States,” he declared.

States and Hawaii, and the great 
advantages and possibilities of 
earning higher wages during this 
war-time, they can now save the 
major portion of their earnings, if 
they so desire. 'These savings 
when pooled, will provide capital 
for various enterprises. We can 
all see that in order to rehabilitate 
the Philippines economically, 
American capital will be needed 
and we Filipinos might as well own 
part of that capital. It is to this 
desire and thought that the mem- 
bers of the Caballeros de Dimas- 
Alang are determined to save co- 
operatively for the formation of a 
corporation. 

It is indeed a great honor for 
me to have been among the five 



appointed by the Grand Master to 
plan for the future activities of 
the corporation to be established 
in our country. With the excep- 
tiort of Bro. Felipe Inocencio and 
Bro. C. T. Alfafara, none of the 
members have college degrees, but 
surely we have men in this Post- 
War Planning Committee who 
have been trained in the school of 
practical experience. This com- 
mittee, however, is only charged 
with the planning of tentative 
steps towards the realization of 
our aims and aspirations. When 
the corporation is finally formed 
and ready to do business in the 
Philippines, a Board of Directors 
elected by the stockholders will 
direct the operations of the cor- 
poration. 

We have within the ranks and 
files of the membership of the 
Caballeros de Dimas-Alang, Inc., 
men with ample educational quali- 
fications and sufficient background 
and practical experience to be de- 
pended upon to direct^ our future 
activities. 

Many of our countrymen in this 
country who have prepared them- 
selves in various trades and occu- 
pations or may have training in 
business administration, may be- 
come interested in this project. 
Such men would be welcome to our 
fraternity should they desire to 
help in our tentative project, as 
participation in Bayan Dimas- 
Alang is strictly limited to mem- 
bers of our Order only. 

I have talked to many of our 
countrymen, both members and 
non-members. They all express 
their desire to return to our coun- 
try when the war is over and 
peace is declared. Their nostalgic 
feelings are being felt and they 
are willing to share in the big task 
of economic reconstruction in the 
Philippines. 



because in this time of golden op- 
portunity most of the members 
are earning high wages. 

The wisdom of these proposi- 
tions is based upon the principles 
of love and brotherhood and in the 
light of facts obtained from the 
situation. The main idea is to al- 
leviate human suffering that might 
befall the members in the future. 
The Fraternity intends to help pre- 
vent the possible occurrence of in- 
flation by siphoning as much as 
it can of the large sum flowing 
into the pockets of its members 
and putting over a concrete pro- 
gram both now and after the war 
to stabilize the lives of its rank 
and file. 

These propositions of farm-lands 
and Legionarios Home are direct 
results of the Convention of the 
Order held recently in Stockton. 



Attorney Villamin further said 
that it would have been most re- 
assuring if the Republican plat- 
form had said something about 
helping the reconstruction of the 
Philippines after the war. Its fail- 
ure to do so would again give 
rise to the speculation that the 
Republican party, in which the 
ag^ricultural bloc of States will be 
powerful, would not be as liberal 
and genereous to the Philippines. 

At least the Republican party 
which started the American Phil- 
ippine experiment could have said 
some words of commendation of 
the Filipinos’ loyalty and coopera- 
tion in the war and emphasized 
that that experiment would end 
under its administration with the 
granting of Philippine indepen- 
dence, he said, but it hadn’t done 
so cuid its pretty disappointing. 



Gen. Barrows On 

Island Reeonquest 



General David P. Barrows, for- ^ 
merly president of the University 
of California and Philippine Direc-- - 
tor of Education, said: 

“It now seems fairly certain that 
Cxen. MacArthur’s return to the 
Philippines Nvill begin with the re- 
conquest of Mindanao and Sulu. 
The Moros will be the first peo- 
ples liberated from the Japanese 
conquerors. In the fighting task 
of dri'ving out the Japanese the 
Moros can, and probably will, par- 
ticipate with MacArthur’s Ameri- 
can Army.'

ANN ARBOR. MICHIGAN— 

Eduardo Salgado, outstanding 
young Manila artist, is now con- 
nected with the University of Mi- 
chigan here and his sculpture, 
“Liberation of the Philippines.” 
has attracted widespread praise as 
a feature of the University’s fif- 
teenth annual exhibition of sculp- 
ture. 

The study presents a girl, rep- 
resenting The Philippines, with 
chained hands freed. She is rising, 
aspiring, hoping. Close beside her 
is the American eagle, symbol of 
the redeemer of the oppressed. . 
War weapons, skull and palm leaf 
are woven into the theme to sug- , 
gest the rise and decline of na- 
tions. 'The girl is looking forward 
to rebirth, progress and prosperity. 

Salgado was graduated with 
honors from the University of the 
Philippines in 1931, where he 
studied art under Prof. Fernando 
C.' Amorsolo. He left 'The Islands 
in 1940, and is currently a scien- 
tific illustrator at the University 
of Michigan museum, and a spe- 
cial student of sculpture under 
Dr. Avard T. Fairbanks, noted 
American artist and professor of 
that subject at the University’s 
Institue of Fine Arts. Mr. Sal- 
gado, formerly a teacher in the V 
public sc hools of Manila, is study- 
ing at the University under a fine 
. rts scholarship. 

Oils and water colors by the 
young artist have been shown in 
several American galleries, and are 
now on exhibit at the University 
of Montana.

LDT ENDS SVCCESSFUL CONVENTION 



Officials of Supreme 
Fraternal Council 
Retain Same Posts 



Oakland, nov. i 9, iPPAi — 
With the tinkling of gleisscs, drink- 
ing to the health of the elected 
officers of the Supreme Fraternal 
Council for the term 1946-47, the 
17th Convention of the Legionarios 
Del Trabajo in America, which 
was held in Oakland for five days, 
came to a close yesterday. Grand 
Delegate Felipe Esteban, as he 
adjourned the last session, invited 
all the remaining members at the 
hall to go upstairs for "a little 
treat’*! And there was champagne 
and other amber-colored "spirits”. 
The confab w'as marked with satis- 
factory results. 

The more than 250 delegates 
were satisfied with and approved 
the financial report of R. Bartolo- 
ine Navarro. Grand Treasurer, as 
well as the reports of Grand Secre- 
tary’ Jesus Savella" and Grand 
Delegate Felipe Esteban. The ad- 
ministration was highly praised 
and as proof of that satisfaction, 
Elsteban was reelected by 160 out 
of 212 accredited votes: while 
Savella and Navarro were reelec- 
ted by acclamation. Hugo Castan- 
eda, Noli Me Tangere Lodge. San 
Francisco and Cesar Avila, Eureka 
Lodge. Isleton, were the other can- 
didates for Grand Delegate. Silv- 
erio Recta. Corregidor Lodge, Sali- 
nas. w'as elected Grand Auditor. 
Esteban. Savella belong to Kala- 
pati Lodge, Oakland, and Navarro 
is of General Luna Lodge, Stock- 
ton. 

Alberto Dublin replaced Pedro 
Jasmin as assistant grand dele- 
gate of the northern district, and 
FYancisco Gaspar succeeded him- 
self as assistant grand delegate, 
southern district. Ehiblin is wor- 
shipful master of Mactan Lodge, 
Livingston, and Gaspar is a mem- 
ber of Los Angeles Lodge, Los 
Angeles. Tw^o other Los Angeles 



Lodge members were elected as 
assistant grand secretary. Severe 
Dizon, and assistant grand auditor, 
Mapuel Hidalgo. Domingo de la 
Rosa, Jordan Lodge, Oxnard, came 
out assistant grand treasurer. 

Much credit is due the Commis- 
sary Committee, chairmanned by 
Cirilo Gacula, Kalapati Lodge, 
with brothers of that Lodge and of 
Perla del O r i e n t e and Leyte 
Lodges as members; and the Hous- 
ing Committee, whose chairman 
was Domingo Gapuz, Kalapati 
Lodge, and the members were 
other brothel’s from the same two 
lodges named. 

The next Convention, the 18th 
• 3rd biennial), will be held some- 
time in the fall of 1947, in the 
raisin city of Fresno.

other things. However, the Filipino 
people are not blind and dub as 
the Osmena men think and they 
know that Osmena has very, very 
little to do with the preparation 
of the bills in question.

.Albert Dublin is the new assistant 
grand delegate for the northern

of the Legionarios and a very ac- 
iive and consistent member all the 
years since his initiation into the 
Order. He was formerly with Dag-

been Worshipful Master of that

Revolf In Indonesia 
Subject Of Broadcast 



SA NFRANCISCO - FPA) On 
Nov, 10, 1945, listeners of KSFO 
heard the regular coast to coast 
broadcast of the California Coun- 
cil on the question "Revolt in 
Indonesia". Tlie guests of moder- 
ator Stuart Ward were Mrs. Est- 
ela R. Sullt, His Excellency the 
Hon. Puffin, Consul for Great 
Britain in San Francisco, Dr. Fox- 
worthy, Consultant Professor of 
the University of California and 
Editor Scott Newhall of the 
Chronicle Magazine, 'FIIIS 
WORLD. The broadcast was very 
timely and rather ticklish, con- 
sidering the position taken by the 
British Empire in the Indonesian 
problem, and Mrs. Sulit was the 
only native of the Far East to take 
part in the discussion and site de- 
fended the a.spiralions of the small- 
er Far East peoples. 



Rose is a man of recognized ad- 
ministrative and executive ability. 
His experience in labor-manage- 
ment relations and other related 
matters is vast. Those who had 
dealings with him speak in the 
most glowing terms of his ability, 
efficiency, tact, and record to get 
things done and get results. 

A giant of a man. the dcneral 
is a good speaker and a ready 
[debater. In conferences he easily 
dominates the situation without 
making the conferees feel that he 
is bulling or forcing issues. He has 
patience as well as the ability to 
keep quiet when words would 
serve naught but intensify feel- 
ings and divide counsels. 

General Rose would make a 
worthy successor to Commissioner 
Paul V. McNutt if the latter is 
called to other duties. He will ably 
fill McNutt’s shoos. In fact, that 
is the expectation ifi government 
circles as well as among those Am- 
ericans and Filipinos in private life 
who are interested in the Philip- 
pines.

WASHINGTON— A well-known 
Filipino Major who is very econ- 
omical with his words and very 
careful not to hurt anybody's feel- 
ings was so exasperated one day 
that ho stated, among other 
things, as follows; "Commissioner 
Carlos Romulo says he is ‘the last 
man off Bataan,’ but that’s a false- 
hood; and he says ‘ we heard it in 
the fox-hole in Bataan.’ but ho 
was never in a fox-hole for he was 
oneratlng for a time a radio in 
Corregidor, etc., etc. xxx ,'!! phst. 








Romulo Appeals 
For War Damages 



WASHINGTON-^Resident Com- 
missioner Carlos P. Romulo made 
a strong appeal to the Senate 
Committee on Territories and In- 
sular Affairs to give the Philip- 
pines generous amounts to cover 
the war damages suffered by the 
Filipinos and others who live in 
the Philippines. 

He stated that it was a matter 
for the voluntary act of the Amer- 
ican Government to make good 
the losses of the Filipinos. He 
stated that after all the Filipino.s 
got involved in the war because of 
the fact that America was sover- 
eign in the Philippines. 

He compared the Philippine case 
to that of Siam. He explained that 
if the Philippines had been an in- 
dependent nation it would have 
been taken by the Japs like Siam 
was, but, like Siam, after Japan 
was defeated by the United Na- 
tions, it would be liberated — and 
without destruction. 

The Commissioner cited Jap 
propaganda lines to prove that 
their appeal was on the grounds 
that their fight was not against 
Ihe Filipinos but against the Am- 
ericans. But, he added, the Fili- 
pinos didn't believe them and stuck 
to the United States and fought 
with the Americans to the last. 



R. Bartolomc Navarro, also has 
been reelected Grand Treasurer. 
For the first time in the long hist- 
ory of the LDT, the grand treasur- 
er's report has been accepted at a 
convention without question. Nav- 
arro stands on that record and 
thus occupies the same office.

MANILA — Speaker Jose Zulu- 
eta lectured and criticized the Fili- 
pino students for staging a public 
demonstration against the law 
which the Philippine Gt>ngress 
passed giving the members of that 
body 3 years of back pay and the 
rest of the government officials 
and employers only 45 days of pay. 

Zulueta is being undemocratic, 
totalitarian, plutocratic and simply 
antc-deluvian. The students exer- 
cised their constitutional right of 
peaceful assemblage to protest; 
and they were protesting against 
one of the most, if not the most, 
immoral, unpatriotic, anti-Filipino 
and insulting laws passed in the 
entire history of the Philippines, 
not even excluding the Spanish era 
of oppression and exploitation. 

A great disappointment and dis- 
gust has settled on most of the 
people when President Osmena, in- 
stead of vetoing the law, approved 
it in Washington. That sealed fin- 
ally his defeat at the polls.

American Army 
Officers Say Roxas 
No Collaborationist 



WASHINGTON— Every Amer- 
ican army officer who knows the 
situation and the personalities in 
the Philippines has declared that 
Gen. Manuel A. Roxas can not be 
considered in any way shape ‘or 
form as a Jap* collaborationist. 
General Dougias MacArthur, after 
examining pertinent documents 
and the circumstances under which 
they were written, has given Roxas 
a clean bill of health. Who else is 
the better judge? 



It is believed that even now that 
President Osmena will release 
when he returns to Manila on his 
"accomplishments in Washingtoa" 
is being prepared. It is also be- 
lieved that the claims will be much 
more than the facts. According to 
the Osmena follou’ers, he Is the 
master mind and master operator 
in Washington, even directing Sen- 
ator Tydings, High Commissioner 
McNutt, Secretary Ickcs and even 
President Truman — which, of 
course, is all the bunk.

with no less than 3(X),(XX) members.

mistaken for the "Democratic Al- 
liance” a group of about I00,(XX) 
members. 

The party seeks a new deal for 
the Filipino common man. It 
stands for higher wages, larger 
share in farm production, loss poli- 
tics and a more prrfperous Philip- 
pines. They want performance and 
no more promises. 

It is against the government for 
its lack of program and action. It 
is against both President Osmena 
and General Manuel A. Roxas. The 
members want new leaders who 
have a concrete program for the 
amelioration of the lot of the Fili- 
pino masses.

Jap collaborationist Vicente Mad-

according to news from Washing- 
ton. 

NEW YORK — Osmena is a great

of thinking Filipinos and they all 
want him to be defeated for re- 
election.

scmbly during the nine years of 
its existence. In 1916, the Con- 
gress of the United States passed 
the Jones Act, which stated spe- 
cifically the intention of the United 
States to give the islands eventual 
independence, gave the nation a 
greater measure of self-govmment, 
and provided for the election of a 
Senate composed of Filipinos. Os- 
mena decided to remain in the 
lower house — renamed the House 
of Representatives — and was 
Speaker of that body until 1922. 

The influence which Osmena 
wielded in the government of the 
Philippines during the period of his 
speakership — 1908 to 1922 — was 
far greater than that of any Amer- 
ican Speaker. In power and pres- 
tige. he was actually second only 
to the Governor General who was 
appointed by the President of the 
United States, and he was able to 
obtain for the Filipinos an ever- 
increasing share in the conduct of 
the government of the Islands. 
Three factors contributed to this: 
first, his official position as Speak- 
er of the low’er house; second, and 
more important, his position as 
the leader of the overwhelmingly 
dominant political party, and third, 
his own persuasive personcdity. 
The American Govemors-General 
respected him and the other lead- 
ers of his party, and consulted him 
not only concerning necessary le- 
g^islation, but also the administra- 
tion of the executive departments. 
In 1918, Governor General Francis 
B. Harrison formalized this ar- 
rangement between the American 
executive branch of the Govern- 
ment and the Filipino legislature 
by creating a Council of State, of 
which he was Chairman and Os- 
mena Vice-Chairman. This Coun- 
cil actually performed the func- 
tions of a cabinet. 

In 1922, Osmena and Quezon had 
a disagreement on the leadership 
question. While Osmena main- 
tained that for the effectiveness of 
the Filipino participation in the 
government a national leadership 
was a political necessity, Quezon 
on the other hand, advocated col- 
lective leadership. This disagree- 
ment led to a split of the Naciona- 
lista Party. However, Osmena and 



to the Act) led by Quezon, and 
the Pros (those in favor of the 
Act) led by Osmena. In the end 
Quezon and the Antis won, and 
on October 17, 1933, the Philippine 
Legislature rejected the Act. 

Although the two main parties 
emerging from the struggle over 
the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act main- 
tained separate identities for sev- 
eral years, Osmena and Quezon 
soon renewed their political coop- 
eration. In 1934, Quezon secured 
the passage by the American Con- 
gress of the Tydings-McDuffie Act 
which contained the provisions of 
the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act with 
some modifications. This Act also 
required the assent of the Philip- 
pine legislature before becoming 
effective. Osmena wholeheartedly 
supported its acceptance, and the 
consent of the Philippine legisla- 
ture was speedily secured. Neither 
Osmena nor Quezon was a candi- 
date for member of the Constitu- 
tional Convention, but (he great 
majority of the members were fol- 
lowers of one or the other. Never- 
theless, party differences as such 
were not carried into the Consti - 
tutional Convention. 

The constitution was drafted and 
approved by the Filipino people 
and by the President of the United 
States and the country made ready 
to elect its first President and Vice 
President under the Common- 
wealth Government. The nation 
was on its way to complete inde- 
pendence in an unsettled and diffi- 
cult world. The new government 
needed all its wise and able lead- 
ers — particularly the two men who 
were, as one American writer says, 
"the greatest Filipinos of their 
generation." So instead of engag- 
ing in a spectacular political bat- 
tle, Osmena and Quezon soberly 
considered the best interests of 
their country and agreed to bury 
their temporary differences. They 
became candidates for Vice Presi- 
dent and President respectively on 
a coalition ticket. This reconcilia- 
tion was much more than a polit- 
ical truce dictated by expediency; 
it was an actual agreement be- 
tween the two great Filipino lead- 
ers to work together for the good 
of their country. About two years 
sifter the elections of 1935, they 
merged their parties, and in 1941 
they were reelected on a single 
party ticket — the Partldo Naclo- 
nallst-a.

ing, the fighting and the dying. 
Mr. Villamin’s interest in the com- 
mon man is not new. The follow- 
ing article by Mr. James G. Wingo 
in the Philippines FREE PRESS 
of June 15, 1935, is reprinted 
below: 

Free Press Article 

“Vicente Villamin’s campaign for 
the Filipino little man is a success. 
He is getting protests — telegraph- 
ic, telephonic, wireless, graphic 
and verbal — from the big buiness- 
men with w’hom the lawyer-econo- 
mist has been more or less identi- 
fied all these many years. 

"What's the big idea?" ask the 
tycoons who have been knocked 
cold. 

" ‘The idea is that I want you to 
distribute to your underfed labor- 
ers, your serf-like farmers and the 
little businessmen who turn in to 
you practically all profits they 
make, additional sum of 50,000,000 
pesos (1 peso is 50 cents) every 
year," he replies. 

" ‘That sum is w'hat is due them 
in addition to what you have been 
doling out to them, I want you to 
give to the Filipino little man his 
full share of the benefits that ac- 
crue from the relations of the 
Philippines %vith the United 
States’." 

Economic Necessity 

"Villamin’s share - the - benefits 
program is not only just and sound 
in principle, but an economic nec- 
essity. As all wage-earners know, 
it is just a matter of a few pesos 
from mere existence to compara- 
tive comfort. 

"Ten pesos a month added to 
what the small wage-earner is 
now getting may enable him to 
buy a newspaper once a week, 

a govemment-in-exile with its 
headquarters in Washington. In- 
stead of asserting his undoubted 
right under the Constitution, Os- 
mena agreed to the consideration 
of the matter not only on purely 
legal grounds byt also on political 
grounds arising from the neces- 
sities of the war. Consequently, 
upon Osmena’s initiative, the Com- 
monwealth (]k)vemment submitted 
the matter to the United States 
Congress for consideration and ac- 
tion. Congress passed a joint reso- 
lution continuing Phresident Quezon 
in office for the duration of the 
war and Osmena readily accepted 
this decision and made an appeal 
to his countryment in these words: 

“Congress, after thorough con- 
sideration, passed the joint resolu- 
tion providing for the continuance 
in office of President Quezon for 
the duration of the war. This 
resolution expresses the considered 
judgment of the American people. 
I accept it without reserve and I 
urge every Filipino, whether in 
the homeland, in continental Unit- 
ed States, in Hawaii, or anywhere 
else, to accept this congressional 
action which is intended to safe- 
guard the best interests of the 
two peoples." 

F*resident Quezoa and Vice Pres- 
ident Osmena and the members of 
the War Cabinet left Manila on 
December 24, 1941, to go to Cor- 
regidor, where the second inaugu- 
ration took place on December 30. 
On Corregidor, Osmena was in 
charge of the destruction of the 
Philippine paper currency for the 
Philippine Government, and super- 
intended the loading of the Phil- 
ippine gold reserv’e on the subma- 
rine which brought it to the United 
States. On February 20, 1942, 
Osmena left Corregidor with Fhres- 
ident Quezon, and shared in the 
hazardous journey, first to Cebu, 
thence to Mindanao and Australia, 
and finally to the United States. 

Since his arrival in Washington, 
Osmena has caried a large share 
of the duties of the Philippine 
Ck)vemment-in-exile. In the ab- 
sence of the President, he attended 
the meetings of th Pacific War 
Council. On September 9, 1943, 
he signed the draft agreement of 
the United Nations Relief and Re- 
habilitation Administration on be- 
half of the Philippines at the 
White House: on September 15, 
1943, he was appointed Chairman 
of the Post-War Planning Board 
of the Philippine Government; and 
on July 14, 1944, he was apjiointed 
Chairman of the Filipino repre- 
sentatives of the Filipino Reha- 
bilitation Commission, which was 
created by an act of the Congress 
of the United States to plan for 
the relief, rehabilitation and re- 
construction of the Philippines and 
future trade relations bet\veen the 
United States and the Philippines, 
which will so largely determine the 
economic future of the islands. 

Guiding the Philippines through 
the next few crucial years is not 
an easy task. It is the good for- 
tune of the people of the Philip- 
pines that that task is in the 
hands of the man who guided them 
through the equally crucial years 
when they were just starting on 
the road to self-government and in 
independence — Sergio Osmena. 



take his family to the movies once 
a month, have a chicken dinner 
once a monht in addition to the 
usual casualty at the cockpit, buy 
inexpensive but decent clothes for 
his family — in other words, do 
some of the things that civilized 
people in 1935 do as a matter of 
course. 

General Prosperity 

“I do not know how much Mr. 
Villamin expects the benefit-shar- 
ers to receive annually. Neither 
do I know how he arrived at the 
apparently reasonable sum in 
round figures of 50,000,000 pesos. 

"But I know that if that amount 
is distributed at the ‘rate of 10 
pesos a month to wage-earners, 
416,666 of them will be benefitted. 
And taking every wage-earner to 
be the main support of five per- 
sons, a very conservative estimate 
in the Philippines, more than 
2,000, (X)0 men, women and children 
— one-sixth of the entire popula- 
tion — will be direct sharers of the 
benefits resulting from the rela- 
tions between the Philippines and 
the United States. 

"And that is not taking into con- 
sideration what Economist Villa- 
min figures out as the resultant 
greater volume and velocity to 
the money circulation and more 
substantial taxes to the govern- 
ment. Plainly speaking, Villamin’s 
share-the-benefits program will 
benefit the whole country, includ- 
ing the underpaid government em- 
ployees and schoolteachers who 
are having a heck of a time trying 
to maintain a standard of living 
compatible with the dignity of 
their positions. 

Ver>’ Little Action 

"From the little - man - loving 
Governor-General (Hon. Frank 
Murphy, now justice of the U. S. 
Supreme Court) to the two-for-a- 
nickle economists has come a lot 
of talk of ‘social justice’ in general 
terms. Talk is necessary, but so 
far we have seen very little action. 
And meantime the situation of the 
small wage-earner is growing 
worse. To him Sakdalism looks 
more enticing than ever, and Be- 
nigno Ramos and his lieutenants 
appear more sympathetic, more 
humanitarian, friendlier €uid great- 
er than the great men of the Phil- 
ippines. (Note: Correspondent 

Wingo wrote this sirtlcle one week 
before the Sakdal uprisings of 
May 3.) 

Progressive Program 

"A smashing blow for social jus- 
tice on the conck of Sakdalism is 
Villamin’s share-the-benefits pro- 
gram: 

"(1) Increase import tariff only 
for actual reciprocal concessions 
and keep down the cost of living. 

"(2) Increase by 509^ the wages 
of cigar-makers through the main- 
tenance of rational prices in Amer- 
ica by Philippine manufacturers. 

"(3) 'Turn at least half of the 
coconut oil excise tax collections 
over to copra producers. (These 
colections averaged 40,000,000 pe- 
sos a year.) 

"(4) Declare hemp a ‘basic agri- 
cultural commodity’ and pay proc- 
essing tax collections to planters. 
(These colections would amount to 
approximately 20,(X)0,000 pesos a 
year.) 

"(5) Continue sugar benefit pay- 
ments to planters, minus a rea- 
sonable amount for agricultural 
experiments and diversification of 
crops, for planters make a sacrifice 
every year they reduce their acre- 
age. (’These benefit payments 
would aggregate about 30,000,000 
a year.) 

IVingo Editorializes 

"As a Washington correspond- 
ent, there is no job more odious to 
me than to editorialize. But hav- 
ing a heart that beats for my suf- 
fering fellowmen, it is hard for 
me to stand by and merely report 
and interpret facts . . . The Philip- 
pines’ little man still stands on the 
sidelines as comparatively ignor- 
ant, undernourished and bereft of 
the benefits of civilization. 

"A lot of trouble in the future 
may be prevented by an applica- 
tion of even only the rudiments of 
social justice to the little man 
right now. Learn from the grim 
experiences of sister nations like 
Ckiba and Mexico. The masses 
there were very ignorant indeed, 
but not too ignorant to pull the 
trigger of a gun. 

"Of what use are all these bene- 
fits accruing from our relations 
with the U. S. if the little man 
does not get his full share? Of 
what use is the campaign for an 
Intimate economic relationship 
with the U. S. if the little man 
remains forgotten? 

"As heretofore Mr. Villamin will 
continue to work for Philippine 
economic rights and privileges in 
the U. S. He will continue to 
work here for Philippine business 
and industry. But in the Philip- 
pines he expects to continue his 
share-the-benefits campaign for 
the little man. even if he has to 
step on the toes of his own clients * 



and friends. 

‘If his plan works, he will make 
the poor richer and the rich still 

very rich." 

Frontal Attack 

Thus far 'the clear and thought- 
provoking article of Mr. Wingo, 
who is now with the O.W.I. some- 
where in the Southwest Pacific 
engaged in psychological warfare. 
Before he left Washington, Mr. 
Wingo’s ability was appreciated by 
the late President Quezon, who 
gave him a responsible position 
and considered him as a good tim- 
ber for higher responsibilities in 
the new Philippines. 

The opinions ex^pressed by Mr. 
Wingo on the Villamin Plan are 
worthwhile pondering, for they 
mark him as a man whose heart 
beats for the common man and 
who, like Mr. Villamin, is not 
afraid to give his ideas even if 
they are unpopular with the rich, 
the powerful and the politically 
influential. 

Here in the United Sttaes, in 
this year 1944, Mr. Villamin is en- 
gaged in a frontal attack of the 
basic problem of the Filipino peo-

President Osmena, Described by Late 
Pres. Quezon. A Great Leader Who 
Inaugurates A New P. I. Gov't. 

Ac Malacanang Palace in Manila a magnificent banquet was 
tendered by President and Mrs. Manuel L. Quezon on September 
8, 1938 in honor of the 60th birthday of Vice-President Sergio 
Osmena, who is now the President of the Philippines, following 
the death of President Quezon on August 1, 1944. 

The s|>ecch of President Quezon on that occasion is the best 
eulogy of Mr. Osmena and it is rc-<^ 
printed in full as follows: 

Qtio7.on'8 Speech 

“Wo aro honorlni; tonight my 
friend and colleague, the Vloo- 
Pronldcnt, on the occa<don of the 
GOth anlvcnary of IiIh birthday. I 
am very happy to be able to thu.s 
honor him. 

“The VIce-Preuldcnt Is a bom 
statesman. Ho \va.s hardly 38 years 
old when ho was elected to the 
First National Assembly, and even 
at that time ho proved himself to 
bo the greatest statesman of his 
day. .Sorglo Osmena will go down 
In history ns one of the greatest 
Filipinos. Ho had tho ability to 
interpret to tho American people 
tho Ideals and sentiments of tho 
Filipino people, and to tho Filipino 
people tho purposes and objectives 
of tho United States in the Philip- 
pines. 

“Sergio Osmena came to power 
os the loader of the NatlonaJl.st 
Party, and, therefore, as tho 
spokesman of tho Filipino people 
In their struggle for Independence. 

In his wisdom, he so ably pre- 
8cntc<1 to tho United States those 
natural ambitions of his people 
which, from tho beginning, Ameri- 
cans understood and appreciated; 
and In tho thirst for freedom and 
liberty of tho people of this coun- 
try, there was not Involved any 
antagonism or 111-fcellng toward 
the United States. 

“On tho other hand, he had the 
ability to tell tho Filipino people 
that Americans had come to tho 
Philippines not to exploit or en- 
slave them, but — in good faith — to 
help them attain tho Independence 
for which they had fought. Thus, 
ho became tho man who made it 



Ippincs to work together and to 
accomplish that noble enterprise 
which Ls today the admiration of 
the world and tho source of grati- 
tude to the United States on tho 
part of the Philippines. When his- 
tory Ls written, the main credit 
for this great accomplishment will 
ho given to Sergio Osmena. 

“It happened that the Vice- 
President and I have been friends 
ever since wo were In college. Wc 
entered politics In tho same year. 
Wo were elected provincial gover- 
nors on the same day, and we took 
our oath of office on the same day; 
we wore elected to tho Philippine 
Assembly on tho same day, and 
we took our oath of office on the 
same day. Ho was elected Speak- 
er. the leader of that Assembly; 
and It was my privilege to cooper- 
ate with him. I was his leader on 
the floor, but I must say In frank- 
ness that while then I cooperated 
with Speaker Osmena, it was he 
and he alone who conceived tho 
policies of the party and deter- 
mined how to carry them out. 

“I am afald that tho majority of 
tho young people now living have 
forgotten or have never know^ 
how much the Vlcc-PresIdcnt has 
done for them, and how much of 
tho freedom and advancement they 
enjoy today ore duo to the rislon 
and the unselfish service rendered 
to our common country by this 
man. 

“Sergio Osmena, os Speaker of 
the House In 1907, was practically 
the only man in that body who 
knew’ anything about leglslatlvo 
work, and the wonder of It all was 
he had never been outside of his 
country, that ho had never seen a 



pos.slble for America and the Phil- Icgrlslativo body at w’ork, that per-

haps he had read very little about 
democracy and the workings of 
democracy; and yot none of our 
Assemblies, from the first to the 
last, has ever excelled that First 
Assembly either In the ability of 
its members, In the character of 
the W’ork accomplished, or In the 
patriotic spirit with which it 
served. It w’as all due to Sergio 
Osmena. We were nothing but his 
collaborators. 

“It has been the irony of fate 
that It fell to my lot to have to 
fight his leadership after a long, 
continuous, and deli^tful associa- 
tion. But there had never been on 
my part, nor I think on his part, 
any ill-feeling in any political 
struggle In w’hich we w’ere en- 
gaged. Each did what we thought 
W’as right and his duty. 

“As I look back to the day when 
for tho first time the Vice-Presi- 
dent and I, loving each other as 
much as we did, found ourselves 
In opposite camps, the only expla- 
nation that I can find Is tho fact 
that wo are temperamentally op- 
posite. He is by natture an evolu- 
tionist, and I have been all my life 
a revolntlonlst. He always built 
upon tho past, while I always want 
to Jump. That and that alone was 
the cause of our misunderstand- 
ings. 

“Inspired by a rebellious spirit, 
I always moved in a hurry* — never 
satlsfled; I always wanted to go 
on without looking back; while be, 
ever measuring the distance, al- 
ways looked ahead but without 
forgetting what was behind. It 
was only for this reason that we 
clashed; and so you find that at 
the end of every struggle, sincerely 
there were never fundamentally 
serious differences in our aims and 
purposes, it has always been pos- 
sible for ns to Join hands again. 

“Since I have been elected Presi- 
dent of tho Philippines, 1 have 
had the good fortime of ha\lng 
around me men who are loyal to 
me and who have worked nnself- 
Ishly for the success of my admin- 
istration; but nowhere have I 
found a more loyal and more dis- 
interested collaborator than in my 
old friend, Vice-President Osmena. 

“Mr. Vice President, 1 hope the 
Filipino people will never forget 
how’ much they owe you. As for 
me, nothing that I can do now or 
In the future will ever repay you 
for tho loyal cooperation you have 
given me. 

“Ladles and gentlemen, I want 
you to drink to the health and 
success of one of the greatest men 
that our country has produced — 
the Vice President.” 

Osmena's Noble Reply 

As the last echo of the tremen- 
dous ovation that followed Presi- 
dent Quezon's speech lost itself in 
the spacious halls of Malacanang 
Palace and outside among the lux- 
uriant trees and palms. Vice Presi- 
dent Sergio Osmena arose in his 
place and with a voice that vi- 
brate with an intense emotion said, 
among other things, the following 
noble utterance: 

“Through tho vicissitudes of pol- 
itics. tho man w’ho was my prin- 
cipal supporter, who aided mo so 
greatly In the post, became my 
chief. After this change, I did not 
have the least hesitation In sup- 
porting him, because I recognized 
that the country had pleased him 
in the position of leadership. And 
I wish to say to you that I have 
never been happier than In the 
daj’s when I have followed the 
leadership of President Quezon. 

“And, as he had been most loyal 
to me In the past and had given 
me his nnconditlonal support, — In 
reality he made possible my career 
In the Assembly of Governors and 
later In the Philippine Assembly — 
I believe It was my duty to follow 
him when he assumed leadership 
of the government, no matter If I

Should Jap Emperor Be Liquidated?! Vacationing 

By Vincente Villamin j 

(Filipino Lawyer and Eoconomist) 

As the road to Tokyo daily gets shorter, rw'o questions are 
already dividing American public opinion: (a) Should the 
Japanese Emperor be saved from physical harm during the war? 

(b) If he survived after Japan’s defeat, should he be retained 
as the head of the Japanese people? 

It will be recalled that the Doolittle bombing expedition 

to Tokyo In the Spring of 1942 had^"^

instructions not to drop bombs on 
the Imperial Palace so as not to 
endanger the ETmperor’s life. Ob- 
viously the American government 
wanted to save him for some use- 
ful purpose. 

The respect for the person of tho 
Emperor is grounded in the belief 
that he incarnates if feebly at 
present the force in Japanese life 
that represents the things that the 
militarists and fanatics do not, and 
that therefore he should be pre- 
served as he would or could be the 
best element for the United Na- 
tions to deal with after the war. 

Those who hold the contrary 
view allege that the liquidation of 
the Emperor would cleanse Japan- 
ese life of the poison that muddles 
the mind and differentiates the 
Japanese from the rest of man- 
kind, besides removing the con- 
venient vehicle for tho carrying 
out of the ideas of the militarists 
and fanatics who happen to be in 
power. • 

The pro-E^mperor school of 
thought, giving it a name that 
doesn't mean that it favors him, 
recognizes that it is the people in. 
Japan who know their enlight- 
ened self-interest that should be 
encouraged, for their rise would 
bring about the fall of the anti- 
democratic, anti-rational and anti- 
foreign influences in that country. 
The Emperor, institutionally 
stable, spiritually potent and per- 
sonally the richest Japanese, is 
believed to be really on the side of 
the democratic elements in the 
nation. That he followed the dic- 
tates of the militarists and fana- 
tics in the present war is but a 
proof of the weakness of the demo- 
cratic elements which is reflected 
in his own weakness. 

The anti-E}mperor school of 
thought counter by saying that It 
is always dangerous to concen- 
trate power in one entity, for it 
can be readily used, as history 
amply proves, by the power behind 
the throne. They prefer, as every- 
one does, to see the power lodged 
In the group that depends for its 
existence on the wisdom of its 
plans for the entire nation. 

The point in this argument is 
blunted by the fact that it is pre- 
cisely the intention to make the 
Emperor responsive primarily, 
under a clear constitutional pro- 
vision confirmed by an imperial 
rescript, to the people’s represent- 
atives in the new scheme of gov- 
ernment where, as here in the 
United States, the military is sub- 
ordinate to the civil. However, 
the Japanese people would need a 
thorough indoctrination in this 
principle if it is to prevail, al- 
though the Emperor’s leadership 
in that connection would give it 
immediate acceptance. 

The question of the future role 
of the Emperor in Japanese life is 
of vital interest to the United 
Nations because if the present 
system is to continue the next war 
would only be a matter of time. 
When Germany capitulated in

W’ere not in agreement with him in 
some of his plans or Ideas. As a 
good soldier I followed and sup- 
ported him; and I do not hesitate 
to say tonight that, as tho Presi- 
dent upheld me when I was the 
leader of the country and Just os 
he had the courage to fight side 
by side with me and to face all 
kinds of responsibilities, so when 
the Senate had been organized and 
he became our leader, I w'as like- 
wise disposed to appear before 
history as his follower, believing 
in his leadership and willing to 
share his defeats as w’ell as his 
triumphs. 

“. . . I believe that my duty to 
bo loyal Is greater than ever. My 
regret is that I can not do more 
because of my limitations. But 
the President knows that In the 
present situation when he is un- 
dertaking the gigantic task of na- 
tional reconstruction and of pre- 
paring the country for independ- 
ence, he know’s, I repeat, that I am 
at his disposal at any time, and 
that neither the place nor tho as- 
signment matters. 

“My loyalt>’ to him is not merely’ 
personal, arising from old friend- 
ship and comradeship which began 
In our student daj’s and which has 
been maintained throughout tho 
\icissltudes of our public career; 
it Is based also on my faith in his 
leadership, on my firm conviction 
that under the present circum- 
stances the duty of everyone who 
desires to contribute to the up- 
building of our nation Is to cooper- 
ate firmly and resolutely with the 
present administration and thus 
I assure its success.” 



World War I its Emperor fled to 
a foreign country. A government 
with democratic leanings was es- 
tablished and the militarists w’ent 
into eclipse for a time. Then 
came National Socialism and even- 
tually the present war. The situ- 
ation in Japan after its capitula- 
tion is likely to be different. The 
Emperor w’ould remain, together 
with the status quo. As he is their 
God, tho Japanese would rally 
around him instead of expel him 
in time of sorrow and humiliation. 
He will be a royal war prisoner 
subject to the dispositions of the 
victorious nations. 

After Japan’s defeat the mili- 
tarists will either have been killed 
or have committed suicide. The 
surviving militarists and fanatics 
will have been placed under con- 
trol, with their philosophies dis- 
credited. A situation will exist 
where the democratic elements 
will be dominant. It is expected 
that with the liberated Emperor, 
they will work out a new system 
of government making democratic 
principles and controls decisive. 
Without the Emperor's unifying 
influence, it is believed that the 
democratization of Japan would 
be fraught with the dangers that 
overtook the democratic regime 
in Germany after World War I 
and brought forth the fanatical 
Nazis. 

The anti-Emperor school might 
emphasize the point that the liqui- 
dation of the Emperor is more im- 
portant as a means of ending the 
war with Japanese defeat than his 
survival would be for postwar pur- 
poses. His disappearance might 
conceivably cause such disturb- 
ance in the Japanese mind that it 
might greatly weaken the morale 
of the whole people. They might 
even go berserk, commit mass 
harl-klri and confound themselves. 
At the same time, another phase 
of the Japanese character might 
burst forth with relentless fury, 
retaliating with an inhuman 
fierceness, and beginning the proc- 
ess by murdering the war prison- 
ers and civilian internees. 

The Emperor is both the head of 
the nation and the God of the 
people. He is more than the "De- 
fender of the Faith” that the 
British King is and has more 
spiritual influence on the Japanese 
than the Pope has on the Catho- 
lics. If he were merely the na- 
tion’s head he would come under 
the general rule that in time of 
war everyone belonging to a bel- 
ligerent nation, including its high- 
est authority, is subject to appre- 
hension and slaughter by the en- 
emy. To the American soldier, 
God or not, — he doesn’t know — the 
Emperor, like the Nazi Fuehrer, is 
his foe and he would finish him 
if he had a chance and not other- 
wise ordered. On the other hand, 
the Japanese soldier will not hesi-

In order to maintain the conti- 
nuity of the government a few 
hours after the death of President 
Manuel L. Quezon the Hon. Sergio 
Osmena was sworn in as President 
of the Philippines by Associate 
Justice Robert Jackson of the U. S. 
Supreme Clburt, 

The ceremony took place at the 
Department of the Interior in the 
presence of Secretary of the In- 
Iterior Harold Ickes, Miss Maria 
Osmena, the President’s daughter, 
and officials of the American and 
Philippine governments. 

President Osmena’s first utter- 
ance after assuming his new of- 
fice follows: 

"I am conscious of the tremen- 
dous responsibility that is mine 
as I assume the Preidency of the 
Philippines. I pledge all that is 
in me to ser\’e the best interests of 
the Filipino people- My first ob- 
jective is to cooperate with the 
American Government, sparing 
nothing, for the achievement of 
victory which means the complete 
liberation of the Philippines. Phil- 
ippine relief and rehabilitation is 
one of our pressing problems. 

”I have faith in America and in 
the American people, and as in the 
past, I know the United States 
will keep faith with us. The free- 
dom of the Filipino people is my 
goal and the permanence of that 
independence once achieved I will 
strive to secure.” 

(Editor’s note: For the purpose 
of the record. Mr. Quezon died at 
10:(6 A.M., Tuesday. August 1, 
1944 and Mr. Osmena succeeded 
him as President at 2:4b PJ^I. on 
the same day.) 



tate to send the American Presi- 
dent to eternity under similar cir- 
cumstances. To the fighting man 
the liquidation of the heads of bel- 
ligerent governments who arc 
their respective commanders-in- 
chlef is but an incident, momen- 
tous to bo sure, in war operations. 

But when peace is restored and 
the Emperor has sunived, his re- 
moval from power to destroy the 
religion of which he is the God 
and Deity would be a task that 
democratic nations would hardly 
think of undertaking, for suppress- 
ing a religion, however incompre- 
hensible it may be, would violate 
the foundational principles of de- 
mocracy. To the outside world 
Shintoism and Emperor Worship 
may be nothing but a clap-trap 
invented 77 years ago to promote 
national solidity, blind obedience 
and fanatic patriotism, but to the 
Japanese it is actually a deep- 
seated feeling that influences him 
more profoundly than a devout 
non-Japanese Is s\vayed by his 
religion. 

The non-liquldatlon of the Jap- 
anese E^mperor and the redefini- 
tion of his functions can only have 
one purpose, and that is to use 
him in discarding the philosophy 
that makes for inevitable war and 
in creating a democratic society 
and government in Japan with 
peace as its ideal and with him as 
the rallying point. Such inten- 
tion, told to the Japanese in the 
home and fighting fronts, given 
powerful emphasis by the Army 
and Navy persuaders, might lead 
them to see the light at last and 
give up in unconditional surrender 
for the good of their people and all.

Miss M. Osmena 
Is First Lady 

The assumption of the office of 
President of the Philippines on 
August 1 by Hon. Sergio Osmena 
saw his daughter, Miss Maria Pa- 
loraar Osmena, become the official 
hostess of the President, the First 
Lady of the Philippines in Wash- 
ington. Mrs. Osmena is in Manila. 

Miss Osmena has all the quaifi- 
cations — and more — for a worthy, 
helpful and inspiring First Lady. 
She has a good and penetrating 
mind, beauty and charm, social 
graces and fine appearance, intelli- 
gence and culture, and sincerity 
and frankness. She is a Filipina, 
par excellence. 

She speaks English. Spanish and 
Italian. She was educated in the 
best schools in the Philippines and 
in Italy, where she took voice les- 
sons. She has travelled widely in 
Europie and in the United States. 
Her circle of acquaintances is wide 
and comprises distinguished men 
and women of many nations. 

Miss Osmena knows America, 
the American language and slang- 
uage, the American ideals and 
methods as well as the American 
dream. She admires the Ameri- 
can pieople, their freedom, culture, 
friendliness, generosity and their 
high standard of living. 

The many and heavy duties that 
will fall on her father w’ill find in 
her a sympathetic and efficient 
collaborator. She can be exp)ected 
to live a life of dignity but not of 
extravagance. Being an extraor- 
dinarily sensible person, she wiU 
not waste time in purely social 
matters during the war but will be 
an exempaur of sober and serious 
work in line with the efforts of her 
father as the War President of the 
Philipjpines. 

EX’ery Filipino in America, man 
and woman, is proud of Miss Os- 
mena and bespeaks for her a suc- 
cessful role a the First Lady of the 
Philippines in the United States.

they are wicked speculations, is to

Why I Am Running For President 



By Casimero I. Abella 

For many years 1 have never wanted to run for any office 

in our Union in spite of the insistent requests of many friends 

^ o are members of our Organization. I have devoted my time 

in helping the election of those who have been and are still 

in power, thinking that they will conduct our Union to the 

promotion of the interests and welfare of our fellow workers. 
But now affairs and the admin-^ — 

istration of our Union are tuminEk ,, k

REFORM PARTY DEMANDS T. A. 

ROJO RUN FOR RE-ELECTION 



as officers of the Union. 

Failures of Present Administration 

1. Failure of the blacklisted 
members to go back to their jobs 
because their cases were not pro- 
perly attended to. 

2. Failure of the administration ' 
to adopt a sound policy for recruit- 
ing cannery workers for Alaska. 

3. Failure of the president to 
submit resignation of officers and 
appointment of employees to work ' 
for the Union to the Elxecutive 
Council. 

Mj' Qualifications 

I have always been active in the 
labor movement. I was one of the 
pioneer organizers of our present 
Local 7, UCAPAWA. Aly labor re- 
cord speaks for itself: 

1934 — Joined the C.W. & F.L, 
Union 18257. A.F.L., and became 
chairman and leader of the suc- 
cessful strike in the valley be- 
tween Seattle and Tacoma. 

1935— Officers of the C.W. & 
F.L. 18257, A.F.L., split themselves 
and caused the creation of the 
Protective Association, a labor un- 
ion which became a strong conten- 
der of the C.W. & F.L. 18257 in 
the Canning Industry. 

I was taken to the Protective 
Association as a member of the 
Council. When the president of 
the Protective Association resign- 
ed. during the hardest time in the 
cannery labor movement, I was 
elected president when nobody had 
the guts to shoulder the respon- 
sibility. 

1936 — Succeeded in bringing the 
Protective Association back to the 
C.W. & F.L. 18257. First time in 
the history of the cannery workers 
in Alaska to be dispatched and 
employed in the Canning Salmon 
Industry in the name of one Union 
C.W. & F.L. Union. 

In the general election of 1936, 
I was elected vice-president, and 



1937 administration. 

1937- My administration fought 
to the limit the Contractor Sys- 
tem in the Canning Salmon Indus- 
tr>' and succeeded in eliminating 



\ ‘ 




fore, with an annual income of 
$60,000.00. It has bought with cash, 
a three story building. 

In 1942, T. A. Rojo was Secre- 
tary of the Union, succeeding his 
friend, I. I. Josue. In that year 
the members, by a landslide vote 
of over two to one, again gave him 
the presidency of UCAPAWA Lo-

Japanese and Filipino contractors. 

1938 — Declined to accept my 
nomination for any major office 
because I wanted to go to Alaska 
for a rest, as you all knew that I 
overworked myself patrolling at 
night for the officers of the Union 
would not let me go away, feel- 
ing that they might not be able 
to control the Union against 
stooges who were at that time busy 
trying to wreck the Union. 

I was forced to accept the trea- 
surership and served for two suc- 
cessive terms. This was the troubl- 
ed year of the Consent Election. 
And it was for Collective Bargain- 
ing Agency in the Canned Scd- 
mon Industry. 

It was a most trying period in 
our history as an organized labor 
union, and I was even jailed when 
I was leading the sound truck 
around contractor dlNtrlct c a m- 
paigning for cannery workers to 
vote for Local 7. UCAPAWA, CIO. 
The officers of the American Fed- 
eration of Labor were responsible 
for putting me in jail in order to 
weaken the morale of our mem- 
bers and vote for their Union. 
But I did not stay in jail long 
and came out in time for the Con- 
sent Election. We succeeded in 
winning the Collective Bargaining 
.-Vgency for cannery workers in 
the Canned Salmon Industry. 

1939 — WTien the biggest trouble 
of our Union was settled in favor 
of our side, I resigned as treasurer 
before the e.\piration of my term 
to work in Alaska up to 1943. 

So friends and fellow members, 
this is the true history of our

of our struggle for recognition as 
working men aspiring for the same

$25.00 a day or more. 

Solved Shortage 
“In view of the colossal global 
crisis and the fact that the U. S. 
government industries themselves 
are short of thousands of men, our 
shortage is phenomenally small. 
We have overcome it by making 
arrangements for the transporta- 
tion of our members by planes 
from the Bristol Bay Canneries 
which operated and closed early, 
to the salmon canneries in South 
Alaska, where the season is late.” 

V^eteran Labor Leader 
T. A. Rojo was President of the 
Union in 1939-1940, Trustee of the 
Maritime Federation of the Paci- 
fic in 1940-1941. Before he became 
president of the Union, during dis- 
patching days, there was disorder 
almost every day and the Union 
treasury was in the red to the 
tune of $10,000.00. His 1940-1941 
administration handed to his suc- 
cessor $13,000.00. Before T. A. Ro- 
jo entered the picure, the Union 
lights and telephone were frequent- 
ly cut off due to unpaid bills and 
the Union had to pay $903.52 fine 
for neglected taxes. This was when 
his opponent. C. Abella was treas- 
urer. Now the Union is more pow- 
erful and prosperous than ever be- 



TRINIDAD A. ROJO 

cal 7. Last year he was re-elected 
with a vote of almost three to one. 

T. A. Rojo is a member of the 
War Labor Board pannel of the 
Twelfth Regional District and is 
the Vice President of the Seattle 
CIO Council. California leaders, 
who attended the Filipino National 
Convention held in Sacramento, 
remember T. A. Rojo as the tech- 
nical adviser of the late Francisco 
Varona in 1938. 

President Rojo was one of the 
drafters of the present constitution 
of UCAPAWA Local 7 and is pre- 
paring the new constitution of the 
Coastwise Local 7 which has 
branches in Portland, Stockton and 
San Francisco. 

With such a record, it is no sur- 
P|ise that Donald Henderson, elo^ 
quent and scholarly General Pre- 
sident of the United Canneries 
Agricultural, Packing and Allied 
Workers of America, paid T. A. 
Rojo a glowing tribute as a labor 
leader in one of his letters, and in 
a speech delivered at a labor con- 
ference held in Los Angeles, in 
February of this year. 

For the Union, T. A. Rojo has 
shelved his researches, studies and 
books. If the Union membership 
did not draft him for labor work, 
he would have taken a Ph. D. De- 
gree several years ago; for he had 
finished all credits required, ex- 
cept the thesis, for that high 
scholastic attainment. He is a 
member of the Alpha Kappa Delta, 
American National honorary in 
Sociology, He is a holder of A. B. 
in comparative literature and M. 
A. in English and drama. He is the 
author of a booklet, entitled, Phil- 
ippine Language Problem, some 
dramas, and numerous articles 
published in newspapers and ma- 
gazines, such as Philippine FYeo 
Press, Manila Graphic, El Comer- 
clo, Osias’ Filipino Fomm, Philip- 
pine Social Science Review, Mid- 
Pacific Magazine, Sociology and 
Social Re.search, etc. 

Sacrificed Profession 
Since he became a labor lead- 
er, President Rojo is too. busy to 
write any work that measures up 
to the productions of his pen be- 
fore 1939. In 1937, for instance, the 
late President Quezon was so im- 
pressed with T. A. Rojo's booklet 
on language, that he and Profes- 
sor De Veyra sent a radiogram to 
publisher E. L. Rosario, asking 
permission to reprint the work in 
Manila for popular distribution. In 
his scholarly book, entitled, The 
Philippines, Joseph Ralston Hay- 
den, formerly Vice-Governor Gen- 
eral of the Philipines, quotes Rojo’s 
booklet extensively on page 593. 
Men of culture who know T. A. 
Rojo, morn the fact that he has 
sacrificed scholarship and liter- 
ature for labor and they regret 
to notice that his style, written 
and spoken, is inferior to his style 
before ho became a Union Presi- 
dent. Several times he wanted 
to go back to his studies and re- 
searches but again and again the 
overwhelming majority of his mem- 
bers demanded that he remain to 
pilot the Union in the troubled wa- 
ters of the unusual emergency we 
are in. 

Officially he wants to win in the 
next general election of UCAPA- 
WA Local 7, but privately he longs 
to go back to scholarship and lit- 
erature.

(Continued from page 1) 
reported in the press: 

‘A 19-gun salute boomed out in 
Quezon’s honor after a procession 
to the cemetery with Army, Navy 
and Marine escorts from St. 
Mathews Cathedral, where the 
Most Reverend John M. McNa- 
mara, auxiliary Bishop of Wash- 
ington and Baltimore, was cele- 
brant at a requiem mass. 

“In attendance were Admiral 
Ernest J. King and General George 
C. Marshall representing Presi- 
dent Roosevelt, and Sergio Osme- 
na, Quezon’s successor as Presi- 
dent of the exiled Philippine gov- 
ernment. 

“The body was placed in a mau- 
soleum. It will be returned to the 
Philippines after the islands’ liber- 
ation.” 

Quezon’s Death 

TIME gives a graphic picture of 
the passing away of President 
Quezon in the following words: 

“Manuel Quezon, 65, first Presi- 
dent of the Philippine Common- 
wealth, lay in a log house at Sara- 
nac Lake, N. Y. He was listen- 
ing, his physician was reading 
aloud from the Sermon on the 
Mount. Tuberculosis had almost 
conquered his fighting-bantam lit- 
tle body. But he did not believe he 
could die when the sun was shin- 
ing, and now it was bright morn- 
ing. After a while he aske^ that 
the radio be turned on. 'The news: 
U. S. troops had landed at Sansa- 
por, Dutch New Guinea. Manuel 
Quezon, who had dreamed of re- 
entering Manila with Gen. Mac- 
Arthur, exclaimed: ‘Just 6(X) 

miles!’ 'Then he coughed spas- 
modically. A hemorrhage began. 
When his wife came, summoned 
from Mass, he waved her away to 
spare her the sight of his suffer- 
ing. He was unconscious in a few 
minutes. In a few more, his drag- 
ging breathing stopped.” 

The FUneral 

“Then Manuel Quezon’s funeral 
procession began, to the throb of 
muffled drums, the cadenced music 
of a military band. 'The casket 
was borne on a black-wheeled ar- 
tillery caisson drawn by six white 
horses. Behind it marched mourn- 
ers and battalions from the Army, 
Navy and Marine Ckirps. The pro- 
cession wound its way to the high- 
est hill in Arlington National Cem- 
etery, not far from the Tomb of 
the Unknown Soldier, to a tomb 
beneath the grey steel mast of the 
U. S. MAINE. ’There, to the 
measured boom of a 19-gun salute 
and the long, sweet notes of ‘Taps,’ 
Manuel Quezon was laid to rest.” 

In his tribute to Pres. Quezon, 
his successor, Mr. Osmena, put in 
one simple sentence the beauty of 
their friendship, saying: “Our 

friendship stood the test of all po- 
litical differences.” 

It would take volumes to report 
here the tribute of love, affection 
and admiration which both tho 
American and Filipino people paid 
to the “George Washington of the 
Filipinos.”

Bv MISS SPOTTER 

My publUhcr received hundreds 

of inquiries from our readers why 
this column was missing in last 
month's issue. Well folks, I am 
sorry it was all my fault but 1 
had to take a month's lay*off. My 
boy friend whom I have not seen 
for two long years arrived from 
overseas duty from the Southwest 
Pacific and we simply wanted to 
bo together every minute of his 
30-day furlough. You can’t blame 
me, won’t you? Lately, he report- 
ed back for duty and I am free 
again, but gee whiz my mind is 
still focused on him. During those 
days (30 days to be exact) is like 
a dream, so short to him but still 
shorter to me. He is gone — where ? 
no body knows. 

In spite of being not in my 
former self, I will manage some 
how to fill up my column with hot 
stuff, roses and thorns.

Do you know Frank Lopez? He

by his parents and godparents on

Dancing was indulged in by

HIS CAMPAIGN TOUR 



PAGE NINE 



Appointed 



Leaving Los Angeles last Mon- 
day morning, August 14, and away 
for over a week, until he came 
back to his office on August 22, 
Francisco A. Lopez, candidate for 

the office of president of the In- 
ter-Filipino Communities of the 
Western States — Arizona, Califor- 
nia, Oregon and Washington — has 
campaigned in Northern California 
touching the cities of Oxnard. Ven- 
tura, Santa Marla, Guadalupe. San 
Luis Obispo, Salinas, San Jose, San 
Francisco, Oakland, Alameda, Val- 
lejo, Sacramento, Stockton, Mer- 
ced, Madera, Fresno, Delano, and 
Bakersfield, and then back to his 
general headquarters in Los An- 
geles. 

He is preparing for the general 
election and meeting with the 
delgates of Filipino communities 
there and whom he will meet in 
the convention to be held in Fresno 
on August 11 to 14. At which 
time, election will take place. 

In Stockton, he has met with 
some of the candidates aspiring for 
the same office. To them he ex- 
pressed openly his views: "That 

he was only offering his services 
to the fellowmen and their com- 
munities.” 

"I hate to promise anything to 
any one at election time for fear of 
being misunderstood. Besides, 
promises are very cheap, and poli- 
ticians have misused promises 
most of the time. I am not a 
politician. I am a newspaperman 
and I speak directly and squarely 
to any individual. 

"Before we can solve our own 
problems as Filipinos, before we 
have the right to talk representa- 
tions of our communities, it is 
important that we Filipinos must 
FIRST UNDERSTAND EACH

To The Front 

Villamor Says 

SALINA, KAN.— The fighting 
front in the Pacific rather than 
the political and talking front in 
Washington is the preference said 
to have been expressed by Major 
Jesus Villamor, distinguished Fili- 
pino ace, who is training here for 
further flying activities in the 
war. The Major while in Wash- 
ington some months ago, did some 
plain talking which some politic- 
ians and Fascist-minded Filipinos 
did not like.

Villamin Advises 
On Jap Attack 

In a widely published and com- 
mented article. Attorney Vicente 
Villamin stated that a psychologi- 
cal attack on Japan to weaken 
the Japanese will to fight and to 
induce them to give up should let 
the Japs know that the Emperor 
will be saved from harm, that 
Japan would be spared from all 
out bombing and that starvation 
would be prevented immediately 
after the war. The Villamin state- 
ment was inspired by the declara- 
tion of Admiral Nimitz, which is 
intended to influence the Japanese, 
that it may not be necessary to 
invade Japan proper.

THE PHILIPPINES MAIL, SALINAS. CALIFORNIA 




Lt. Gov. Houser, 
Filipino Friend 

The Lieutenant Governor of 
California, Hon. Frederick Houser, 
is running for U. S. Senator. 

Gov. Houser is friendly and sym- 
pathetic to Filipinos and is ready 
to help them in all legitimate ef- 
forts to protect their rights and to 
shield them from discriminations. 
He is next to Governor Earl War- 
ren in the State administration. 
He presides over the State Senate. 
Working closely with him is the 
Speaker of the State House. 

Filipinos have in Gov. Houser a 
sincere and powerful friend. He 
has known them as good farm 
workers, good produce growers, 
good students and good fighters. 
He has never had the habit of 
judging Filipinos by the few who 
made mistakes or commit repre- 
hensible acts. He knows humati 
beings and their shortcomings and 
frailties. He is a reeisonable as 
well as a wise and practical man 

Gov. Houser is a graduate in 
law at Harvard University. He is 
in his early forties. Americans of 
all parties and of all conditions of 
life consider him as an American 
who should be invested with high 
government responsibilities for he 
is eminently fitted for them and 
temperamentally and intellectually 
qualified to a high degree. 

With the war in its apogee and 
the tremendous peacetime prob- 
lems in the offing, a man like Gov. 
Houser is needed to help first to 
dissect problems and then to ap- 
ply the remedy. In the U. S. 
Senate, where national and inter- 
national questions are considered 
and decided, is the natural and 
logical place of service for Califor- 
nia’s beloved and respected Fred- 
erick Houser, now Lt. Governor. 



Movie Executives 
Reconsidering 
Filipinos 

HOLLYW(X)D, Cal. — Movie ex- 
ecutives have renewed their inter- 
est in developing Filipino talents 
for both major and minor roles in 
pictures. They expressed interest 
in the matter a couple of months 
ago, but certain events led them to 
put it off. Now it is accepted as a 
certainty that the Philippines is 
going to be before the public when 
the reconquering operations by 
Gen. MacArthur and Admiral 
Nimitz get started. The action is 
expected to last many months be- 
cause of the size of the islands and 
for the reason that Mindanao at 
least will be made the base for 
the heavy attacks and expeditions 
to Japan proper. 

Pictures with Phiippine locale, 
personalities, views and stories are 
therefore in order. 



B-29 Drops Bombs 
IN Mindono 



American B-29 super-fortresses, 
the most powerful plane in the 
world, has dropped bombs on the 
Japanese installations in and 
around Davao in Mindanao. 'The 
event is tantamount to the an- 
nouncement to the Filipino people 
that the “Yanks are coming back” 
to wrest their country from the 
clutches of the Japanese invaders. 

Filipino guerillas received much 
encouragement and their number 
will multiply. The days of the 
Japs are numbered. 



Manila 'Open City' 
Filipinos' Plea 

Filipinos are reported asking the 
Philippine puppet government to 
convince the Jap military author- 
ities to announce even now that 
in the event of a counter-attack 
by Gen. MacArthur the city of 
Manila should be declared an 
“open city.” That means that all 
military men, materials and resist- 
ance wil be removed from the city 
and it will be taken out of the field 
of warlike operations. 

In other words, Manila will not 
be a battlefield and saved from 
destruction. 



Jap Propaganda 
Less Cocky Now 

Now that they are on the de- 
fensive and are being driven back 
every day and mowed dowm by 
the thousands, the Japanese radio 
propaganda emanating from Radio 
Tokyo is less cocksure, less in- 
solent and less insulting. 'The Jap 
idea seems to be to get the sym- 
pathy of the American people and 
to sell them the idea that they 
were driven to go to war against 
the United States government. 

It is the opinion of The MAIL 
editors that the Japs can’t sell 
any bill of goods to the U. S. be- 
fore they are thoroughly licked, 
humbled and put in their place. 



Chairman 




Mr. F. S. 'Maratas, well known 
leader was appointed chairman 
of the delegates to represent the 
Filipino Community of Salinas 
Valley at the 6th Annual Con- 
vention of the FICOWS which 
will be held In Fresno. Mr. Mar- 
atas is the vice president of the 
community.

WE WELCOME FILIPINO PATRONAGE 



The Japs have discovered that a 
secret radio station has been func- 
tioning on the island of Mindoro, 
home province of Executive Editor, 
Manuel M. Insig^^e of this paper, 
not far from the entrance to Man- 
ila Bay. The station has been send- 
ing messages and reports to Uni- 
ted Nations headquarters in Aus- 
tralia on what’s going on in Man- 
ila and the rest of the Philippines. 

’The one in charge of the station 
was Charles “Chick” Parsons, for- 
merly a well-k n o w n American 
businessman in Manila, who has 
been cooperating with General 
Douglas MacArthur since the war 
began. He has been doing excellent 
and patriotic work, facing every- 
day the danger of being discovered 
by the Japs and killed. 

Parsons, it is believed, establish- 
ed a system of reporting with 
various points in the Philippines to 
give general and specific informa- 
tion of the goings-on in the coun- 
try as well as of the different per- 
sonalities in the puppet govern- 
ment. 

When everything is said and 
done, Chick Parson will come out 
after the war as one of the real 
heroes of the Philippines whose 
services proved invaluable in the 
reconquest of the country by Gen. 
MacArthur and Admiral Nimitz 
and their gallant officers and men. 



Dear Fellows of the First Filipi 

As I write this letter I am lost^ 
in a world of memories ... of 
happy days gone by. At the mom- 
ent I re-live those days again, and 
somehow, I feel quite close to you. 

I can picture myself now gabfest- 
ing and laughing with you all un- 
derneath the swaying palm trees 
with its rustling palm leaves flut- 
tering excitedly as the ocean 
breezes playfully touch them. For 
the moment we forget the danger- 
ous task ahead, the task of preser- 
ving a free world through a great 
sacrifice of blood, sweat, and tears. 
For now, I am here to bring you 
the message of millions of women 
the world over who are waiting 
for the day when Peace is ours 
once more and when all of us are 
re-united with loved ones, rela- 
tives, and dear friends. 

This may all sound very senti- 
mental and all mush to some of 
you, but who isn’t sentimental 
sometimes in his life? No matter 
how hard a person may appear, 
there’s always a soft spot some- 
where in his heart. I have a firm 
belief in that, so no contradiction, 
please! 

Now fellows, gather around and 
listen to . . . 

“I’LL WALK ALONE” 

Verse; 

They call, no date. 

I promised you I’d wait. 

I want them all to know I’m 
strictly single-o. 

Chorus: 

I’LL WALK ALONE ... be- 
cause to tell you the truth 
I’ll be lonely . . . 

I don’t mind being lonely . . . 

When my heart tells me you are 
lonely too. 

I’LL WALK ALONE . . . they’ll 
ask me why and I’ll tell them 
I’d rather: . . . 

'There are dreams I must gath- 
er .. . 

Dreams we fashioned the night 
you held me tight. 

I’ll always be near you, 
wherever you are, 

Each night in every prayer. 

If you call I’ll hear you, 
no matter how far; 

Just close your eyes . . . and 
I’ll be there . . . 

Please walk alone . . . and send 
your love and your kisses to 
guide me, . . . 

Till you're walking beside me,. . . 

I’LL WALK ALONE. 

Some of you fellows, who have 
wives or sweethearts left behind, 
go about your duties with heavy 
hearts worrying whether they can 
tEike it if anything should happen 
to you. Of course they can. Elvery- 
one of us realize that we all have 
to make our little sacrifices in this 
world. We are very proud of you 
who are out there fighting. We’re 
all proud of ourselves, tooi for our 
share in the fight, l^ow little it 
may be. Yes, we do dread the 
thought of losing someone we care 
for, but it is God’s will to g^ve 
us Life or to take it away from 




MISS PACITA TODTOD 
us. All we can do is pray for the 
best. But I assure you that the 
women of today can take the hard 
blows in life, even if it tears their 
very hearts out, without a flinch. 
We don’t want to think that you 
are worrying about us, because we 
feel we are soldiers, too, of the 
home front. We’re doing our part; 
we’re waiting and praying for 
your safe return. 

My warm greetings to Colonel 
Offley. I can still remember the 
strains of “My LITTLE GRASS 
SHACK” . . . the song you sing 
so well. 

My fondest greetings to each 
and everyone of you. May God 
keep you and guide you all. 

Affectionately, 

Pacing. 

P. S. — 'There will be a letter de- 
dicated to each different Filipino 
unit or wherever there are Filipino 
soldiers stationed beginning with 
this one. So long ... till next 
time!

CDA Raise $214,150 
War Bonds; Exceeds 
Quota Of $1 00,000 

The War Bond Drive conducted 
by the Caballeros de Dimas Alang 
Inc. for $100,000 with which to buy 
a P-51 Mustang Fighter Plane 
and which wound up with a big 
Bond Rally at the Civic Audi- 
torium in Stockton on July 1, 1941, 
was an overwhelming success. The 
total amount raised was $214,150. 
The Fraternity is now offering 
two P-51 Mustang Fighter Planes 
instead of one. 

The young Filipina women who 
participated in the contest for the 
title of “Spirit of Dimas-Alang,” 
and who were responsible to a 
great extent in the success of the 
Drive, were elected as follows: 

First place, “Spirit of Dimas 
Alang,’’ Miss Helen Achay (Stock- 
ton); second place, “Victory,” Miss 
Marian Jacob (Watsonville); third 
place, “Liberty,” Miss Martha Yg- 
nacio (Oakland); fourth place, 
“Equality,” Miss Gloria Abarquez 
(Delano); fifth place, “Democ- 
racy,” Miss Ann Ramos (New Or- 
leans, La.) 

'The two Fighter Planes shall be 
named "Spirit of Dimas-Alang No. 

1, ” and “Spirit of Dimas-Alang No. 

2, ” and as the Fraternity continues 
to raise more money in Bonds for 
Fighter Planes, they shall be called 
“Spirit of Dimas-Alang No. 3,” etc. 
The Caballeros de Dimas Alang, 
Inc. hope to donate many fighter 
planes to the cause and help bring 
the war to an end. 



Japs Arrest 
Missionaries 
In Philippines 

Direct from Manila by radio 
came the news that the 500 mis- 
sionaries in the Philippines have 
been arrested by order of the Jap- 
anese army of occupation. Most of 
these missionaries are Americans. 
They were g;iven restricted free- 
dom from the beginning and were 
not interned with the American 
civilians. 'The charge against them 
is that they have engaged in esp- 
ionage and reported their findings 
to a central station somewhere in 
the country which relayed them to 
General MacArthuris headquarters. 







Miss Patricia De La Rosa, “Sweet 
heart” of the Navy in San Pedro 
is expected to visit Northern 
California soon. She is represen- 
tative of The MAIL in S. Calif.

Vargas Nervous 
In Tokyo 

From underground sources it is 
known that Jorge Vargas, ambas- 
sador to Japan of the Philippine 
puppet government, is verging on 
a nervous collapse as he imagined 
that when the Japanese are driven 
out of the Phiippines he would be 
so unpopular in his own country 
that he would have to stay in Jap- 
an the rest of his life. 

The news of the death of Presi- 
dent Quezon, who was his sponsor 
and support in public life before 
the war, has not helped his mental 
and physical condition. 



TO MEMO RY 

By Cpl. Alfonso P. Santos 

Again! Oh, why remind me of those things 
1 left behind : home, parents, relatives. 

Dear friends . . . and other things I deeply love: 

A beautiful girl who broke my heart, love-songs 
I sang to her, tear-stained love letters and 
Love notes I wrote to her, perfumed rose-leaves 
And’fragments of my broken heart she filed 
With my love letters . . . and the Philippines? 

Oh, why remind me of these things again? 

Look now, more come into my mind: night walks 
Along the seashore in the spring, blue moon 
And starlight on the river, camia flowers. 

And sampaguita blooms. You bring regret 

T o me. How shall 1 now again forget?

Retired General 
Suggests Caution 

General Junius Pierce, U. S. 
Army, retired, speaking from a 
radio station in Los Angeles re- 
cently, stated that before arming 
the Filipinos a careful finding 
must first be had to determine if 
they have not joined the Japanese 
either openly or silently. He made 
the statement on the strength of 
the report that the Japs have been 
doing everything in their power to 
befriend the Filipinos. 

He trusts th emajority of the 
EUipino people, but the misguided 
or misled ones must be ferreted 
out, he said. 



Our faith in President Osmena is strong, but confessedly 
we are not very much impressed by some of his appointments 
in the Cabinet and the departments which they head. We are, 
however, suspending final judgment until things become 
more settled and relatives merits are better weighed. 

The Cabinet is relatively not so very vital under the 
present circumstances. The more important body is the 
Philippine Rehabilitation Commission. Its membership not 
only should be representative of the different elements in 
the life of a nation but should bring together the best avail- 
able talents among the Filipinos, disregarding politics, per- 
sonalities and previous differences of opinions. The Presi- 
dent as an institution is the "melting pot" of all elements 
and the creator of a well-knit working body that will serve 
the nation effectively.

Has Philippine Plank 

SAN FRANCISCO, Cal.— Hon. 
Robert Kenny, State Attorney 
General and chairman of the Cali- 
fornia delegation to the Demo- 
cratic National Convention, is un- 
derstood to have under considera- 
tion a Philippine plank for incor- 
poration in the Democratic Plat- 
form. 'The plank will reiterate 
the grant of Philippine independ- 
ence after the war, commend the 
Filipinos for their loyalty and give 
assurance that independence will 
be protected and the reconstruc- 
tion of the Philippines assisted. 

'The Republicans failed to have 
a Philippine plank in their Plat-

Public Health In 
Grave Danger 

According to radio Tokyo, the 
Minister of Public Health and San- 
itation of the Philippines, Dr. Emi- 
lio Tria 'Tirona, has given sanitary 
inspectors the most strict orders to 

prevent the recurrence of plagues, 
especially cholera and smallpox, in 
the Philippines. Reports of cases 
were suppressed. 

Judging from the worries in high 
government circles in Manila, the 
entire sanitary and health sys- 
tems of the islands must be on the 
verge of collapse. 

Watchful Waiting 
Farmer's Attitude 



M. B. Masilongan, president oj 
the Filipino Ck>mmunity of Salinait 
Valley for two terms did not' 
choose to run for re-election when 
the election of officers for 1944 
was held at the Filipino Commui^ 
ity church during the regular meet? 
ing of the Community last Sun., 
day, August 13. 

Result of the election; Mr. M. PL' 
Galicia, president; F. S. Marat; 
vice-president; Miss Frances Gut^ 
ierrez, secretary; Robert Mara tag 
ass’t secretary; J. B. SampayanJ 
treasurer; F. B. Sun, ass’t. trea^ 
urer; and J. F. Cacas, auditor. 

During the meeting, presidenT 
Masilongan, appointed six dele- 
gates to represent the community! 
at the 6th annual convention of , 
the Inter-Filipino Community (rf) 
the Western States which will be- 
held in Fresno next month. Theyj 
are: Mr. F. S. Maratas, chairman; j 
Messrs. Fred Cabacungan, D. FJ 
Cruz, M. R. Galicia and Missi 
Frances Gutierrez and h i m s e 1 f. I 
Miss Gutierrez will act as alto^* 
nate. ' 

Installations of the newly elect- ! 
ed officers will be held some timei 
next month. i 



With the change of administra- 
tion in the Philippine government 
in Washington, Filipino farmers’ 
who have been promised loans and 
capital by Manuel Adeva of that 
government have adopted the at- 
titude of watchful waiting until 
President Osmena finishes the 
shuffling of the personnel. How- 
ever, many believe that nothing 
will come out of it and that there- 
fore they should go ahead and 
meet and discuss their problems on 
the basis of no government con- 
nection or participation. 



General Gomez 
Plnoy 'Himmler' 

General Guillermo (Gomez, fo^ 
merly of the Philippine Army, who 
fought in Bataan is now the near- 
est counterpart of the notorious 
Himmler of Nazi Germany. Gomez

betw^een 30,000 and 50,000 meni/ 
The force is organized as a na- 
tional unit and it is sometimes 
described as the army of the 
Philippine puppet government. 

There are many Jap officers in 
the organization. 

Gen. Gomez is in constant dan- 
ger of being assassinated by Fili- 
pino patriots who are against the 
collaborators.

FREEDOM FOR THE PHILIPPINES 

By Manuel M. Insigne 

Less than four weeks ajter the Pearl Harbor debacle a voice 
of a Filipino, speaking for those Filipinos outside of the Philip- 
pine government, was carried by short-wave from San Francisco 
to the Philippines. It was the voice of Mr. Manuel M. Insigne, 
now the Executive Editor of The AlAIL. He spoke over Radio 
Station KGEl at 2:45 A.M., January 13, 1942. 

Requests for the publication of his speech at the time were 
turned down because of the government policy in such matters, 
but now it is believed that there is no good reason why it should 
not be printed. After being introduced as speaking for the Fili- 
pinos, Mr. Insigne spoke as follows'. 

Brother Filipinos: 

1 come to you tonight as a spokesman for your fellow Fili- 
pinos living on the rich and bountiful Pacific slope of the United 
States. 

I bring to you a message, both in their behalf and my own. 
It is a message that you have heard from others before me, in 
these trying past few weeks. It**^

In Philippines 

In signing the Philippine Inde-

Roosevelt said: 

"The members approved today 
(June 29, 1944) will permit the ac- 
quisition of air and leuid bases in 
addition to naval bases and fuel- 
ing stations. I have been informed 
that this action is most welcomed 
to Commonwealth althorities, and 
that they will gladly cooperate in 
the establishment and mainten- 
ance of bases both as a restored 
Commonwealth and as an indepen- 
dent nation. By this we shall have 
an outstanding example of cooper- 
ation designed to prevent a re- 
currence of armed aggression and 
to assure the peaceful use of a 
great ocean by those in pursuit of 
peaceful ends."

is a message of determination — 
of OUR determination to help you 

in this hour of trial. 

All of you, I know, can well 
imagine the feelings of the Fili- 
pinos in America at a time when 
their beloved homeland is being 
ravaged by a foreign invader, who 
is bestial by nature, and whose 
rules of warfare, even, cannot be 
recognized by decent men any- 
where. 

You must know also that, if we 
had our choice, there is one place 
that we would wish to be, and that 
is by your side, now and for all 
time until the invader is repelled 
and EXpelled from our shores, and 
our sovereignty again is restored. 

Efforts toward that end are now 
under way, as I am sure you al- 
ready know. The War Depart- 
ment is preparing to accept hun- 
dreds, perhaps thousands, of Fili- 
pino volunteers. 

We are all trying to volunteer, 
under the established practices of 
the United States army. That is 
the FIRST thing we are doing — 
offering ourselves to help do the 
actual job of fighting this war, to 
fight it with you. 

As soon as arrangements are 
made to classify us in the armed 
forces, we plan to request the 
American command to form a sep- 
arate unit of Filipinos in America, 
to become an expeditionary force, 
upon direction of President Roose- 
velt, to journey to the Philippines 
and participate in the glorious mis- 
sion of redeeming the Philippines 
to their rightful place in the com- 
munity of free nations. ■ 

Until that day arrives, we must 
content ourselves with other forms 
of participation in this most cru- 
cial war. We must do all that we 
CAN do from here. We must help 
in every way that circumstances 
permit us to help — indirectly, per- 
haps, but in the best way we can. 

Now this form of assistance to 
our fellow Filipinos takes several 
forms. For one thing, we can 
help the Philippines by helping the 
United States in the war effort; 
for the Philippine Commonwealth 
and the United States of America 
are the most complete allies in this 
war. Together, they represent the 
most unsullied kind of sistership— 
fighting as they are this very night 
for their common freedom and 
their mutual democratic aims. 

So the things we have been do- 
ing for our country without de- 
lay are the things which we CAN 
do immediately to assist and make 
more solid the American effort in 
the war of the Pacific. 

We are contributing, for ex- 
ample, to the great and expanding 
war chest of the United States of 
America. This is direct aid, and 
it exerts a direct effect upon the 
battle you are waging at this mo- 
ment. The money which we con- 
tribute goes into the guns, the 
planes, the ships, the tanks and 
the equipment which is going to 
spell Victory and Freedom for the 
Philippines. 

We are, all of us, buying defense 
stamps and defense bonds. We are 
buying all of them that we can, 
according to our individual capa- 
city. We are holding mass meet- 
ings in order to transmit to all our 
fellow Filipinos the absolute neces- 
sity of their contributing from 
their daily earnings to the coffers 
which are making a victorious 
American war possible. 

My home is in Sacramento, the 
beautiful capital of California. I 
have lived in this (jolden State for 
fifteen ybars, and it has afforded 
me a bountiful and good life. I am 
an American and a Filipino, at one 
time, as all of you are, and I feel 
that I am a GOOD American and 
a GOOD Filipino. To be such, im- 
poses responsibilities, and affords 
privileges. The privileges I have 
enjoyed. 'The responsibilities I am 
ready to assume, now and always. 

In my city of Sacramento there 
is a Filipino — I shall not call him 
by name — whom we all of us re- 
spect, but" whom we have always 
regarded as something of ^ 

"Scrooge." You remember the en- 
during story of Charles Dickens, 
the "Christmas (2arol," in which 
he so ably depleted the character the fence — believe me — we are on 



of Scrooge, who preferred to hoard 
his gold, rather than spend it. 

Well, that is a perfcclly under- 
standable trait, and I am not, of 

course, criticizing, because this is 
a free country, and a man can do 
with his money what he chooses. 
But that is the sort of a man I am 
speaking of. Ho»was, I must say, 

something of a Scrooge, and that 
was his local reputation in our 
city. 

But, what do you suppose he did 
only a few days after the attack 
on Luzon? 

He went to his bank, and he 
drew out three thousand dollars, 
and bought defense bonds with it. 
Three thousand dollars worth of 
them. You can imagine the sur- 
prise to all of us who had known 
him as a man who would never 
spend a dime when he could avoid 
it. In addition, at our next mass 
meeting, this man pledged to buy 
TEN THOUSAND dollars worth of 
defense bonds — which I, inciden- 
tally, prefer to call "Victory 
bonds," for that is what they are. 

You see, this man had learned, 
through his own thinking, that 
there was something well worth 
spending money for — in ANY 
amount — and that is FREEDOM, 
for HIS people and for Americans. 
All that he held dear was wrapped 
up in that decision. Hisicntire life 
in America — the country which 
had blessed him with a business 
whereby he could earn all this 
money — as involved, and he kne^ 
it 

'This is only one case. There are 
thousands of others^ on the Pacific 
(i)ast— of Filipinos, loyal, deter- 
mined and patriotic, who are hur- 
rying to buy defense bonds, so 
that more equipment more guns, 
planes, ships, and tanks can be 
sent to redeem the Philippines, as 
President Roosevelt has pledged 
that this nation WILL do, without 
fail. 

So you can sec that we are giv- 
ing of our daily earnings. We are 
also giving of our daily labors. ‘The 
Filipinos of the Pacific Coast are 
among the most active population 
groups in helping the splendid 
work of the American Red Cross. 

We etre giving of our times — 
as well as money^to take part in 
the numerous activities of this 
great society. Also, we are pitch- 
ing in on the country-wide job of 
civilian defense, and you, if you 
were here, would see Filipinos 
taking just as much part in civil- 
ian defense, and all its ramifica- 
tions, as other Americans arc 
doing. 

We are looking aheacL also. We 
are tightening our belts for future 
war relief (X)ntributions to the 
Philippines. We feel sure that the 
needs of the Islands in war relief 
will be acute and large. And we 
are preparing to do more than our 
share in meeting them. 

Well, I wanted you to know 
something abcnit what we are do- 
ing from where we are — eight 
thousand miles away from our 
homeland. You can see that the 
distance is no barrier — ^that the 
sahie determination which activ- 
ates you in battle has leaped 
aenross the ocean, the broadest one 
in the world, and is activating us 
in our daily lives. 

But that is not ALL of my mes- 
sage. 'There is something else I 
wish to say. I know there have 
been numerous leaders of both 
American and Filipino life who 
have recently addressed you over 
the air, to tell you, and to 'RE- 
ASSURE you that victory artd 
freedom Is <»ming, that our na- 
tion WILL be free. 

I want to add my voice to their. 

I want to tell you that, as we see 
it on the Pacific Coast, there is 
NO QUESTION about the ulU- 
mate restoration of full independ- 
ence for the Philippines. If only 
you could see what we see here — 
the gigantic program which is now 
in full swing, to defeat and to 
crush the Axis in every quarter of 
the earth — then you would know 
as we do that there can be nothing 
BUT victory for us. In other 
words, we are on the right side of 




.MR. ANTONIO K. CRUZ 
though he insists that they could 

be solved. "What we need," Mr. 
Cruz said at an inter\iew, "is com- 
plete unity among our people. 'The 
presence of problems and the fail- 
ure of our leaders to come to 

intelligent analyses and immediate 
actions should be paramount con- 
cern of delegates attending the 
conference in Fresno. And it will 
not do us any good if our leaders 
continue to quarrel and be person- 
al even after they have won or lost 
the offices they have run for. No, 
I am making no definite promises. 
My record as a Filipino speaks 
well for my qualifications." 

Record Speaks 

For the information of delegates 
and Filipinos who are vitally inter- 
ested in making the Inter-Com- 
munity Organization a potent fac- 
tor in bringing about more solid- 
arity among Filipinos on the Pa- 



C. I. O. Urges 
Citizenship For 
Phiiipinos Now 

To clear the way for Filipinos 
to become American citizens, the 
California CIO Council executive 
board unanimous!^' went on rec- 
ord in favor of the Sheppard Bill 
(H- R. 4229), and urged the Demo- 
cratic party of California to in- 
clude the adoption of this bill In its 
19-14 platform. 

Calling sharp attention to the 
damage to United Statcs-Phllip- 
pines relations caused by c.xisting 
Federal statute which bars Fili- 
pinos from becoming American 
citizens, the CIO executive board 
urged Congress to pass the Shep- 
pard measure permitting Filipinos 
to be naturalized without "cer- 
tificate of arrival" or "declara- 
tion of intention" requirements. 
"Recent Congressional legis- 
lation has made It mandator)' 
that Filipinos be inducted Into 
the armed forces of this coun- 
try, without giving them tlie 
corresponding rights, preroga- 
tives and privileges inherent In 
American citizenship," the board 
pointed out. 

“By force of law, to compel Fili- 
pinos to share the burden of Amer- 
ican citizenship, such as to serve 
in the U. S. armed forces and to 
pay taxes, and at the same time 
deny them a voice in the govern- 
ment is unjust and undemocratic," 
the board asserted. 

The board's action was touched 
off by a resolution introduced by 
Dixie Tiller, regional director of 
CIO United Cannery, Agricultural 
& Packing Workers.

the right team in this bloody game. 

So, the only thing that we Fili- 
pinos in the United States can 
hope that our brothers at home 
will do, is to continue the fight — 
to permit no retrogression in the 
magnificent defense of the proud- 
est islands in the w’orld. 

I know, and we all of us know, 
that this is precisely what you are 
doing, and what you will continue 
to do. But, to bolster that, we 
want YOU to know that help is 
coming, and that its final sequel 
will be victory and freedom. 

Fight with all your heart and 
all your strength! You are fight-

time. You arc serving on the front 
lines of Democracy, and the battle 
you are waging will go down in 
history as one of the most valiant 
and most sacred in the chronicles 
of man. 

Jose Rizal would be proud of 
every one of you. He would find 
in each one of you a part of that 
inspired bravery which dignified 
him to the highest in our own his- 
tory'. He would know, if he could 
watch you going through this or- 
deal now, that you are as fine and 
as noble even eis he. 

Remember, throughout this bat-

lustrious Filipino of the past is 
with you, with you every moment 
of the day and night. And remem-

Filipinos Unimpressed 
By Broadcasts To PI 

Letters received from Filipino 
soldiers in the Southwest Pacific 
state that they listen to the radio 
broadcasts by O.W.I. from Aus- 
tralia or New Guinea to the Philip- 
pines. They don’t state what the 
broadcasters say, but they are of 
the opinion that what they say are 
not calculated to make a strong 
impression on the Filipino people 
who hear Uiem. 

It is known that there are not 
many short-wave sets in the Phil- 
ippines and the Japanese have 
made short-wave listening a seri- 
ous crime.

Osmena Cabinet 
Organized 

President Sergio Osmena’s Cabi- 
net is as follows: Jaime Hernan- 
dez, finance: Gen. Basilio J. Val- 
des, national defense; Col. Carlos 
P. Romulo, information and public 
relations; Col. Manuel Nieto, agri- 
culture and industry; Arturo B. 
Rotor, secretary to the President; 
Ismael Mathay, budget and finance 
commissioner; Col. Mariano A. 
Erana, judge advocate, detailed to 
the department of justice, labor 
and w'elfare. 

No Interior Secretary 

The Secretary of the Interior 
has not yet been appointed. This 
official will succeed the President 
if he does or is unable to ser\'e, 
since there is no vice-president at 
present. 

Mr. Jaime Hernandez was Audi- 
tor General appointed to serve for 
10 years, which has not yet ex- 
pired, under Section 1, Article X 
of the Constitution. He must 
have resigned as Auditor. 

The position of judge advocate 
is new. It is the law officer of 
the army. Col. Erana is a per- 
sonal friend of President Osmena 
and was in the U. S. Army in the 
judge advocate department. 

Mr. Mathay was assistant of 
the Auditor and Col. Nieto was 
military aide to the late President 
Quezon. His appointment to head 
the department of agriculture and 
industry is a great surprise. 



FRESNO 

MERRY-GO-ROUND 



By JULIAN CAMPOS 
Pres. Quezon of the Philippines, 
who died a few weeks ago, will be- 
missed by all of us, who love and 
admire him. It is very unfortunate 
that he died while in exile and not 
in his country, which he loved s(5 
much. 

But no matter where or how he 
died, in the field of battle or in 
the quiet room of a Saranac Lake 
hospital, history will record that 
he died fighting until his last 
breath for the liberation of his 
beloved country.

Difficulties: — _ 

Difficulties are the thorns in the I ^hat I mean. 



side of progress and stones in the 
path of ambition. They keep some 
men poor, the men who lack the 
vision and the understanding to 
overcome them. 

To other men, difficulties are the 
steps on which they build their 
success. The men who are stopped 
by difficulty are legion. The rea- 
son they have stopped is because 
they do not have the energy or the 
brains to figure the way. 

Beca»ise you have difficulty or 
opposition is no sign that you can- 
not go ahead. There are usually a 
dozen ways around every difficut- 
ly. Some one will serve you, pro- 
viding you use your brain. 

I often hear how SO and So 
is making his way in life. It would 
seem that he is doing it unaided. 
But the fact remains that no one 
makes his way entirely as a re- 
sult of his own effort. Of course, 
the would-be-successful man must 
use his brains to the best of his 
ability; must bestir himself and 
give his capacity for initiative a 

chance to assert itself.

Wit and Humor; — 

A busy life is the goal of human 
ambition. There is nothing bet-

interested and happy that time 
passes to quickly. 

The higher men climb the long- 
er their working day. Without im- 
mense and sustained effort he wiU 
not climb high. 

Many a man who hopes to wake 
up and find himself successful for- 
gets to set his alarm-clock. 

Many a young man who has re- 
fused to let the grass grow be- 
neath his feet has lived to reap a 
rich harvest.

In the moments of sorrow and 
doubt, in perplexities and trying 
experiences, the few MOTHERS in 
our community who are OFFER- 
ING their SERVICES for the ele- 
vation of the MORALE of the 
boys, are in a position to interpret 
every throb of a doubting and sor- 
rowing heart. They know that at 
heart these lads who came to 
Chicago after the long journey 
from home as seekers after wis- 
dom are splendid folks who, under 
ordinary conditions, could easily 
make their way or otherwise im- 
proving themselves. And to them 
these ladies of the community 
preach the GOSPEL of HOPE. 

To mention the few members of 
the community who are elevating 
fellowship to the boys are Mrs. 
Lee Reyes, Mrs. Gregoria Alamar, 
Mrs. Jose Finez, Mrs. Jean Poll-

Atty. Costosa 
May Be Called 

The mail’s correspondent in

attorney and owner of a Filipino 
placement office, may be asked 
to join the Philippine government 
in Washington. Many believe that 
Mr. Costosa can do the work of 
Mr. Manuel Adeva better, al- 
though the latter is reported to be 
trying his mighty best to prove 
that it was the unpopularity among 
the Filipinos of his then chief, Mr. 
Elizalde, resigned, that made his 
work distrusted by Filipinos. 

Looks like a case of passing the 
buck. 



We join the millions of Filipinos who mourn the death 
of President Quezon. May he Rest in Peace and may God 
Bless his soul. 



On this occasion, we also wish to congratulate 
His Excellency, President Sergio Osmena, the 
greatest living Filipino Statesman the Philip-

Party at the American Legion 
Hall, Wednesday evening, June 2,

ever attended in the San Joaquin 
Valley. It was sponsored by Mr. 
and Mrs. Andrew' Escalona, promi- 
nent Godparents of the child. 

'The party started with highballs 
and cocktails at eight o’clock, half 
an hour before dinner. The drinks 
were so abundant, it made you 
think Mr. Escalona brought his 
famous “Club Inn” into the party. 

'The dinner was of fried spring 
chicken, with sweet i>eas, sweet 
potatoes, rolls, coffee, ice cream 
and fruit salad. It was well served 
on tables arranged in “E” shape 
(Excellence) with sprays of ferns, 
dahlias. Zinnias and chrysanthe- 
mums in the center of the tables. 

The dinner was followed by a 
d 2 ince which lasted with increasing 
tempo and excitement until one 
o’dock the ne.xt morning. Music 
was played by the Filipino Palm 
Serenaders. 

Among the prominent guests 
were Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Hub- 
bard of the Board of Equalization 
of Kem County, Police Judge and 
Mrs. Lee Pryor of Delano, Mr. and 
Mrs. William Folke, Attorney and 
Mrs. Hugo McKinley, Mr. and

POR'TERVILLE, Calif.— 'The Fi- 
lipino Welfare Club of Porterville 
sponsored a very successful dance 
and bond rally on August 5 at the 
American Legion Hall. 

A big crowd turned out for the 
affair — ladies dressed in elegant 
“formcils" and boys, spending their 
hard and well earned dollars for a 
good cause to the hearty applause 
of the guests. 

I wish to salute the officers, who 
did a magnificent job: Pres. Severo 
Dulay, Vice-pres. Mariano Arming- 
ton, Sec. George De Vera, and 
'Treas. Marieino Espejo.

ing a telegram of condolence with 
flowers to the Quezon family. 



Question of the Hour: Who ai*e 
responsible for a young lady’s af- 
fliction? If and when the lid is 
off, it is going to shake the very 
foundation of a certain Filipino 
Community, Question of the Day: 
Why do members of the stag line 
cut in on a gentleman’s escort as 
soon as she enters the ballroom, 
forgetting all the rules of etiquette 
and consideration for the gentle- 
man who escorted her and natur- 
ally is entitled to her first dance 
of the evening? Question of the 
Month: Why don’t Filipino wives 
get together and form a club in- 
stead of gossiping about each 
other? Question of the Year: 
When is Philippine War Relief 
going to be started? After the 
boys are all broke again or right 
now that they are making good 
wages ?

people’s love and confidence than 
did Manuel L. Quezon at the hands 
of the Filipino people. His death 
wrill be taken in the Philippines as 
another terrible ordeal visited up- 
on a nation already so sorely tried 
by a brutal invasion, and only 
FUipino courage and fortitude can 
blunt the poigncint sorrow of so 
irreparable a loss. 

“Manuel L. Quezon was my dear 
and beloved friend. Our friend- 
ship has stood the test of all polit- 
ical differences and has remained 
throughout whole and unimpaired. 
My attachment to him was rooted 
in that genuine friendship that 
has melowed with the years into 
a real and abiding affection. He 
has gone to his reward, a valiant 
leader who will live forever in the 
hearts of his people. His memory 
will help me face the tasks that 
are ahead with the same devotion 
to the masses of our people which 
has characterized his administra- 
tion as President of the Philip- 
pines."

News Briefs 



Gregorio C. Aquino, Jr., editor 
of the Philippine Star Press of Los 
Angeles, ex-president of the Fili- 
pino Commnnlty of Monterey Pen- 
insula, president of the Rising Sons 
of Narvacan, has officially de- 
clared his candidacy for presidency 
in the forthcoming convention of 
the FICOWS which will be held In 
Fresno. Mr. .\qulno will repre- 
sent the Filipino Community of 
.>Ionterey Peninsula at the con-

By DOROTHY BARCELONA 

Editor’s Note: (Miss Barcelona 
was a school reporter in her junior 
year when in high school In Ha- 
waii. She graduated San Diego 
high school last year and plans to 
do some specialized training in San 
Diego Vocational School. Her spare 
time is now utilized in getting ma- 
terial for THE PHILIPPINES 
MAIL.) 

Purposely to elect delegates to 
FICOWS Convention in Fresno 
September 11 to 14, the Philippine 
Council of San Diego County called 
a special meeting Sunday, July 23, 
1944 at the home of Mr. Victor 
Barcelona. 

Many attended the meeting, in- 
cluding women, but very few want 
to go to Fresno. The reason is 
simple — they are all tied to war 
industry. A day off would mean 
a lot to the enemy. 

So to remedy this demand for 
the convention, at the regular 
meeting of the Philippine Council, 
every one was asked whether he 
desired to attend the convention at 
Fresno. Out of the many, only 6 
accepted and were all delegated to 
represent San Diego. 

'They are J. Guzman, L. Tabinga, 
P. Ck)ntang, S. Parojinog, Dr. M. 
Marquez and Secy. Fred Masca- 
rinas. 



The death of President M. L. 
Quezon was a shock to San Diego 
community. Appointment to some 
important business were postponed 
and special meetings of the Philip- 
pine CJouncil was rushed for this 
purpose. 

The Philippine Council at their 
previous meeting had a minute ap- 
proved that on President Quezon’s 
birthday a dance on Turner Hall 
will be held in his honor, but sud- 
denly the radio all over the nation 
anounced the death of this man 
whose life was devoted to his 
country. 

The council all with sad expres- 
sions on their faces postponed the 
dance. All are now mourning for 
the President. 




Aroused by patriotic duty to 
help the United Nations and most 
fully to the dying men, women and 
children in the Philippines Mrs. 
Padua organized the Pinay in San 
Diego into a Junior Red C^ss. 

At the Philippine Council’s regu- 
lar meeting, Mr. Padua was given 
permission to introduce his wife 
who enthusiastically stood up and 
announced her purpose. “'This war 
time," she said, “each of us must 
do something in return to what 
our brothers and sisters bleeding 
and suffering from the torture of 
the enemy in the Philippines." 

She asked if she could make 
shorts and undershorts for the 
Philippine population in connection 
with the PHILIPPINE WAR RE- 
LIEF program ? 

“Of course, we will!" she an- 
s^vered emphaticaly. That’s a part 
of the Red Ooss work. 

'The council assured her its sup- 
port and in case they fail to make 
an accomplishment of their work, 
the men members of the council 
will surely help. 

Present at the meeting were: 
Mr. and Mrs. L. Tobias, Mr. and 
Mrs. P. Gontang, Mr. and Mrs. 
Padua, L. Tabinga, Engineer A. 
Lansangan, Simm Parojinog, Mrs. 
CMstado and two daughters, Rita 
and Martha, Dr. M. Marquez, J. 
Besana, J. Guzman, Mr. Samson, 
Mr. and Mrs. C. Dangan, Fred 
Mascarinas, the Barcelona sisters, 
Freda and Dorothy. 

Soft drinks were served after 
the meeting was adjourned.

Candido Elbo 
Pres. Secretary] 

It is expected that veteran 
Washington official Candido Elbo 
is going to be President Osmena’s 
Secretary. He was Mr. Osmena’s 
secretary when the latter was vice-J 
president. Before that, he joined 
the Resident Commissioner’s of- 
fice, Mr, Elbo was the private sec-| 
retary of the late Resident C^om- 
missioner Pedro Gueveura. 

Mr. Elbo knows the ropes in 
Washington, knows many impor" 
tant officials, is well educated, po-^ 
pular with the Filipinos and ef- 
ficient and intelligent. He is the i 
president of the Filipino Elxecu- : 
tive (^uncil of Washington, D. C. i 
He has always stood by the real ; 
Filipinos and sincere Filipinism • 
and his patriotism is an establish- 
ed fact. 

Secretary Elbo’s loyalty to and 
admiration for President Osmena^ 
are beyond question. His faith in | 
his chief never wavered. Whenl 
nearly all in the Philippine gov-^ 
emment were for President Que- 
zon during the fight on the Presi- 
dential Succession, Mr. Elbo stood 
firmly and aggressively by the 
then Vice-President Osmena. 

(Editor’s Note; — Dr. Arturo B. 
Rotor, Secretary of late President 
Quezon was continued as Presi- 
dent Osmena’s secretary.) 



S. Ugarte Is 

Now Major 

Just before he died, President 
Quezon appointed Sebastian Ug- 
arte, legal adviser of Com. Eli- 
zalde, a Major in the Philippine 
Army and designated as Execu- 
tive Director in the Department of 
National Defense of which Gen.^ 
Valdes is the Secretary. ^

ROMULO BECOMES P. I. RESIDENT COMMISSIONER 



AS I SEE rODAY 



GREAT ADVERTISING MEDIUM 



RELIABLE FOR SIXTEEN YEARS 



By G. C. Aquino, Jr. 

I feel it is my (^ligation to the 
Filipino* of the WcMcrn State* to 
be on record of what I really stand 
for. 

WHY I RUN R)R PRESIDENT 

You might ask me the question, 
Why do you run for President of the 
Filipino In'cr-Communiiy Organi- 
zation of the Western States? My 
anvw'cr i« obvious. I want to serve 
my countrynfKn. I want to put the 
Inter- Community Organization 
where it should be. If clco»cJ Presi- 
dent, I will try my best to execute 
the resolutions passed by the conven- 
tion. My administration will *up- 
p»ort citizenship for Filipinos fof the 
sake of those who want to stay in 
this country; it will try to solve the 
farm problems. My administration 
will promote Philippine War Relief; 
it will promote a closer relation be- 
tween the communities and the In- 
ter-Community organization, and 
between the Fiilipinos and the Am- 
erican people. My administration 
twill, cooperate with the officials of 
the Commonwealth of the Philip- 
pines and with die officials' of this 
great nation for the welfare of the 
Filipinos. These are the things I 
really stand for. To accomplish 
these, my organization will find the 
means for the prpsccution of those 
obicclives. 

THE ORGANIZATION 
The Filipino Intcr-Communiiy 
Organization has the bes: opportu- 
nity fo unite all Filipinos, in the 
Western States. It is really the or- 
ganization that can unite vis. ITiis 
is said tb be the belief of the late 
Honorable Francisco Varona; v): 
know that the organization was for- 
med liy the Filipino communities 
through his initiative We knew 
further that the communities arc 
the common grounds of all Filipi- 
nos. We cannot deny that. But 
has the organization united the Fili- 
pinos here in the Western States? 
Frankly speaking, it has not <lonc 
yet. There arc manv critics of the 
organization because it has not done 
the things that it should have dont 

do scmcihing loirtrc 
Filipinos before it can unite us. j 
This thing can never be done un- 
less we have the right leader, the 
leader who has the determination to 
serve his countrymen faithfully. 
That is why we must beware of 
pretentious, boastful and flaming 
promises. Let us examine those 
candidates carefully with regards 
to their background. man with 
out a black mark has the best as- 
set to unite uj. W^c cannot believe 
those men who have taken the ad- 
vantage over their unfortunate 
countrymen; wc can only believe 
those men who have served their 
countrymen faithfully, no mailer 
how small that service <wa$. It is 
only the latter type of men who 
can unite the Filipinos in the West- 
ern Stales. 

SAN FRANCISCO WOMEN 
Filipino women of San Francis- 
co really deserve to be congratulat- 
ed. Very few Filipinos, perhaps, 
know about their activities. They 
arc supporting and supervising the 
activities of the Filipino Children’s 
Club of San Francisco. The author 
of this article learned that a prog- 
ram of teaching the American born 
Filipino children the Filipino cul- 
ture is already in process. History of 
the Philippines, gfcography, folk 
dances, native songs, and all the 
bright sides of the Philippines arc 
being taught* to the children who 
never had the chaiKc to sec the 
native land of their parents. It is 
further learned by the author that 
a class of at least once or more a 
week ij being sough: of the women 
leaders of the said city. It is very 
interesting to note that some Filijri-

His Excellency Sergio Osmena 



TAKES OATH AS NEW P. I. PRESIDENT 



Sergio Osmena look his oath of 
office recently as P»rcsidcnt of the 
Philippines following the death of 
Manuel L. Quezon. Justice Robert 
H. Jackson of the United States Su- 
preme Court administered the oath 
at 2:40 PM August IS. in the offices 
of Secretary Harold L. Ickes, IX*- 
arimcnt of Interior. Washington, 



pa 

D. C. I’hc solemn ceremony w.as 
witncsscil by officials of the Phili|>- 
pincs and United Staics Govern- 
ments and mcmlKrs of the press. 

After the oath of office had been 
administered, President Sergio Os- 
mcha said: 

“I am conscious of the tremend- 
ous responsibility that is mine as I 



nos in that section have signified 



their in*cnticn to vo’untcer as 
school teachers. 

Thk-is one of the best if not the 
best project that Filipino women 
in this country have undertaken. 
Filipino children born in this coun- 
try must know at least something 
about the history of the Philippines. 
Who knows some day they might 
go to the native land of their par- 
ents to live. Anything can happen 
these days. 

The Filipino Children’s Club of 
San Francisco is an ideal one, I 
think, to be followed by Filipino wo- 
men of other communities. Its pro- 
gram is for the welfare of (he Fili- 
pino children; it inculcates^into the 
minds of the children the bright 
and good things about the native 
land of their parents. It is the ob- 
ligation of the parents, therefore 
lo teach the facts about the Philip- 
pines.

Mrs. Gonzales 



Board Member 



Recently the Board of Directors 
of the American Red Cross, Carmel 
chapter, appointed forty honorar)’ 
members of the Board of Directors 
in the vicinity of Carmel. One of 
these is Mrs. Caridad Gonzales, Pre- 
sident of the Filipino Community 
of Monterey Peninsula. Mrs. Gonza- 
les is the first Filipino woman, per- 
haps, to be given such an honor. 



Colonel Andres Soriano resigned 
from the Cabinet as Sccrctar)’ of 
Finance on April 13, 1944, but Pre- 
sident Quezon asked that he con- 
tinue in office in view of the fact 
that he was entrusted with import- 
ant matters affecting Philippine re- 
habilitation, currency and other mo- 
netary problems. After completing 
his work, he again- insisted on his 
resignation which was fin.a'.ly ac- 
cepted by the latp Prc“idcnt, cffr.t- 
ivc July 31, 1944. 

When the Cabinet was informed 
of the .acceptance of his resignation 
on July 14, the following resolution 
was unanimously passed: 

“Whereas, Colonel Andres Soria- 
no has served his Government loy- 
ally and unselfishly, and given un- 
stinted cooperation to all rhe mem- 
bers of the Cabinet, 

“Resolved, that the Cabinet wish 
Colonel Andres Soriano godipjcd 
m his journey and success In his 
new assignment.” 

President Osmena in his press 
conference yesterday mentioned 
that Colonel Soriano was not 
included in the reorganized Ca- 
binet because he bad resigned as 
Secretary of Finance before the 
new President assumed office, 
and because he insisted that he 
be sent back to the front. Col- 
onel Soriano is soon leaving for 
the Southwest Pacific.

Wool and Rubber 



Garment Storage 



People fortunate enough to pos- 
sess war scarce woolen garments 
and war rationed rubber clothing 

should guard them w’cll against 



clothing moths and the hazards of 
Improper storage, believes Mrs. 

Margaret Todd, home demonstra- 
tion agent in Los Angeles county, 

representing the Agricultural Ex- 
tension Service' of the University 
of California.

Butzy Dies at Hospital 



1524 KERN ST. 



FRESNO, CALIF. 



Moth control and proper stor- 
age of winter clothing are espec- 
ially important this year and every 
effort should be made to take 
care of the clothing on hand. A 

special circular entitled ''Storage 
of Civilian Clothing" has been 
prepared covering care and stor- 
age of woolen, rubber, cotton, 
linen, and rayon clothing. Copies 
may he obtained without cost

county, 808 North Spring Street, 
Los Angeles 12. _ 



The only pet of the Aquinos 
family of Los Angeles was gone. 
He died at the Ambassador Hos- 
pital for dogs and cats at Los 
Angeles on the 8th of this month. 
He was twelve years old when he 
met death. The Doctor said that 
he died of poison. Nobody knows 
who committed the crime against 
that faithful dog of the four 

Aquino children (Cpl. George 
who Is now at a military hospital 

after he was sent for air cadet 
training, 1st Lt Frank who is now 
somewhere in the Southwest Pa- 
cific. Rd. 2/c Herny who is some- 
where in the Pacific Coast, and 
Betty who is now on leave from 
the Aeronauatic Administration). 
They will surely miss Butzy when 
they will come home; for Butzy

The resignation of Kelvin C. 
Yanderlip as senior housing repre- 
sentative of the National Housing

Williams, manager of the county's 
16 War Housing Centers. Vander- 
lip was succeded by Gilbert C. 
Lamb, formerly manager of the 
War Housing Centers In San Ber-

Active for almost three years in

"NHA has porgrammed more

Yanderlip said today, but pointed

available to the thousands of 
others who have come to Califor-

Seeds to Feed 



The World 



An American soldier In a prison 
camp In Germany may receive a 
packet of United States grown 
seed to enable him to grow his 
own Togetables. 

Russian peasants returning to 
devastated farms are planting 
seeds from America. 

Soldiers, sailors, and marines of 
our armed forces are eating fresh 
vegetables on every island where 
vegetable growing is practicable. 

All this Is possible because 
American fanners have, according 
to C. V. Caatle, farm advisor in 
Tvos Angeles county, representing 
the Agricultural Ebctenslon Service 
of the University of California, 
produced not only enough seed for 
our own needs and for a reserve, 
but eighteen million pounds more 
shipped by the War Food Admin- 
istration and other federal agen- 
cies to various parts of the world. 
There was enough seed to pro- 
duce two billion dollars worth of 
food; enough to feed 500 million 
people or one-fourth of the world’s 
population for a year. 

Seed to feed the world. From 
America's farms! This is one of 
the American farmera’ important 
war contributions.

Disposal of Government-Owned Surplus 

Plant and Goods 

C.E.p. STATEMENT ON NATIONAL POLICY 

An optimistic attitude toward the postwar problems of disposing of 
government-owned surplus goods and war plants is expressed by the 
Committee for Economic Development in a Statement on National Po- 
licy' issued by its Research Committee. E^tidcd “Postwar Employmenr 
and the Liquidation of War Production,*' this statement deals with (i) 
disposal of governnicnt-owcnd surplus goods. (2) disposal of govern- 
ment-owned industrial plants and facilities, (3) termination of war con- 
tracts. 

In sounding a note of optimism, C.E.D. warns that “it will be idle 
to protend that the liquidation of war production is not one of the most 
compheated tasks which the nation has had to face.” Nevertheless, the 
^atement asserts, the magnitudes of these problems do not justify a de- 
featist attitude, if prompt and coordinated plans arc prepared in ad- 
vance for handling them. 



Monday, August 28, 1844^ 



The C. E. D. statement is pre- 
sented both as an expression of the 
views of the businessmen members 
of its Research Committee, and as 
a summary of the principal conclu- 
sions of a C. E. D. research study 
by Professor A. D. H. Kaplan, Dean 
of School of Business Administra- 
tion, University of Denver, on leave. 
Dr. Kaplan’s book, the result of 
more than a year of intensive study 
has been published by che McGraw 
Hill Book Cximpany under the title 
^ The Liquidation of War Product- 
ion. It is the second in a scries 
of research studies sponsored by che 
C. E. D. Research Commitce, of 

which Ralph E. Flanders is chair- 
man. 

DISPOSAL OF GOODS —“If 
the 'War should end tomorrmv’’, C. 
E. D. estimates, goverrunent-owned 
surplus goods would probably not 
exceed % 6 o billion. But from the 
point of view of business the pro- 
blem is far smaller than this sum 



and practical business experience.^ 

Professor Kaplan’s study can be 
purchased at or through any book- 
store, but not from C. E. D. The 

C. E. D. Statement on National Po- 
licy can be obtained without charge 
from any of the 1907 local C. E. D’s, 
the district office at 519 Pacific Mu- 
tual Bldg., Los Angeles, 14, Calif., 
or from the national office at 285 
Madison As'enuc, New York 17, 
N. Y. 

Outstanding Points from the C.E. 

D. Statement on National Policy in- « 
chide: 

I ) A warning that “the success 
of the transition will depend in large 
measure upon the readiness of the 
private economjc sectors of the nat- 
ion — agriculture, business and labor 
— to sublimate their desires fo rtem- 
porary advantage into the greater 
satisfaction of restoring the econo- 
my to a healthy and durable pros- 
perity. The sacrifices of war will be 



would indicate. Three quarters of having won victory in glo- 

thc surplus stocks will be combat warfare, we engage in an all- 

ordnance. Of the $15 billion that is struggle of economic interests 




magnitude to only 2 monihrs 
normal retail sales. While there may 
be heavy over-supply in special li- 
.,fhc great bulk of the stock can 
be disposed of without seriously in- 
terfering with the rcadadj ustment 
of business lo peacetime production, 
provided the disposal is carefully 

planed in advance and properly 
limed. 

piSPOS.\L OF PLANT -- CED 
^timaics that the government has 
iovesicd $33 billion in plant and 
facilities during the emergency. But 
p7-5 billion of it reprcscots.military 
installations. Of the remaning Si 5.5 
billion, perhaps half will consist of 
large surplus facilities in such lines 
as shipyaids, aircraft, aluminum and 
magnesium. Probably not more than 
$5 billions, or about onc-ihird of 
the total, can be readily converted 
into a net effective addition to the 
nation’s peacetime plant. Since $5 
billion represent's only about two 
years of normal investment in plant 
c.xpasion, the end of the war will 
fid US *\s ilh no. over-all excess plant 
capacity, ap.irt from the' lines men- 
tioned. but rather under-equipped 
for full peacetime production 

Proper handling of government 
plants will constiiurc, C. E. D. says, 
a problem which will call for “dar- 
ing busienss statesmanship," It ’.vlll 
require great ingenuity in the con 
version of facilities to pca'cclimc use 
and bold dismantling of many 
which cannot be con\"ertcd. The pro- 
blem of the plants which can be suc- 
cessfully converted should be solved 
preferably by outright sale to pH- 
vatc operators, or else by long lease 
or by experimental “sliding-scale 
lea cs", according to circumstances. 

CONTRACT TERMIN.ATION- 

Of a possible $80 to $ too billion of 
uncompleted war contracts which 
would be outstanding “if the war 
should end tomorrow", C. E. D. 
estimates that total claims will not 
exceed a maximum of Sio billion 
and that the area of possible dispute 
between contractors and government 
•NviU not exceed $1.5 billion. Urging 
the utmost speed in termination set- 
tlement, C. E. D. asserts that the 
cost to the nation of unnecessary 
delays, in terms of lost production 
and in morale of unemployed work- 
ers, could be vasdy greater than 
any savings which might accrue to 
the government. 

C. E. D. Research — In writing 
the research study on which the C. 
E, D. statement is based. Professor 
Kaplan had the benefit of continu- 
ing jssi-Nt.incc of the C. E. D. Rc- 
Mrarch Staff, headed by Professor 
Theodore C). Y’ntcma, and of fre- 
quent day-long conferences with the 
outstanding social scientists of the 
TWEL\'E— Aquino 
Research Advisory Board and the 
businessmen of the Research Com- 
mittee. Thus, as with all C. E. D. 
research studies, this report though 
representing Professor Kaplan’s own 
fintdings and opinions, results from 



on the home front as wc go through 
the transition period.” 

2) Recommendation that the gc- 



merchantablc, fully half will be lo- 
cated abroad. The remaining $6 or 
$7 million, only part of which is 

consumer goods, is equivalent in mcral objective guiding surplus dis- 
dollar mapnitudr tn n»lv . ^ making the 

surplus goods available to consumers 
and other ultimate users on the wid- 
est, possible scale. 

3) Recommendation that the guid 
ing policy in surplus disposal be 
one of making the surplus goods 



ultimate users on the widest possible > 
scale. ! 

3) Recommendation that the 
guiding policy in surplus disposal 
be one of encouraging private busi- 
ness under competitive conditions. 

4) Insistence that disposal of sur- 
pluses, like disposal of plant, should 
be coordinated under a central gov- 
ernment policy body. 

5) Recommendation that equal 
opportunity be guaranteed to all 
businessmen bidding for govern- 
ment surplus stocks, with special 
consideration to small business and 
withsafeguards against acquisition 
of stocks for the furtherance of 
monopoly. 

6) Recommendation that no mcr 
chantabdc stocks be frozen for long 
periods, but on the other hand that 
dumping and depression of prices 
be avoided by means of carefully 
timed disposal policies. 

7) Recommendation that original 
cost price should not necessarily be 
rigidly adhered to in selling surplus- 
es and plant, but, on the other hand, 
that prices should not be so low as 
to give certain businesses an unfair 
competitive advantage or to subsi- 
dize sub-marginal production aftei 
the war. 

8) Warning that war production 
should in no case be continued me- 
rely to provide employment, and 
that civilian production should be 
planned in advance to take its place 
as quickly as possible. 

9) Recommendation of early de- 
cision by military authorities as to 
which stand-by plants arc lo be re- 
tained against future emergencies. 

10) Emphasis on the need of pro- 
tecting small business in disposal of 
surplus stocks and plants, under 
policies which should be eprcssly 
laid down by (Congress.

Prompted doubtless by the desire of Filipino residents on the Paci- U Conimrccial 

fic Coast to improve and elevate their present station in life, attempts Resident Comm; 

were made to unify them into a body known as the Filipino Intcr-Com- 
munity Organization of the Western States. Is it not throwing cold 
water upon the hopes of those who adopted the Preamble of the cons- 
titution of this organization, that, instead of carrying out the intent and 
purpose of the resolutions adopted, most of the time is wasted in need- 
less discussions. There arc many very rccommcndablc provisions in the

following phrase: “Organized Fili

States functioning in eboperation 
with the Office of the Philippine 
Resident Commissioner to the Unit-

it means that local Filipino Com- 
munities were organized to cooper- 
ate with the Office of the Philippine 
Resident Commissioner and that, in 
return the Resident Commissioner 
will cooperate with them in solv- 
ing their complicated problems, how 
ever his office seems to take a dif- 
ferent view of the matter. 

Since the Filipino Intcr-Conimu- 
fiity Organization has been establish 
cd the delegates representing 45 
cities from the coast have met five 
times. The sixth conference is sche- 
duled to be held from Sept, ii to

pJenty of action not only big talk. 

Some civic minded Tilipino lead- 
ers blame the (jovermem officials 
in Washington and specifically the 
Resident Commissioner who accord- 
ing lo the constitution is the official 
advisor of the Inter-Cx)mmunity Or- 
ganization, for giving so much ad- 
vice and promises that, al times, his 
office finds itself powerless to act. 



P. I. Rehabilitation 
Commission 

President Sepgio Osmena of the 
Philippines designated Jaime Her- 
nandez, Secretary of Finance, as 
Chairman of the Filipino group in 
the Filipino Rehabilitation Commis-

Mrs. Pilar H. Lim, former Pres- 
ident of the National Federation 
of Women’s Clubs in the Philippines

Livestock Growers 
Cheered by Improved 
Feed Situation 

Reduction in livostock numbers 
and good crops of barloy in Cali- 
fornia and grain sorghuins in Tex- 
aH make for a better feed situa- 
tion for California producers, was 
Iho report of Gail McDowell, a 
member of the State -^^^nl• Uonrd 
food committee, to the Ixis An- 
gelos county Farm Bureau’s Dairy- 
j men's Department. 

Mr. McDowell, who is a promi- 
nent duirymaii and feed man, also 
stated tliat because of tho short 
crops of flux and cotton, oil meals 
would remain in a tight situation, 
it was hla bollofo, however, that 
because of the reduction In poul- 
try and hogs dairymen would be 
able to obtain tho necessary 
amount of protein to maintain 
milk production. 

C. V. Caatle, farm advisor .. in 
I^s Angelca county, representing 
th® Uoivenity of California Agri- 
cultural lilxtension Sor>ico. report- 
* ed that in. spite of tho reduction 
! In livestock numbers California 
will need to bring in over 900.000 
tons of feed groins. Some of tbia 
grain will be lirought In from 
Australia and Argentina, but roost 
of It will have to como In from 
oiiicr slates by rail and its raov«- 
nunt may be hindered by trans-

you will have your own milk and 
butter, eggs and poultry, moat and 
vocntablos? A place where you 

can settle clown to enjoy life and 
make a comfortable living be- 
lidea? 

If you have aucb plans, toko 
tbIa little advice — don't go farm- 
ing unlcaa you're prepared to faco 
long, back-breaking, houra of work 
and low prices. Maybe you Uiink, 
“why should anyone Itn taking ad- 
vice Irom a 16 year old Inexperi- 
enced girl?" Woli, all 1 can say 



prevent prices from lowering onco 
we return to normal ccndltlcn\ 

I I guess all farmcra know that 
farming is, and always has b:cn, 
a gamble. Those who would buy 
a farm for security must realko 
thot tho security is there only if 

they get good crops anJ gooJ 
prices. You might get a I l .1 crop 

failure for three years In tuicac- 
aion. You may put your seed in 
the ground and it may ret there 
through too much moisture. Or it 
may como up and d o from lack 
of water. W*hen you do get a 
good crop tho price may drop lo 
the bottom. All farmers have 



is that my father had all the cx- lo know and accept ihoae ha^ar^s. 



IM’rlonrea in farming, twenty-two 
yean of oxporienco is fanning. 

E\nry atcond person you meet 
talk.H of putting all hia savings 
Into a little farm after the war. 
Tlie irotibln la that they Imagine 
that tanning will bo a mutJi more 
profitable business than it Is dur- 
ing the war yean, but I’ve learned 
differently, the Department of Ag- 
rlcullunB states, that no power can 



So. again I says don't go fam - 
ing unless you’re prepared to faro 
long, back-breaking houra of work.

1. Gasoline shortage. Though 
total production of gasoline on 
the Pacific Coast during June was 
very high at 298,000 barrels daily, 
.total demand was even higher at 
362,000 barrels ' per day. This 
meant dipping into reserve sup- 
plies for the deficit of 54,000 bar- 
rels per day and thus seriously 
reducing the Coast's reserve. 

2. Automobile shortage. Cars are 
wearing out and being junked at 
a reported rate of five thousand 
per day throughout the nation. 

3. The recently established OPA 
rule to meet these shortages re- 
quires applicants for B and C sup- 
plementary gas rations to show 
that they are in car-sharing pools, 
if they want gas for home-to-work 
driving. 

To save their cars, gas, and 
tires, three or more motorists can 
get together and take turns in 
using each other’s cars for getting 
to work, under the War Council’s 

“Los Angeles plan”

past, emphasis was placed on 20,- l/HllllUvr LnUUlJvJ

Todd home demonstration agent 
in Los Angeles county, represent- 
ing the Agricultural Extension 
Service of the University of Cali- 
fornia, says 7,500 of these acci- 
ednts, over a third of them, were 
in the farm home. 

Fall accounter for 39 per cent 
of these home accidents, caused 
bby slippery rugs, broken linoleum, 
makeshif equipment used as step- 
ladders, food or water spilled on 
the floor and not wiped up, furni- 
ture misplaced in the room, rick- 
ety steps, or poorly lighted stair- 
ways, and other causes. 

Burns caused 25 per cent in 
canning and other accidents in- 
volving fire or heat. 

Poisons caused six per cent of 
the accidents and firearms were 
responsible for seven per cent.

Importance of Early Planting 
of Fall and Winter Crops 



Gardeners are urged to plant 
all fall and winter garden vege- 
tabes promptly at the recommend- 
ed dates. Many experiences of 
slow plant growth and poor yields 
can be traced to belated plant- 
ings. Such crops as broccoli, cab- 
bage, carrots, and head lettuce 
must develop into large plants 
during teh late summer before 
cool fall weather if they are to 
yield their best Any substantial

It is now twenty seven days since the greatest Filipino lead- 
er passed away. 'Tn death there is rest,*’ said Rizal in his poem, 
”My Last Farewell.” In the last words of Rizai the late Presi- 
dent Manuel L. Quezon of the Philippines is now resting from 
his labors for he has labored bard for the exaltation and elevation 
of the Filipino race. 

”Manuel Quezon’s death will be a great shock to the people 
of the Philippines who so keenly anticipated bis return to Ma- 
nila. He was the very apotheosis of the aspirations of Filipinos 
f or th e higher things of life. A great liberal, his fame and glory 
will increase as his policies gradually approach fruition.” re- 
marked General Douglas MacArthur about the death of his long- 
time friend and associate. mourn him.” 



For the last thirty years, the late President was the accepted 

leader of the Fili^^inos. No man of the world today has ever 

maintained such length of leadership and yet loved by the great- 
. 

est majority of his people. That is the highest tribute that a 
nation can give to its leader. HE WAS A FEARLESS FIGHT- 
ER FOR PHILIPPINE FREEDOM; FOR FREEDOM OF 
THE FILIPINOS WAS IN HIS HEART. His friends as well 
as his enemies in the fields of politics have always respected the 

noble-minded Quezon because of his clear vision. 

He was a quick thinker and was always ready to give his 
decision or judgement with regards, to Philippine national po- 
licy whenever a crisis arises. Every decision he made with regards 
to foreign and domestic policy of the Philippines was always 



accepted by the greatest majority of the Filipinos. This sig- 
nified the fact that the idol of the Filipinos bad always used his 
sound, perfect and faultless judgment. 

”The story of Manuel L. Quezon’s life is the story of a 

people who love freedom and are ready to sacrifice for it. He is 
not really dead. He lives in the heart of eighteen million Fili- 
pinos. and in that of every man who loves freedom,” said Pre- 
sident Osmena who knew the most about the late President in the 
fields of Philippine politics. Yes, the name of Manuel L. Que- 
zon will never die. It remains in the heart of every Filipino who 
loves freedom from generation to generation until the world is 
no more.

meho, V’icc President of the Phillpes-

morating the loth anniversary of 
the opening session in ManiL of 
the Constitutional Convention that 
drafted the Constittution of the

“July 30 is a mcmoraUc day in 
Philippnnc history. On that day 
lci\ years ago the Filipino people 
through their duly elected delegates 
met in convention in Manila to 
draft their constitution. It was a 
momentous event, marking as it did 
not only the culmination^ of Amcr 
ica’s Philippine policy of Wlf-govcrn 
ment and freedom, but also the cli- 
max of the long and arduous strug- 
gle of the Filipino people for a free, 
responsible and constitutional gov- 
emmcnl. 

“During the Spanish regime, the 
Philippines was governed by special 
laws oidiich were extended by Royal 
Decrees. Unlike Cuba and Puerto 
Rico, to which certain constitution- 
al rights were eventually granted, 
the Philippines, despite repeated 
petitions and rccommend-ations, 
was kept outside t h c protect 
lion of the Spanish Constitution, 
nly for short -periods of time and at 
intervals was the Philippines repre- 
sented in the Spanish Cortes. 

"When the Filipino people, ^un- 
heeded in their clamor for a rc'prc- 
sentaiivc government and frustrated 
in their every peaceful move for re- 
forms, finally revolted against Spain, 
one of the first things they did af- 
ter the Spanish power was ocr- 
ihrown was to give vent to their 
long cherished aspiration for a cons- 
tituiianal government. The result 
was the famed Malolos Constitu- 
tion, the general oudincs of which 
closely followed the Constitutions of 
Spain, Chile and Costa Rica. The 
Malolos Constitution, however, was 
shortlived, for, with the cession of 
the Philippines to the United States 
through the Treaty of Paris, the Fi- 
lipinos passed under the socrcigniy 
of the United Stales. 

“The Constitution of the United 
States did not allow the American 
flag to the Philippines. From the

inception of American occupation, 
however, the United Suics proclaim 
cd before the world that it was 
her purpose to act as trustee of the 
Filipino people - to educate, elevate 
and train them for self-government 
and freedom. Her policy was sum- 
med up in the historic phrase, ‘The 
Philippines for the Filipinos.’ 

“In pursuance of such commit- 
ment, Congress passed various or- 
ganic acts for the Government of 
tltc Philippines, bearing in mind as 
a paramount consideration the wel- 
fare of the Filipino people and their 
consiinuously increasing participa- 
tion in the Government of their 
country. In 1902 it passed the 
Cooper Law, which provided a ci- 
vil government cou{^ed with the 
eventual establishment of a popular 
Assembly; in 1916 it passed the 
Jones Law, .adding to the elective 
Assembly and elective Senate, thus 
vesting in the Filipino people the 
whole legislative power in the is- 
lands. 

“But important as these two Or- 
ganic Acts were and substantial as 
were the concessions involved, they 
<lid not represent the will of the Fi- 
lipino people nor allow them to 
draft their own Organic Act. The 
momentous concession was to come 
later with the passage of the Tyd- 
ings-McDuffic Aor. of 1934, granting 
independence to the Philippines, ef- 
fective July 4, 1946, and authorizing 
the Filipino people to draft their 
own constitution. 

“It was by virtue of this ena- 
bling aa of Congress that the Fili- 
pino people, although not yet com- 
pletely sovereign, met in convention 
to draft through their elected dele- 
gates the fundamental law of the 
land. These delegates met not by 
compulsion or fear, not under the 
pressure of war nor nvith the inter- 
ference of an invading army, but 
freely and peacefully within the or- 
derly processes of law and self-gov - 
ornment. These proccsscss started 
in 1901 when the civil government 
was established by Mr. Taft. They 
continued in 1907 when the Filipi- 
no people organized their first na- 
tional Assembly, and expanded in 
1916 with the establishment of their 
first elective Senate. Full develop- 
ment was reached in 1934 when the 
sovereign power granted to the Fi- 
lipino people formal recognition of 
their right to be independent, set 
the dale for independence and pres- 
cribed the constitutional proccsscss 
leading to it. The result of the la- 
bors of the delegates to the Consti- 
tutional Convention is the present 
Constitution of the Philippines - a 
liberal and progressive constitution, 
embodying characteristics which arc 



WORLD INFORMED OF QUEZON'S DEATH 

Severe loss to Filipinos 



OSMENA DEUVERS 
SAD NEWS 

It is with a deep sense of sorrow 
and personal loss that 1 must give 
the sad news of the passing away 
of President Manuel L. Quezon of 
the Philippines. He died in Saranac 
Lake, N.Y. at 10:00 this morning, 
with Mn. Quezon and his three 
children at his bedside. 

President Quezon’s death is a 
great loss to the freedom loving 
world. No chmapion of liberty 
fought for such a noble cause with 
more determination and against 
greater odds. His whole life was 
dedicated to the achievemenr of 
his people’s frccdoni, and it is one 
of the sad paradoxes of fate that 
with the forces of victory fast ap- 
proaching the Philippines, he should 
pass away now and be deprived of 
seeing the culmination of his la- 
bors - the freedom of his people. 

To the Filipinos, President Que- 
zon’s demise is a severe blow. No 
man has received more tokens of a 
people’s love. and confidence than 
'did Manuel L. Quezon at the hands 
of the Filipino people. His death 
will be taken in the Philippines as 
another terrible ordeal visited upon 
a nation already so sorely tried by 
a brutal invasion, and only Filipino 

responsive to the demands of the 
changing times and conditions and 
in harmony with the cxixsting civi- 
lization, traditions and ideals of the 
Filipino people. It represents the 
sovereign will of the people. Am- 
ong the outstanding features of the 
constitution arc a republican form 
of government, a bill of rights, an 
assertive legislative body, a strong 
executive and an independent ju- 
diciary. 

“The Constitution of the Com- 
monwealth of the Philippines, 
which will also be the Constitution 
of the independent Philippine Rc- 
I public, is our supreme law in peace 
and in war. Its legal validity can- 
not be successfully contested even 
with the invasion of the homeland 
by the enemy. It was for that Con- 
stitution and for the principles for 
which it stands that the heroes of 
Bataan and Corregidor and of the 
Philippines faced the enemy and de- 
fied until death its overwhelming 
power. It is that Constitution that 
is keeping alive the faith of the 
Filipino people in their complete li- 
beration and which will give the 
armed forces of victory the unstinted 
and overwhelming support of the 
people w hen our D-Day conics. 

“With the forces of freedom ad- 
vancing irresistibly on every war 
front, the enemy will soon be 
crushed. The Filipino people will 
be free again and with their free- 
will emerge triumphant and in full 
force and effect. And since this 
Constitution was made possible be- 
cause of the good faith and mag- 
nanimity of the American people, 
it stands not only as a vivid expres- 
sion of the gratitude of the Filipi- 
no nation but also as a lasting tes- 
timonial to the efficacy and suc- 
■ccss of the principles of democracy, 
liberty and justice.’’ 



courage and fortitude can blunt the 
poignant sorrow of so irreparable 
a loss. 

Manuel L. Quezon was my dear 
and beloved friend. Our friendship 
has stood the test of all political dif- 
ferences and has remained through- 
out whole and unimpaired. My at- 
tachment to him was roted in that 
genuine friendship that has mel- 
lowed with the years into a real and 
abiding affection. He has gone to 
his reward, a valiant leader <who 
will live forever in the hearts of his 
people. His memory will help me 
face the tasks that are ahead with 
the same patriotism with which he 
led Us in our fight for freedom, 
and with the same devotion to the 
masses of^ur people which has cha- 
racterized his administration as Pre- 
sident of the Philippines.

Vicc-Pres. of the Philippines 

Hospitalily lo 
People in Uniform 

To help in extending the hos- 
pitality of Xx>s Angeles to visiting 
ment and women in uniform, the 
City War Connell’s servicemen’s 
information center in Pershipg 
Sauare will soon move into newer 
and larger quarters, it is an- 
nounced. 

A special building to house the 
busy information unit is nearing 
completltloQ in the southwest cor- 
ner of the park, facing Olivo 
street, Just north of Cth Street 
Plans are being drawn up for the 
dedication of the building within 
the next few weeks. 

While temporarily accommo- 
dated in a large tent, the informa- 
tion center, staffed entirely by 

volunteer workers, has rolled up 
an impressive service record in 
the short thne since it began op- 
eration, according to Mrs. Verne 
W. McKinney, director of the City 
War Council’s volunteer office, 
who has over-all supervision of the 
bureau. 

Hundreds of servicemen and 
servicewomen every week have 
come to the center for guidance in 
finding places to sleep, entertain- 
ment, recreation, points of inter- 
est, means of transportation, and 
other helps. The servicemen had 
strange requests to make at times, 
such as asking for a place to 
take care of a pet kangaroo 
brought back from the Pacific 
war area. Many have asked about 
favorable spots from which rides 
could be thumbed back to camp. 

In Its now quarters the service- 
men’s information center will be 
able to take care of an increased 
number of uniformed visitors, and 
In addition will provide extra faci- 
lities such as a telephone room at 
which pay station calls may bo 
made to friends or relatives when 
servlcemdh hit towiL 

Los Angelos residents are asked 

to remember the location of the 
servicemen’s Information center in 

Pershing Square So that they may 
refer uniformed visitors there to 
find the answers to their ques- 
tions.

Well, here we arc again to talk 
more about our boys overseas. This

the quite and shy type — but that’s 
only in the beginning! After that- 
wcU, need •\^'C say more.^ Now for 
instance, there’s Cpl. Paul 



Tcllano - a pleasant young man of 
Filipino and .-Vn>erican heritage. Fi- 
lipino on his Father’s side and Am- 
erican on his mother’s side. Most 
of his childhood u*as spent in Ven- 
i tura, California until he moved to 
j Chicago, 111 ; which he now consid- 
i ers his stamping grounds. Believe 
j it or not, but he was the childhood 
/ ! pla)’matc of some of our Pambra 
'• ! girls. Namely, Madeline Cuizon, 
^ Caroline Alcala, and Marcclinc Ja- 
cobc. And guess what: He is 

^ not kno\s*n to these girls as Paul 
^ but as “EXilly*” an affectionate nick- 
4 name which has stuck! Now he’s 
somewhere in New Guinea with the

The Filipino Inter-Community Convention is about here. Filipino 
leaders arc in full blossom now. They are anxixous to take action that

Mr. Trinidad Rojo, the brilliant President of the CIO of Seattle is

FIGHT WITH BRAINS 

“Gone are the days when the 
Union can be run merely by physic- 
al prowess or popularity. An ideal 
president of the Union must be a 
man of brains, character, and ac- 
complishments, for he deals not on- 
ly with our members, but with high 
representatives of the employers, 
various government agencies, and 
community leaders. He must be 
able to ^)cak before meetings and 
conventions; he must be proficient 
in fact-finding, writing and organiz- 
ing his ideas into systematized pol- 
icies. He must have the perspicacity 
to grasp the problems of UCAPA- 
WA L^al 7, not only in the Seattle 
Headquarters, but also with a regio- 
nal and national perspective. 

SUCCESSFUL RECRUITING 
“Let me cite just one type qf work 



members reported that they were 
required to wait for reservations .^or 
one or two weeks. This discouraged 
many of them to come to Seattle. 

“In spite of the difficulties how- 
ever, our recruiting was regarded 
by ohn Cooler, Chief of the Food 
Administration, a division of the 
War Manpower Commission, as 
very successful. Of the 3,500 jobs in 
the Alaskan canneries, wc were able 
to fill 3,221. 

800 MORE JOBS 

Let us not forget that the jobs 
in the Alaskan canneries this year 
are 800 more than those of last 
year and that a great percentage 
of our old- members have joined the 
armed forces or arc working in in- 
dustries which pay more than the 
Salmon Industry. In the grape 
fields and in the asparagus farms, 
for instance, the boys can make 



recruiting. When wc recruited in j $25.00 a day or more.

speak in war bond drive;, programs 
and in meetings. He broadcasted 
the recruiting through the radio, 
through newspapers and through 
leaflets. He persuaded the Salmon 
industry to put advertisements on 
the screen of theatres where Philip^ 
pine films were presented. He had 
to be in constant consultation with 
X)£ficers of the War Manpower Com- 
mission, OPA, Selective Service, Bo- 
ard of Priorities, etc. in coordination 
with \Valtcr Fuehrer, Secretary of 
the Salmon Industry. He had to be 
on the alcrr, countcrohccking local 
leaders who arc opposed to our re- 
cruiting activities. 

“I can tackle the physical phase 
I of recruiting, but I can not do all 
► the interviewing, public speaking, 
I and writing needed. Even if wc can 
I . recruit the men, if wc can not get 
I their release from the U. S. Employ- 
» ment Service, and their transport- 
ation for Seattle, physical recruiting 
is useless. 

“If there were some shortcomings 
in our rccruting program, it is not 
the fault of^ President Rojo. Very 
early in the year, he presented to 
the Union an adequate and effective 
program but some leader's of th 
Union and 'the Industry failed to 
keep up With his realistic analysis 
of the situation, and the U. S. Em- 
ployment Service did not want <0

T. A. Rojo was President of the 
Union in 1939-1940. Trustee of the 
Maritime Federation of the Pacific 
in 1940-1941. Before he became Pres- 
ident of the Union, during dispatch 
ing days, there was ejisorder almost 
every day and the Union treasury 
was in the red to the tune of 
$10,000.00. His 1940- 1 94 1 administ- 
ration handed to his successor 

$13,000.00. Before T. A. Rojo en- 
tered the picture, the Union lights 
and telephone were frequently cut 
off. Due to unpaid bills and the 
Union had to pay $903.52 for un- 
paid taxes. 

Now the Union is more power- 
ful and prosperous than ever be- 
fore, with an anual income come 
of $60,000.00. It has bought with 
cash, a three smry building. 

In 1942, T. A. Rojo was Secret- 
ary of the Union, succeeding his 
friend, 1 . I. Josue. In that year the 
members, by a landslide vote of 
over two to one, again gave him 
the presidency of UCAPAWA Lo-

President Rojo was one of the 
drafters of the present constitution 
of UCAPAWA Local 7 and is pre- 
paring the new constitution of the 
Coastwise Local 7 which has bran- 
ches in Portland, Stockton and San 
Francisco. 

With such a record, it is no sur- 
prise that Donald Henderson, elo- 
quent and scholarly General Pres- 
ident of the United Cannery Agri- 
cultural, Packing and Allied Work- 
ers of America, paid T. A. Rojo a 
glowing tribute as a labor leader in 
one of his letters^ and in a speech 
delivered at a lalwr conference held 
in I^s Angeles, Feb. 5, 7 of this 
year. 

For the Union, T. R. Rojo has 
shelved his researches, studies and 
books. If the Union membership did 
not draft him for labor work, he 
would have taken a Ph. D. Degree 
several years ago; for he had finish- 
ed all credits enquired, except the 
thesis, for that high scholastic at- 
tainment. He is a member of the

tional honorary in Sociology. He is

In recent issues of the PHILIPPINE RECORD and the 
PHILIPPINES MAIL, there was published a letter addressed to 
me and signed by some members of the Federal Agricultural La- 
borers' Association (popularly known as FALA), which sought 
to inquire what happened to the organization. 

I welcomed the publication of the 



children in that vicinity.

letter because it gave me an oppor- 
tunity to explain the circumstances 
which brought about the demise of 
the union, and at the same time put 
a stop to the whispering campaign 
initiated by people who aim to dis- 
credit me. That the intent of these 
people is malicious is only too ob- 
vious. 

As I stated in my answer to the 
signers of the letter, I had written 
no the Western office of the Ame- 
ican Federation of Labor, to which 
FALA was affiliated as Local No. 
22496, referring the letter to ihem^ 
and asking them for advise. For the 
information of everyone, here 
their reply: 

San Francisco Office, 

American Federation of Labor, 
700 Golden Gate Building, 

July 6, 1944 

Mr. J. C. Dionisio, 

239 S. El Dorado St., 

Stockton, (^ifornia. 

DEAR SIR: 

I received your letter of June 19 
with enclosures on the subject of the 
FALA organization/ Your inform- 
ation to Messsn. Molo, Toval, ct al 
is generally correct. As the wokrers 
I that came under the FALA’s juris- 
diction did not sho\v sufficient in- 
terest in A. F. of L. organization 
and due to the fact that we had 
spent a considerable sum of money 
attempting to have a successful or- 
ganization functioning for the wel- 
fare of those workers, this office had 
no alternative but to withdraw the 
charter some time ago. In withdraw 
ing the charter, we also took over 
all the properties of the organization 
Therefore, at the present dmc, there 
is no FALA oiganization existing 
insofar as the American Federation 
of Labor is concerned.

A vicious rumor has been circulat- 
ed to the effect that the FALA was 
financially 'a strong organi2:atior. 



Dr. Bautista was the FALA’s pre- 
sident and continued to be its head 

until April, 1941. 

The AFL financed the FALA 
from the time of affiliation until it 
took away the charter in September 
1941, two months after I was elect- 
ed president. It sent three Filipino 
organizers into the field during the 
asparagus season of I94*> paying 
their salaries and mileage" allowances 
direct from the AFL headquarters 

in Washington. I believe that even 




when I took office as president in AFT law 

July, 1941; that it had “$8000 in t' 

the bank”, etc. This is a damnable 



lie. 



The truth is that the FALA was 
practically bankrupt when it affil- 
iated with tl'= AFL on No her , '^7 
1940. In fact, the FALA would ne- 



some $500 for services rendered by 
the attorney in fighting the FALA 
cases against the celery growers in j

Coast airframe plants by weight ' 
of complete airplanes soared from 
26,000,000 pounds In August, 1943, 
to 32,300,000 puonds for June, an 
increase of 24.23 per cent. 

In the same period, employment 
dropped from 304,000 to 245,000, a 
decrease of 19.41 per cent

In July, 1940, when the FALA

If a sufficient number of the work

matter with a committee of chose 
workers. While technically it re- 
quires only seven names to obtain 
a charter, it will be necessary, be- 
cause of the unfavorable ending of 
the first A. F. of L. FALA, that I 
be reak>nably well satisfied that a 
representative number of workers 
sincerely desire to become affiliated 
with the American Federation of

this office will cooperate to the ful-

SPEAKS DIALECTS 

In a very clever manner, he has j 
pointed out to many 'groups whom 
be met in his trip that through 
the faciliHea of a ‘ newspaper 
chain, and with the assistance . of 
the American dailies, and Ameri- 
can friends, and w'lth the tactful- 
ness and consistency of efforts, 
the time will come when most 
of the Filipinos realize the real 
value of UNITY, TOLERANCE 
and BETTER UNDERSTANDING 
among them. 

Mr. Lopez never believes in 
clanishness. • He speaks most of 
the dialects spoken of In different 
places in the Islands, and be can 
find bis place and set at ease 
among any groups — Ilocanoa, Vlsa- 
yans, Tagalogs, Moros or Igorots. 
And he can face any one, with a 
smile and reasons, of course, and 
discuss matters deliberately along 
the coures of dimplomacy and 
salesmanship. 

Before high officials, military 
or governmental, and before audi- 
ences of Americans, he can com- 
fortably bold himself, and present 
bis views on behalf of his people. 
He has been doing that for years. 
He is of Uie executive type, a 
hard working polished gentleman, 
and a very experienced traveler. 
He has traveled extensively 
throughout the principal cities of 
the United States.

Head Lettuce in the 



Fall Winter Garden 



Success with head lettuce grown 
as a fall crop depends upon the 
season and selecting the best 
planting dates, particularly in the 
interior valleys. In central and 
northern California seed this crop 

in mid-August; in southern Califor- 
nia sow in September and in Coa- 
chella and Imperial valleys sow 
in October. Leaf lettuce, 'which 
Is generally more satisfactory than 
head lettuce for home gardens, 
may be sown later. Lettuce may 
be transplanted although it is 
simpler to seed directly into the 



garden. Transplanting three to 
four inch plants into the garden 
should be done three to four 
weeks later than the above recom- 
mended seeding dates. Extended 
periods of high temperatures may 
prevent germination of lettuce 
seed. Good germination under 
such conditions may be obtained 
by placing seed in a thin layer 
between moist cloth in a refriger- 
ator for four to six days before 
planting. Keep soil moist at all 
times imtn seeds have germinated.

L eaving tomorrow for California will be Mrs. Quezon, 
widow of the Philippine President, who would prob- 
.iably be alive today if he had gone to live in Arizona. 
If he had not considered it was his sacred duty to be as 
near a 5 ^ possible to Washington, at the disposal of this 
Government. 



Reno Court 



Mrs. Quezon wants to go to 
California because the climate 
is much like that of her beloved 
islands. More important, as she 
said her- . 

self, "in 
A m erica 

it's the , 
c 1 o s est c

toward 
home." 

M a ny 
times be- 
fore her 
departure 
you could 
have seen 
her — a 
frail 
nun - like 
f igur e 
kneeling 
at her 
hus- 
band's 
tomb in 
^lington. Praying for the day 
when she and he would sail into 
Manila Bay together. For that 
is what she plans. 

How strange that the ex- 
presldent of the Philippines is 
temporarily burled In the crypt 
of the monument to the U. S. 
ship Maine. The sinking of the 
Maine In Havana harbor was 
the incident that started the 
Spanlsh-Amerlcan war . . . which 
led eventually to the United 
States taking the Philippines 
away from Spain. 

But even more unbelievable Is 
the fact that Quezon is not 
buried alone. Beside him rests 
another leader, Ignace Paderew- 
ski. ex-premler of Poland. 

There they wait ... in silence 
side by side. ..One leader from 
across the Atlantic. . .one from 
the other side of the Pacific. 



provising a little Paderewski 
burst into magnificent music . . 
Great thrUling chords, and the 
whole room was drowned in 
sound . . . One of those moments 
when the whole audience feels 
as one man ... To cheering and 
clapping the two took bows and 
with tears lit his eyes Quezon 
told Paderewski: "It has never 
been played like that before — 
it never will be again!” 



By NANCY RANDOLPH 



NEW YORK (N. Y. News) 



Oct. 27. — There was at least one 



bleeding heart In the courtroom 
when that much-married society 



beauty, Edna Mae Alexander 
Volck de Casasus Bulasky Bu- 



O VER at the Philippines Com- 
monwealth Building on 



Massachusetts Avenue when 
they hear of hilarious celebra- 
tion back home with the arrival 
of MacArthur they can't help 
automatically thinking: "It’s the 
King of Leyte! He’s putting on 
the celebration! Shouting wel- 
come louder than any of the 
others I” 

Though' they are almost sure 
"The King” was tossed in a con- 
centrMion camp by Japs they 
are more sure that "he must be 
on hand. No prison could hold 
him!” 

The story of the fabulous 
"King of Leyte" is especially in- 
teresting now . . . The last time 
that Americans were fighting in 
the Philippines, during the 
Spanlsh-Amerlcan War, the 
'chieftain Aguinaldo first helped 
Americans and then fled to the 
hills and led the insurrection 
against them. He claimed that 
Admiral Dewey had double- 
crossed him first, that the Amer- 
icans had promised freedom and 
instead wanted to take over . . . 
It took an army of 100,000 Amer- 
icans three years to hunt down 
and capture the tricky chieftain.

Her mother, as president of

en’s Clubs, 'spends a great deal

Newlyweds Plan 
Residence Here 



Planning on making tlielr 
home in Washington are Staff 
Sergt. James C. Williamson jr.. 
U. S. A., and Mrs. Williamson 
who are now on their wedding 
trip. Their marriage took place 
at the home of Mr. and Mrs. 
Harry G. Eckhardt October 18, 
with the Reverend Charles F. 
Phillips officiating. 



Fetes Group’ 



Mrs. Walter Wyatt enter- 
tained at luncheon yesterday, 
at her home on Kalmia Road, 
honoring Mrs. Palmfer Hoyt and 
Mrs. Roy A. Young of Boston, 
whose husband was formerly 
president of the Federal Reserve 
Board here. 

Others present at the fete in- 
cluded Mrs. Carl Berendsen, 
wife of the New Zealand min- 
ister; Mrs. Carter Glass, Mrs. 
D. Worth Clark. Mrs. Preston 
Delano, Mrs. Bruce Smith, Mrs. 
Henry F. Grady and Mrs. Gam- 
brill. 

Also Mrs. Clinton Tribby, 
Mrs. Seibert Stellwagen, Mrs. 
Michael Guba, Mrs. John Beat- 
ty and Mrs. A. Burks Summers. 



T he only time they ever met 
before they were laid down 
together in the same tomb on 
foreign soil was about eight 
years ago when they accidently 
crossed on the same steamer 
from ^urope to the United 
States. . .The captain of the lux- 
ury liner, tickled to have them 
both aboard, gave a "presiden 
tial dinner” to honor them. 

Afterwards the great Polish 
musician sat at the piano and 
played for the guests. Quezon 
leaned over him... “Mr. Presi- 
dent,” said Paderewski: “I’d like 
to close with your national 
anthem — but I don't know it. If 
you hum it I’ll try to pick it up." 

Shyly and shakily Quezon 
sang a few quavering notes and 
they both laughed — then Im- 






,fHEN the last gun had been 
laid down some of the U. S. 
soldiers decided to stay a while. 
. . . Some were interested in 
teaching the natives modern 
hygiene, malaria control, or 
otherwise educating them . . . 
Some stayed for adventure or 
for the pretty native girls . . . 
And many stayed to make their 
fortunes . . . like Judge Haus- 
serman who became president 
of the largest gold mine in the 
islands ... a mine which pro- 
duced more gold than any 
other under the American flag. 

But of all them the most ro- 
mantic figure is the ex-dough- 
boy, Walter Price, who became 
known as "the King of Leyte." 

From his palatial home in 
Leyte he ''ruled” benevolently 
though none the less majestl- 
callyC Immensely rich from vari- 
ous industries, married to a na- 



lasky obtained another divorce 

from Joseph Bulasky. Accord- 
ing to reports from Reno, where 
the divorce was granted a few 
days ago, Edna’s costume con- 
sisted of a white knitted sweater 
and skirt andi big drops of 
"blood” dripping down to the 
hem of the skirt. 

The costume was as dramatic 
as Edna Mae herself. 

Edna, daughter of the former 
Baroness Sasse, was married the 
first time when she became the 
third wife of Adalbert George 
Volck. That was in Montclair, 
N. J., In 1921 when Edna was 16. 
Two years later Adalbert sued 
for divorce but nothing hap- 
pened. He tried again In 1928 
and finally obtained his divorce 
a year later. 

Time passed somewhat hecti- 
cally and in 1942, Joe and Edna 
were dlvodced in Tonopah, Nev. 
Two weeks later, Joe persuaded 
her he wasn’t such a bad guy 
after all, and they were re- 
married at Las Vegas. 



tlve girl who bore him 11 chil- 
dren. he was much loved by 
all the people ... No official 
visited his “domain” in the 
Philippines from anywhere in 
the world without sitting at 
least once to a grand banquet 
at his table, which seated well 
over 100 guests comfortably . . . 
His parties In Manila were so 
lavish the whole city would 
whisper, "The King of Leyte 
has come to town! Whoop-pee! 
Champagne and all-night cele- 
bration for everybody!” ... He 
gathered guests In off the high- 
ways just for the pleasure of 
paying their checks. 



D ark-haired, six feet-uii, 
Walter Price was 225 
pounds of dynamic American 
. . . He looked like a king, lived 
like a king, and had made a 
king’s fortune in his tropical 
paradise. 

I wonder If any of our soldier 
boys will, when the liberation 
day Is here, as he did after the 
Spanish-Amerlcan War . . . stay 
on — and on — in that world 
where the dawn comes up like 
thunder . . . and the sunshines 
are almost endless. 

If we don’t make home seem 
the same happy prosperous place 
they left . . . who can blame 
them for wanting to become, 
perhaps, kings in Leyte, or even 
Brittany?

Do You Know 



Who Our First Parents 
Were and Their Status 
in Life? 



If you will read the first 
three chapters of the first 
book of the Bible, namely 
Genesis, you will find that 
God created the world in six 
days. On the first day. He 
made light; on the second, 
the firmament: on the third, 
the earth and the seas; on 
the fourth, all vegetation on 
earth; on the fifth, all ani- 
mal. bird and fish life; and 
on the seventh, man to His 
own image (G^. Ch. 1. V. 
27). To the image of God 
has reference to the soul and 
not to the body, for God Is 
an all-pure spirit. 

God likewise placed Adam 
in charge of all the works 
of creation (Gen., Ch. 1, V. 
29-30’. Later, God created 
Eve from the rib of Adam 
(Gen.. Ch. 2. 21-22) and 
gave her to him ^ a com- 
panion and a wife (Gen., 
Ch. 2. V. 24). 

Our first parents were cre- 
ated free. They had the 
freedom of tlie Garden of 
Paradise: they were to enjoy 
all its fruits except that ol 
the tree of knowledge (Gen., 
C!h. 3. V. 5). This was done 
to test their loyalty. They 
were left free to eat of this 
fruit or leave it. In a word, 
from the beginning man had 
freedom of choice. He could 
use his God-given powers to 
do God’s will or disobey. 
Why God created man this 
way we are not certain. For 
every Christian It is enough 
to know that God did so. 
God so acted. Hierefore. I 
accept His will without hesi- 
tation or doubt.

PHILIPPINE W/VR RELIEF 

This is the cause oEat every Fili- 
pino has to take an active part for 
its promotion. Let us bear in mind 
iliai this is for our folks way back 
home who have suffered one of the 
most uncivilized punishments given 
by our enemy. There is no doubt 
that since the Japanese occupation, 
t your folks and mine have been suf- 
l fering the effects of war— hunger, 
etc. They fought to the last and 
have given ail what they could for 
you and for me so that we and other 
peace loving ■ people may live the 
way we wish to be. Now, your folks 
and %ninc need our help, especially 
in the forrn of dotKing, shoes and 
food. It is reported that the Japanese 
took most of their clothing. 

^^c may ask ourselves this quest- 
ion. VVihat can I do to help my 
folks at homc.^ There arc many 
things we can do. One of them is 
to support the Philippine War Relief 
directed by Mr. Charles P. White 
r who had been Ih'ing in the Philip- 
pines since 1911. It was fortunate 
that Mr. White was here at the out 
break of die war. He was here some 
times this month to explain to us 
how the Philippine War Relief 
shou-d be done. His special trip from 
the East to the Pacific Coast shows 
Mr. WTiitc’s love for our folks at 
home. If Mr. White has an undying 
love for our folks at home, how 
much more to us Filipinos? This is 
no time to bicker and to squabble. 
Let us act at once. 

CoHcction of old clean clothes is 
now going on. We can help this 
dnvc by bringing our old dean doth 
10 a Philippine War Relief Center. 
In other words, ask the President 
of your Filipino conrmunity what 
to do with those clothes, shoes and 
Jats. Remember now, it is our obli- 
gation to sujjpori this cause. And 
when wc meet our American friends 
don't forge: to ask ohem if they 
have some old clothes which they

the celebration. 



Mrs. Quezon said further that 
this thing {the sewing of garments 
for the Philippines) must be done. 
*'Do It as a matter of charity’ she 
remarked. I \netv your hearts are 
filled for them”. 

At the end of her tall^, Mrs. Que- 
zon has appealed to cast away jeal- 
ousy to one another. She told her 
audience to forget that he or she 
is a big potato. ’’Everything, big or 

small help will count; let us co- 
operate,” she concluded.

help the war effort by making 
the most of National Rag Week. 

There are huge demands for 
Rags and paper, for packing vital 
precision equipment and high ex- 
plosives: also for w’iping-rags in 
War ihants. 

Do you know the needs in Great 
Britain are so drastic that for 
the last three years it has been 
a punishable crime to burn or 
destroy rags or paper that can 
possibly be used? We in the 
U. S. A. are reaching a crisis, 
let us tackle it in the good old 
American way. Clear out your 
cupboards and garage, bundle it 
up. If you have any other salvage 
that can be reconditioned for the 
needy, it will be acceptable. Then 
call Brigadier S. L. Cooke of the 
Salvation Armyy, MA 7775. The 
Salvation Army truck with the 
Red Shield will call.

that now, -when Americans and Fili- 
panos arc dying together in Lryte, 
is the time for Congress to act c.i 
the legislation granting citizenship 
rights to Filipinos whose loyalty to 
America has been demonstrated un- 
sparingly. 

“The whole world has been watch 
ing chc Philippinc-Amcrican experi- 
ment and many have called it a mo- 
del for postwar international rela- 
tions between nations and their colo- 
nics,” he said. “Yet, if that model 
is to succeed most affectively, cert- 
ainly the nationals of the Philippines 
must be allowed to become citizens 
of the United States, just as the na- 
tionals of America have been al- 
lowed to become citizens of the Phil- 
ippines. It is contradictory to claim 
that America accepts the Philippines 
on equal terms in the family of na- 
tions, but at the same time treats 
the Filipinos on unequal terms by 
preventing them from becoming citi- 
zens of America.

Filipinos During Commonwealth Day Celebration 



20J-W 

TTER" 

!ey, Colil, 







Wednesday. November 15 was the ninth anniversary of 
the Philippine Commonwealth For the last eight years. Com- 
monwealth Day has been one of the biggest holidays of the 

Filipinos. i 

« 

The love of patriotism and the love of country grows like 
a fountain of hope from the heart of every Filipino when this 
day comes. But as to whether or not these arc true, only we Fi- 
lipinos can supply the answer. 

Before the outbreak of the war, the Filipinos were unani- 
mously united in the form of celebration of this memorable day. 
The common form of celebration was Banquet and Ball in con- 
nection with a short program. The program only played a min- 
or pan then. 

But in the ninth anniversary of the Commonwealth, there 
were different opinions of Filipino leaders in the form of cele- 
bration. The President of a Filipino community said before the 



celebration, “We are not going to celebrate the Commonwealth 
Day with Banquet and Ball. This is no time for dancing; it is 
time to pray to the Almighty for General MacArthur’s men for 
their strength in body and soul and that victory may be soon 
achieved.’" This opinion represents one school of thought in 
the form of celebration on the ninth anniversary of the Com- 
monwealth. The said President (may be justified in his opinion 
when we come to think of our folks, relatives and friends in the 
battle fronts in the Philippines. 

Yes, it seems strange for some one to be rejoicing whea his 
brothers, sisters and parents are about to meet death because of 
the uncertainty of war. Conversely, it is also strange for us here 
not to take time out for recreation for this is the only way by 
which we can console and comfort ourselves because of our bed- 
ridden folks way back home. 

THE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN THE FORM OF 



CELEBRATION DIDN’T CREATE A DIVISION OF THE 
FILIPINOS IN THE PACIFIC COAST, BUT THE CELE- 
BRATION HAS CREATED A DIVISION OF OUR LEAD- 
ERS. For instance, in a certain community there were some who 
took the lead in arranging an affair for the celehraton of the 
ninth annversary in spite of the 'fact that there, was going to be 
one to be held within that community. Others took the passive 
attitude. WE CAN FIND THIS SITUATION IN THE 
LARGEST CITIES IN THE PACIFIC CQAST. IT IS RE- 
GRETTABLE TO SAY THAT FILIPINO LEADERS ARE 
DISUNITED IN THESE CITIES. THEY CANNOT COM- 
PROMISE FOR THE SAKE AND HONOR OF THE FILL 

% 

PINO RACE. 

FILIPINO LEADERS! OUR CQfUNTRY IS CALLING 
US. AND WHAT OUR COUNTRY NEEDS IS UNITY! 
and unity WILL CARRY US TOWARD VICTORY.

under the benevolent guidance of 
the United States when the enemy 
wantonly attacked us, interrupting 
our steady progress tow'ard ccrraplctc 
nationho^. This enemy is still on 
Philippine soil. It is thus our imme- 
diate -pairposc to destroy his power 
and to expel him from our country. 

“But it must be realized chat the 
ifbcraliqn of the Philippines is a 
joint enterprise wbich can only be 
speedily and throughly accomplished 
with the whole-hearted support of 
our people. You in your homes, in 
the towns, in the barrios, in the 
mountains, wihcthcr or not you be- 
long formally to the underground 
must do your part in accordance 
with the directives which the leaders 
of the underground and the guerri- 
llas will receive from General Mac- 
Arthur. You must do your utmost, 
as did your sons and brothers on 
Bataan and Corregidor, in Cebu 
and throughout our beloved land. 

“As the enemy is progressively 
driven out and order is restored in 
our country, so will the norma! 
funaions of civil government be 
resumed in the liberated areas. In 
my capacity as the head of the Phil- 
ippine Commonwealth I will as 
promptly and effectively as possible 
direct the restoration of the demo- 
cratic functions of government in 
the admirxistrartion of the nation, 
the provirices and the municipalities 
But I did not come back to the 
Philippines merely to sec the re- 
establishment ot the constitutional 
government which existed here be- 
fore Pearl Harbor. 

“During the time that our gov- 
ernment was compelled, by circum- 
stances, to carry on in Washington, 
first under the leadership of Pres- 
ident Quezon, and then under m'”'* 
it expanded the scope of its activities 
to include some of the prerogatives 
possessed only by independent na- 
tions. For the American Government 
did not only recognize the Common- 
wealth Government as the lawful 
govcrivmcnt of the Filipino people, 
but also gave it the consideration 
accorded to governments of coun- 
tries possessing the attributes of ab- 
solute sovereignty. 

“This more advanced govrenment 
is TJhc one which I have brought 
back to you. It is even more than 
that. Wc have the word of America 
that our country which has been 



w'ar. TTis is the independence 
"Aihich has been made possible by 
our adherence to the fundamental 
prinviplc of Filipino-Amcrican co- 
operation and which the sovereign 
prot'isions of the Tydings-McDuf- 
fic Act and subsequent legislation. 
This is the independence which was 
already w'ithin our grasp when the 
enemy invaded our soil. This is the 
independence for which the valiant 
defenders of our horrxcland — Amer- 
icans and Filipinos — fought and 
died in the Battle of the Philippines. 

“In conclusion, I wish to say that 
Just as I left Washington the Pres- 
ident of chc United States asked me 
to be the bearer of a message of 
congratulations to the Pcopic of the 
Philippines on the regaining of free 
dom and he a^ked me to give to 
you his warm and affectionate per- 
sonal regards. 



Sixth War Loan Drive 

L 08 Angeles air raid wardens 
again are being counted upon to 
assume a major role in the Sixth 
War Loan Drive, according to an 
appeal issued by Henry S. Eaton, 
the city’s chief air raid warden 
and director of war services in 
the City War Council. 

“Outstanding service was given 
by air raid wardens of this city 
in the Fifth War Loan Drive, 
more than 6,000 of these civilian 
defense volunteers working hours 
to sell millions of dollars In war 
bonds In their house-to-house sales 
sales campaign,” Eaton said. 

“Air raid wardens have the con- 
fidence of their neighbors because 
of their known devotion to the 
task of winning the war, and 
consequently they are able to at- 
tain a high degree of success 
whenever they are called upon to 
take an appeal directly into the 

people’s homes.” 

The help of these workers again 
is needed to make the forthcom- 
ing drive a success, and wardens 
are urged to contact their com- 
munity w’ardens Immediately for 
assignments In the Sixth War 
Loan campaign, Eaton stated.

and friendship. 

•T have spoken to my people, 
calling on them to give their com- 
plete and determined support to 

the anmed forces of the United 
States and to rise to the cause of 

democracy and liberty. 

"I thank you, on behalf of the 
Filipino people, for your continued 
regard for tholr welfare and free- 
dom, as conveyed in your good- 
will message, which I was privl- 

eged to give to them. You have also 
thpir deep gratitude for your 
policcy In giving to our govern- 
ent In Washington the recognition 
to which it was entitled according 
to the laws of the United States 
and under our constitution. It 
was thus possible for us to main- 
tain the exercise of sovereignty 
common to the Independent na- 
tions. Wc arc also deeply grateful 
for all the courtesies extended 

to our late President Quezon. 10 
myself and to other members of 
the Philippine Government in 
Washington. 

“With Its constitutional integ- 
rity unaffected by Japanese oc- 
cupation, the full legal authority 

of the Commonwealth Government 
is thus now ready for exorcise 
In areas freed from the enemy 
where military control Is no long- 
er required.” 

On October 20, President Roose- 
velt cabled to President Osmona 
a message of encouragement to 
the Filipino people, as follows: 

"Please deliver the following 
message to the Filipino people 
for me: 

•‘The suffering, humiliation and 
mental torture that you have en- 
dured since the barbarous, un- 
provoked and treacherous attack 
upon the Philippines nearly three 
long years ago have aroused In 
the hearts of the American people 
a righteous anger, a stern deter- 
mination to punish the guilty, and 
a fixed resolve to restore peace 
and order and decency to an 
outraged world. 

“Until we were attacked at 
Pearl Harbor we had done our 
utmost to live as friendly, self- 
respecting neighbors of the Ja- 
panese in the Pacific. 

“F'or half a century, In spite 
of signs of a decadent and mili- 
taristic Japanese leadership, we 
studiously avoided any acts that 
might provoke distrust or alarm. 
Our decency was mistaken for 
weakness. 

“Our plans for the dlgnltyy and 



only t^mporarity — brushed aside 
by 'Japanese acts of exploitation 
and enslavement. When the Ja- 
panese invaders have been driven 
out, the Philippines will take their 
place as a free and independent 
member of the family of nations. 

"On this occasion of the return 
of General MacArthur to Philip- 
pine soli with our airmen, our 
soldiers and our sailors, we renew 
our pledge. We and our Filipino 
brothers in arras — with the help 
of Almighty God — will drive out 
the Invader; we will destroy his 
power to wage war again, and we 
will restore a world of dignity 
and freedom — a world of confid- 
ence and honestyand peace.” 

President Osmena replied to 
this message of President Roose- 
velt as follows: 

“By means of leaflets and radio 
I immediately broadcast your 
message to the Filipino people 
who, by their ceaseless resistance 
to the Japanese during the dark- 
est days following the fall of 
Bataan, have shown that their 
trust in the United* States never 



w a / 

and officers and enlisted men of the 
iPihili|>pine Army, of the armed for- 
tes of the United States and of Al- 
lied nations, have continued armed 

« 

'resistance against the Imperial Jap>- 
ancse government since the sixth of 
May. 1942; Whereas this action is

October 28, 1944 

Dear J. C: 

I can very well describe to you 
how I felt w'hcn I first landed on 
the Leyte beach. But I know you 
can surmise my emotions and it is 
rchliy better that I leave it to your 
vivid imagination. All I can say is 
that 1 felt something go up and 
down my spine and every fibre of 
my being was tingling. Tears wel- 
led in my eyes as 1 saw tears in. 
the eyes of MacArthur and Osme- 
na. 

Wc waded ashore — the water 
was up to our waiste — and l .must 
take my hat off to Pres. Osmena 
Wiho walked into the water with de- 
cision and without the slightest he- 
sitancy. 'Fhis, despite a new pair of 
tan shoes that he was wearing and 
his one remaining ppir of clean 
khaki trousers. The Jap snipers were 
all around us and we could hear the 
crack of their rifle every norw« and 
then. But the moment was too preg 
nant of history for any life to be 
worth minding at that time. 

We walked through n>ud and 
over fallen trunks of trees destroyed 
hy our naval bombardment up Co 
where the Japs had made a tank 
trap. Wc were looking for the com- 
manding general of the sector, Ma- 
jor General Irving. When wc saw 
him wc returned to the htach and 
made our broadcasts from there. 
You must have heard mine. As a 
souvenir I am sending you a copy 
! as I signed and dated it on the beach 
I that historic day. Incidentally, after 
j leaving that sector, the Japs countcr- 
I attacked that evening and many 
•xasualtics were left behind. 



GLN. ROMULO DEXKIBU LANDINGS 

ihditors Note: Because of its great interest, wc are publi- 
shing the following excerpts from a letter recently received by 
J. G. Dionisio, of Stockton, Calilornia, from Brigadier General 
Garios P. Romulo, Philippine Resident Commissioner, vs^ho is 
now in Leyte battlelront. Mx. Dionisio was General Romu- 
lo s secretary during his tour of Pacific Coast Filipino communi- 
ties last April. Kelts at present secretary of the Filipino Inter- 
community Or^nization of the Western States, and Chief or 

chc Pacific Coast Bureau of BAT^AAN Magazine) .

the refugees, and willingly give 
their own rations. They treat our 
people as their ovsn, and the rela- 
tionship between the two peoples 
is heartwarming. 

It may be rather confusing to 
you, but 1 first landed with the 
troops of the 2^th division — 1 was 
in the third wave — and 27 of my 
group were killed on the beach by 
mortar shell fire. When wc had ad- 
vanced 400 yards, 1 received a mes- 
sage from General MacArthur ask- 
ing me to join him on his destroyer 
so that wc could land together with 
P/cs. Osmena. That is how 1 landed 
again for the second time with 
them — a historic occasion I would 
not have missed for anything in the 
world. 

1 am writing this to you from 
the fid.d hospital. As you must 
have read in the press, 1 was woimd 
cd on October 25th when a bomb 
c-xplodcd fifty yards from where 1 
was, killing my sentry outright and 
seven other men, including a war 
correspondent. A piece of sharpnd 
hit me on the r^ht check and lodg- 
ed itself in my ja\v. Nothing se- 
rious and I am a walking patient. 
The sharpncl was extracted the 
other day and 1 am keeping it as a 
precious momento. Cest I* guerre! 

It’s a month now since I last saw 
you and Ancn and so many things, 
have happened. From the day I 
reached HoUandia 1 underwent a 
rigorous traiumg, marching all day 
under heavy rains, fwadding in 
swamps, eating nothing but R-rat-

since ihcn__. and I must say 1 am

principles of equality, freedom and

gainst the enemy.” 

On October 23, Secretary of 
Finance Jaime Hernandez cabled 
President Osmena as follows: 

“We rejoice with you for the

can tell you the Japs have been un-

FOOD FOR THOUGHT 

A young matron entered a grocery 
in Atlanta, Ga.* The counters were 
filled with gorgeous fruits and veg- 
etables of every kind. “How much 
arc your watermelons?” she asked 
the grocer. 

“Two dollars each”, he replied. 

• “And peaches?” 

“Seventy-five cents a basket”. 

“Tlliosc lovely cherries?” 

“Eighty cents a pound.”

GREETINGS TO ALL 



In this (first) issue of the Philippines-Bataan Herald 
I wish to extend and bring to every American and Filipino 
home our sincere and warm gi*eetings. This organ of the 
Filipino residents of Keni County, Califomia, is resolved 
to a policy of unity and progress toward the achievement 
of a strong Filipino-American collaboration. 

Today more than ever before, Filipino-American 
relations have reached a new landmark where one is no 
longer a master and a servant but working on a common 
ground committed to a common purpose for a common 
good. 

America has known the Philippines for 45 years. 
Today in her height of patriotism and loyalty to the 
American Flag, the Filipino people is fighting, starving 
and dying for her national and potential salvation. The 
pages of histpry and a new history of the world will never 
forget the courage and valor of the Filipino guerillas. 

Unflinchingly they paved the way for the invasion 
of the Philippines that brought back the freedom we lost 
in Bataan in 1942. Ctener^ MacArthuris return to the 
Philippines is the fulfillment of his pledge “I SHALL 
RETURN”. 

For all that is dear to eveiy Filipino heart, Indepen- 
dence is our highest political ideal. Bataan was made the 
common soil to redeem Philippine freedom. It w^as in 
Bataan whei*e American and Filipino blood was sealed to 
save American honor and freedom. Filipinos fought and 
died because America was theii-s, and in their hearts 
Democracy must not DIE. — Ed.

. ^ Honorable John P. Fitzgerald 

no, ^QllT.'^-^, District Attorney of Santa Clara County 

San Jose, Califomia 
Dear Sir: 

This is in reply to your letter stating that an application 
has been made to you for the arrest of a native of the Philip- 
pine Islands, charpng him with holding land in California 
contrary to the Alien Property Initiative Act of 1920 (Stats. 
1921, p. LXXXiii). 

Your question is w^hether a Filipino is barred from hold- 
ing real property under that law. 

This question has never been passed upon by the courts 
of this State. The statute provides in part as follows: 

“Sec. 1. All aliens eligible to' 
citizenship under the laws of the 
United States may acquire, pos- 
sess, enjoy, use, cultivate, occupy,

transfer, transmit and inherit real 
property, or any interest therein, 
in this State, and have in whole 
or in part the beneficial use there- 
of, in the same manner and to the 
same extent as citizens of the 
United States, except as otherwise 
provided by the laws of this 
state." 

“Sec. 2. All aliens other than 
those mentioned in section one of 



and as such entitled to the pro- 
tection of the United States, ex- 
cept such as shall have elected to 
preserve their allegiance to the 
Crown of Spain, according to the 
treaty.” 

The Treaty, in Article IX, pro- 
vided that as to the natives of the 
Islands, “the civil rights and 
political status of the native in- 
habitants of the territory hereby 
ceded to the United States shall 
be determined by Congress.” 

Congress has now enacted the

The remarks mad^ by the dis- 
tinguished gentlcmdn from tlie 
City of Stockton, County of San 
Joaquin, in our Great State of 
California, in objecting to the 
Filipino Naturalization bill on 
December 4, 1944, on the floor of 
the House of Congress, needs ser- 
ious comment and careful study. 
Congressman J. Leroy Johnson, 
while he used the words “It is 
fair, I believe, to tate frankly the 
reason why I offer this objec- 
tion,' is undoubtedly evading the 
real issue of the question, as to 
whether or not citizens of the 
Commonwealth of the Philippines 
shall be permitted at this time to 
become full American citizens. 

Philippine-American Legal 
Relations 

To appreciate the significance 
of enacting this measure of na- 
turalization of such persons of the 
Philippines, I can not but briefly 
review the Philippine-American 
legal relations as a result of the 
fortunes of the Spanish-American 
War in 1896. After Spain and the 
United States ceased fighting on 
August 12, 1998, at Paris. Spain 
ceded the Philippines to America, 
and stipulated that the civil rights 
and political status of the native 
inhabitants of the territory ceded 
should be determined by Congress. 
Citizenship Defined 

On July 1, 1902, by the provi- 
sions of the first Organic Act, as 
amended, it defined the citizen- 
ship of the Filipinos, to-wit: “In- 
habitants of the Philippine Is- 
lands who were Spanish subjects 
on the 11th day of April, 1899, 
and who resided in said Islands, 
and their children bom subse- 
quent thereto, shall be deemed to 
citizens of the Philippine Islands, 
and as such entitled to the pro- 
tection of the United States.” 

The Philippines ceasing “to be

the Philippine Islands are aliens. 

The Federal courts, on several 
occasions, have had occasion to 
D 3 SS upon the alien status oi 
Filipinos. Thus, in Toyoto vs. 

United States, 268 U.S. 402, the 
court heldf in a naturalization 

case as follows: i- • 

“The citizens of the Philippine 

Islands are not aliens. They owe ... . - .

Spani.<;h”, ceased to be a foreign 
country, and as sue hcame under 
the complete and absolute sovere- 
ignty and dominion of the United 
States, and their inhabitants, us- 
ing the language of the highest 
court of the land, immediately 
upon annexation, became citizens 
of the United States, entitled to 
all the right, privileges and im- 
munities pf American citizens. 
Naturalization of Chinese 
Changed Basic Policy 

If Congressman Johnson would 
adopt the foregoing opinion of our 
Court, as a principle of law, and 
apply its interpretation to the 
status of the Filipinos who are 
American Nationals and likewise 
ore not aliens, the passage of the 
bill is not necessary. But using 
plain common sense, to protect 
the future of our children in a 
World of Peace and Brotherhood 
of Mankind, we find it imperative 
to exterminate jointly our com- 
mon enemy, the Japanese militar- 
ists. Thus, we need a change 
from 1924 in the fundamental and 
basic policy as to racial limitation 
to a world policy of racial equal- 
ity. Furthennore, Congress on 
December 17, 1943 decided to 

change this policy when an Act 
was approved making Chinese 
persons racially eligible for Amer- 
ican naturalization. 

The concensus of opinion point- 
ed to the fact that irresponsible 
talk about political differences 
resulting from racial discrimina- 
tion should be reduced to a mini- 
mum, if we intend to preserve 
American Democracy. 

Mixed Marriages 

Commenting on the statement 
that “in most” of the Western 
States where Filipinos live, they 
are not permittde to intermarry 
with members of the white race,” 
only betrays narrow-minded pre- 
judice of the worst kind, and is a 
discredit to the real principle of 
true Americanism. 

For the information of those 
unacquainted with this question, 
there are only thirteen states 
which by inference limit the free- 
dom of intermarriage between 
Malays and Whites. Of these 
states only four are Western 
States. On the other hand, we 
have thirty-five states permitting 
marriages of Filipinos with any 
race. Logically, it can not be used 
as a fundamental or basic policy 
of the American people. The 
Congressman, if I understand him 
correctly, only desires to insult 
the intelligence of the members 
of Congress. 

In truth, the real causes of all 
this irritation, may be traced to 
the exploitation by politicians and 
other office-seekers as soon as 
the controversy gives indication 
of being of sufficient importance 
for public manipulation. This is 
the cycle experienced with regard 
to the Negro, Chinese, Koreans, 
Hindus, Greeks, Mexicans and 
Japanese. 

From the time the Civil Gov- 
ernment was established in the 
Philippines in 1901, the Filpinos 
have waited over forty-four years 
for Congress to calmly deliberate 
whether or not the simple legal 
question of citizenship of these 
persons under American constitu- 
tion, who owe permanent allegi- 
ance to the United States should 
be corrected o rnot, in accordance 
with our established rules of law. 
Does the gentleman from Cali- 
fornia intend to mislead hi scol- 
leagucs in the United States House 
of Representatives or does he 
want us to wait for another forty- 
four years when World War III, 
will destroy all what we fought 
for? 

Gradual Political Autonomy 

The Filipinos since the earliest 
days of American occupation have 
requested a progressive enlarge- 
ment of their autonomy towards 
their political righto with political 
independence as the ultimate ob- 
jective and equal protection while 
they remain American wards 
where ever they may chose to

I Project 



Andrew Escalona, heading the 
drive soliciting public donations 
for the building of a Filipino 
Center in Delano, reported that 
the drive has netted $7,000.00, in 
a month campaign. The move- 
ment is under the auspices of the 
FILIPINO HOME OWNERS AND 
TAXPAYERS COMMUNITY 
COUNCIL OF KERN COUNTY, 
and is indorsed by the City and 
County officials as well as the 
different organizations of the city. 

Sheriff John Loustalout and 
District Attorney Tom Scott are 
very much pleased with the move- 
ment and have given their per- 
sonal approval. The site of the 
future home is located on the west 
side of Glenwood Street at Cecil 
Avenue and has an acreage of 
1 9/10 acres. The site was 
bought by Andrew Escalona from 
Sam Underhill at the price of 
$2,750.00. 

The building when finished will 
have a complete recreational 
facilities, play^ounds and swim- 
ming pool. It will be one of the 
citys finest. The building will be 
under the care of a Board of 
Trustees, to be elected from Fili- 
pino citizenry and from the Amer- 
ican group. Judge L. Pryor of 
Delano, is an active campaigner 
assisting Escalona, and has con- 
tacted the House Palnning Com- 
mission in Bakersfield for the 
blue print and other things neces- 
sary for the building.

recommended a Professor of the 
Berkeley University of Califomia 
campus to deliver the day’s vali-

A free for all dancing will be 
held at the Veteran’s of Foreign

President Osmena 
Favers Early 
Independence 

As the liberation of the Philip- 
pines is practically assured. Presi- 
dent Sergio Osmena and other 
Filipino leaders are anxious to 
see Independence granted earlier 
as provided in the McDuffie- 
Tydings Law. The original date 
for granting Philippine Freedom 
is set on July 4th, 1946. 

'True, there are a few more re- 
maining Japs in the islands which 
stands on the way for an early 
independence. But I think it is 
a matter of a little time to clean 
them up. And soon as this is 
done I can see no reason why 
Philippine Independence will not 
be granted earlier than 1946, 
President Osmena said. And if 
it will be granted I hope it will 
be next August, because it was 
in August 1898, when the United 
States took over the Philippines 
from Spain. 

And in so doing, America is 
keeping her good faith to the Fili- 
pino people and to all Asiatics. 
Because as far as the Filipino 
people is concerned they are the 
only people who have accepted 
the white man’s rule in the Orient 
— to the end that freedom and 
Independence as promised them 
from time to time is their to have 
and for America to give. Let us 
all get behind President Osmena. 

General Romulo and 




Family Reunited 
In Philippines 

Authoritative reports has reach- 
ed here today that General Carlos 
P. Romulo, Resident Commission- 
er of the Philippines to the United 
.States and his family has been 
re-umted. It was on Christmas 
eve of 1941, when he left his 
family under orders from General 
MacArthur, to assume his duties 
on the Voice of Freedom. 

His wife, Virginia, a former 
Miss Philippines of the Philippine 
Carnival and his three sons were 
rescued from behind Japanese 
lines by airplane somewhere in 
Luzon. Carlos Jr., 18, a lieuten- 
ant and veteran of Bataan, guided 
160 guerillas through two Jap- 
anese strongholds to save the 
family. (Cent, o n Page 3, col. 3) 

Aguinaldo Held by

From reliable sources it is re- 
ported that General Emilio Agui-

Philippine insurrection during the 
Spanish-American War and Presi- 
dent of the erstwhile Philippine 
Republic is now being held cap- 
tive by American military auth- 
orities in the Philippines. 

The General is pro-Japanese

Philippine Day in Delano 

Delano has desi^ated April 8th Philippine Day. 

This is a most fitting tribute and honor for the recap- 
ture of Manila from the Japanese by General MacArthur, 
and the advancing liberation of the entire archepielago. 
Filipinos and Americans alike share than honor and the glory 
of America’s fulfillment to liberate the Filipino people. 

The hour of our victoiy has come. Today Manila is 
free — liberated — church bells are ringing once again, herald- 
ing to mankind Filipino faith in God and in Ameri 9 a. Schools 
are re-opened, the stores, the theatres, streets, the famed 
Taft and Rizal Avenues, the beautiful Luneta are again open 
emporiums of happy association without Japanese sentries 
watching around. 

Yes — Manila — the happy and beautiful city — 
capital o fthe Philippines flies again the “Olr Gloiy” the 
symbol of Freedom and Democracy. 

Delano and Kern County salutes that fair city, the host 
of the Orient, and its bi-ave, gallant defender and protector 
General Douglas MacArthur. 



Johnson on Filipino Naturalization 

BY ANTONIO GONZALES 
Pres. Filipino Inter-Community of Western States 

For the second time the Committee on Naturalization 
and Immigration has recommended by a unanimous vote of 
its membei*s the favorable consideration of the H. R. 776, 
otherwise known as the McGehee Bill, which authorizes the 

naturalization of Filipinos in Hawaii and the United States. 

\^en the said bill was first presented last December 
fourth, Congressman J. Leroy Johnson objected to its con-j 
sideration by unanimous consent on the gi’ounds that, first, 
the Filipinos beling to a race which cannot be assimilated, ^ 
and that, second, this naturalization issue should await the 
termination of the present world war. | 

It is a matter of record that Congressman Johnson work- 
ed and voted for the Congi*essional act granting naturaliza- 
tion rights to Chinese. Does the Congressman consider the 
Chinese more assimilable than the Filipinos ? Why does, Mr. 
Johnson consider the Filipino less worthy of American citi- 
zenship than the Chinese, Congi*essman Johnson did not 
wait until after the present conflict when he voted for the 
Chinese naturalization bill a year ago. Why should he want 
to postpone a similar bill for Filipinos. Since he thought it 
wise, just, and propitious that the Chinese should be granted 
their plea for justice, why deny the same to Filipinos? 
American principles of fair play should imp>el Mr. Johnson 
to revise his attitude toward the pending bill for the naturali- 
zation of Filipinos. 

It is a source of relief to know that, for the most part, 
Congress is constituted of men of vision and liberal ideas. 
To such membei*s of Confess Filipinos in the United States 
appeal their case for citizenship, confident in the thought 
that whatever their verdict may be, it will be predicated upon 
justice and equality.

new venture.” 

Editor Rosario said — '‘As one of the many fine educated 
Filipinos in this country that I have the honor to know I am

On February 14th last the House Committee on Imniigra- 
tion and Naturalization met to consider the follo\ving bills to 
naturalize Filipinos. 

H. R. — 542, by Congressman Randolph, of West Virginia. 

H. R. — 768, by Congressman Sheppard, of California. 

H. R. — ^776, by Congressman McGehee, of Mississippi. 

H. R. — 1744, by Congressman Pow’^ell Jr. of New York. 

H. R. — 2112, by Delegate Farrington of Hawaii. 

The Committee decided to recommend the McGehee Bill 
(H.R. 776) which from the office of the Committee Chair- 
man on Immigration and Naturalization, Congressman Dicik- 
stien, has informed the Resident Commissioner of the Philip- 
pines to the United States in Washington, that the Commit- 
tee had unanimously decided to have the bill placed on the 
consent calendar, which is likely that the bill \vill be brought 
before the floor of the House for action, on or about Mai*ch 5. 

The McGehee Bill II. R. 776, which was introduced by 
Congi’essman McGehee of Mississippi, in the House of Re- 
presentatives on January 4, 1945, were as follows : 

A BILL 

To authorize the naturalization of Filipinos. 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa- 
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

follows : 

SEC. 303, of such Act is hereby amended to read as 
follows. 

Sec. 303 — ^The right to become a naturalized citizen un- 
der the provisions of this Act, shall extend only to white per- 
sons, persons of African nativity or descent, descendants of 
races indigenous to the Western Hemisphere. Chinese per- 
sons, or persons of Chinese descent and Filipino persons or 
persons of Filipino descent. Provided that "nothing in^ this 
section shall prevent the naturalization of former citizens 
of the United States^ who are otherwise eligible to naturali- 
zation under the provisions of section 317. 

SEC. 2 — The Nationality Act of 1940, (54 Stat. 1137 ;) 
(8 U. S. C. 907) is hereby amended by adding a new section 
to be known as “Sec. 321 A” and to read as follows : Sec. 321 

A Ortificates of arrival or declarations of intentions shall 

not be required of Filipino persons or persons of Filipino de- 
scent who are citizens of the Commonwealth of the Philip- 
pines on the date of the enactment of this section, and who 
entered the United States prior to May 1st, 1934, and have 
since continously resided in the United States. The term 
“Filipino persons or persons of Filipino descent” as used in 
this Act shall mean persons of a race indigenous to the Philip- 
pine Islands and shall not include persons who are of such one 
half of a race ineligible to citizenship.

Part of the problem involves 
the necessity of recruiting large 
numbers of workers at distant 
points who arrive in Seattle in 
large groups and have to secure 
board and room under difficult 
conditions for a period of several 
days before embarkation. This 
delay before embarkation Is 
caused by the necessity of clear-;

agencies and dispatching them

be unwise to advise any Filipino 
that he would be secure in his

that, since aliens only are refer-

and since the Nationality Code 
classifies Filipinos as nationals 
and says expressly that they are 
not aliens, were the matter now 
to be submitted to the courts of

Unbroken Flllpino- 
American Friendship 



Speaking as to “any doubt about 
Filipino-American friendship, let 
me quote the late President 
Manuel L. Quezon, when he Mid: 
“What America did in the Phili- 
pines in time of Peace has repaid 
her well in her hour of peril and 
in terms of the esteem and respect 
of aU mankind. I speak for the

ployee in his final settlement. 

7. In consideration of the 
agreement herein contained, it is 
understood that no further re- 
quests will be made by the Union 
for transportation between Seattle 
and other points in the United 
States, and the Union hereby 
agrees to withdraw this question 
from the 1944 proceedings before 
the War Labor Board. 

It is therefore agreed that the 
existing contract between the 
Union and the Industry, with the 
amendments provided herein, will 
be the 1945 agreement. 

This agreement will not pre- 
clude either party from bringing 



people of the Philippines when 1 1 up for discussion at any time any

America's honorable and high- purpose of obtaining mutual

An eyewitness to the activities 
of General Romulo who was pre- 
sent at the conference was Manuel 
P. Manahan, young newspaperman 
from Manila. According to him. 
General Romulo was frequently 
seen walking among the ruins of 
the dead city of Manila. “I was

Stefan, “as well as our material 
support, goes out to these bands 
of heroes fighting grimly and 
efficiently in the cause of libera- 
tion.”

and a West Coast publication- 
Insigne’s “close” friends are sit- 
ting on a powder keg, waiting and 
watching his fidgety fingers which 
are itching for a gun or a type, 
writer. They claim that if In. 
signe chooses the typewriter, then 
we wUl certainly /be informed of 
the Dr. Jekylls and Mr. Hydes of 
our Philippine Government and 
some West Coast moguls. 

And speaking of Manuel In- 
signe and our Philippine Govern- 
ment, a thought provoking query 
came to our desk the other day. 
“Is Manuel Insigne WORKING 
for the Philippine Government?” 
(P. S. Mr. Printer, please see to 
it that you bold and capitalize 
the word, “working” wito the 
quotation ; marks.) 

Delano: Mrs. Manuel L. Quezon, 
the wife of our late president re- 
vealed during an informal gather- 
ing of leading Filipino newspaper- 
men of the West Coast that while 
her late husband was far from 
death, his supposed close friends . 
had long formed a government of 
their own. On which a newsman • 
asked, “What close friends the . 
late president had?” 

Manila: Reports are that the 

reconstruction of Manila has be-,J 
gan and that a leading Filipino ! 
capitalist, who now resides in ^n^ | 
Francisco, and some American 
businessmen are behind it Ac- 
cording to some reliable sources 
there had been some bloody 
clashes and strikes between the 
employees and the employers due 
to low wages. The natives were 
only receiving fifty centavos a 
day without meals or rooms. The 
strike was instigated by Filipinos 
who came from America who in- 
formed toe natives of the hi^ 
wages here. 

San Francisco: One of toe most 
interesting subjects of discussion 
going on among the so called men- 
about-toe-communities is how a 
certain government renresenta- 
tive obtained his post. Accordi^ 
to a well-inform^ friend of his, 
the position given to him is a 
token of appreciation for being a 
good boy to a certain army officer 
whom he entertained deluxe. To 
explain what I mean by the word, 
“Deluxe”, would be revealing the 
obvious. 

Hollywood: At a recent strike of 
the Filipino Screen Players for 
higher wages, a scabbing Flliplna 
extra from Stockton, who thinks 
she is cute, was chased throu^ 
toe picket line by another angry 
woman extra. Reports say she 
escaped from hair pulling by a 
fraction of a second. Hm!? that 
would have been som’m. 

t 

San Francisco: This is the 

story of Pedro Carpio, recently 
nurse on the SS Mactan who help- 
ed evacuate wounded soldiers to 
Australia and risked his life in 
helping the needy and went 
through bombings. He landed in 
San Francisco, worked for a while 
and became sick and destitute. 
He asked for help from the gov- 
ernment he served well. At first 
for a chance on a job that might 
take him back to the Philippines. 
No dice! Then his ailment be- 
came so acute that he needed an 
emergency operation. He went 
to the hospital and came out 
penniless. Went for emergency 
help at the Western Division. Up 
to the present he has received no 
help. The powers that be are still 
rocking themselves to sleep wait- 
ing for Father Nature to take its 
course while the poor fellow who 
served humanity and country w^, 
that they in the Philippine Gov- 
ernment can continue to sit pretty 
and comfortable remain suffering 
from pain and disappointmenL 
Now I ask: Is it red tape, or is 
this the kind of government he 
served? 

This is our Philippine delegation 
in San Francisco— 

Somebody in the Western Divi- 
sion Office was bawled out for 
reasons he did not know. Accord- 
ing to news gathered, our Little 
General arrived at the station 
from Washington and expected a 
big delegation from Filipinos of 
the West Coast. But to his dis- 
appointment, only a military 
escort was there to meet him. His 
representative thought all the 
general’s movement were strictly 
military secret SSSSSH and can’t 
be revealed. And that includes 
his presence at toe San Francisco 
Conference. Oh, Dear! 

One of the most puzzling moves 
of our Government and its dele- 
gation to the conference was the 
appointment of Major Jesus Vil- 
lamor, our well liked Filipino air 
hero as technical adviser to the 
delegation — you know? — he can 
only be seen but not heard. And 
his name does not appear in the 
official list and in the releases 
from the Philippine Common- 
wealth. Why is he isolated from 
the rest of the delegations? The 
Major is at the Stewart Hotel 
while the rest are at the Saint 
Francis. 

And think this over — 

That what you are is a concoc^ 
tion of what your friends, critics, 
enemies, and acquaintances say 
behind you.

Yap Organizes 

Citizenship 

(ommitlee 



WASHINGTON — In response 
to repeated requests and an over- 
whelming desire of Filipinos for 
immediate consideration of the 

Filipino Naturalization Bill now 
pending in Congress, Dr. Diosdado 
Yap, editor and publisher of 
Bataan Magazine, formed a Fili- 
pino Citizenship Committee here 
after consulting with various Fili- 
pino organizations throughout the 
United States, Alaska, and Hawaii. 

In a circular addressed to all 
Filipinos, Dr. Yap said that “the 
time is propitious for the im- 
mediate consideration of this 
legislation now that Uiere is an 
overwhelming sympathetic inter- 
est on the part of the American 
people towards the Filipinos whose 
loyalty has gained the universal 



adminration of the entire world.” 

The committee will serve volun- 
tarily, according to Dr. Yap, but 
it should be understood that it 
must work out its program with 
the unqualified endorsement of 
both the Philippine Government \ 
and the Office of the Resident 
Commissioner of the Philippines to 
the United States. 

In his appeal for support, fin- 
ancial or otherwise, the chairman. 
Dr. Yap, has assured every Fili- 
pino “that a full and complete 
accounting of all expenses will be 
made and complete report sub- 
mitted to all those who have co- 
operated in this drive.”

“The racial state must not con- 
cern itself with the interests of 
other states, but must battle for 
its own people. The future will 
not be guided by international

Wondering 



SAN FRANCISCO — Many of 
this city’s prominent Filipino re- 
sidents have been wondering 
whatever happens to cash contri- 
butions to Philippine war relief. 
Captain and Mrs. Mariano Sulit 
have also been wondering. They 
were responsible recently for 
sending to the Philippine War Re- 
vlief in Washington proceeds from 
'the Manila liberation banquet 
held at the Fairmont Hotel. It is 
reported that no acknowledge- 
ment has been received. 

It has been explained by some 
that the failure of parties con- 
cerned to acknowledge receipt of 
the donation was due to heavy 
work and lack of time. Critics, 
A lieutenant at Fort Dix, New however, pointed out that it is

of Randall’s Nigh Club missed 
fifty dollars from the till one ! 
morning. Acting on clues fur- 
nished by others who noticed some 
youths loitering there the night, 
before, the money was traced to a ' 
garage owned by the father of 
one of the boys. Juvenile auth- 
orities have taken the youths into 
custody. 

Older Filipino residents here ' 
have express^ grave concern over 
the fact, and a movement has been 
initiated to prevent more juvenile 
delinquency. The problem, ac- 
cording to them, is providing our 
youths with plenty of wholesome 
recreation. Persuading those who 
have left school to go back is an- 
other of the many problems, and 
city authorities here have been 
asked to coooerate. 



Editor Heeds 
Salmon Call 



Each year salmon clog up the 
rivers of the Pacific Northwest 
when they go against the current 
to spawn. They soon die, if they 
are not fished out of the rivers 
by Indian fishermen. Their eggs 
laid, a generation of salmon soon 
follows. These are the young that 
grow into more salmon which will 
roam the waters of Alaska and 
Siberia. They are the reason for 
the annual migration of fish can- 
nery workers to those same reg- 
ions. And Editor G. Rey Reynes 
is one of them. 

For the length of the Alaska 
salmon season, the readers of this 
paper will miss the vigorous pen 
of Editor Reynes. He left De- 
lano on May 5, but he promised 
to tell us how King Sahnon be- 
haves. We will yet read the com- 
plete story of King Salmon.

STOCKTON — The Wednesday 
night sewing group under the 
supervision of Mrs. Katherine 
Legare, president of the Fllipino- 
American Literary Club, is on the 
job at the Community headquar- 
ters, 222 S. El Dorado Street, as 
usual. ’The women meet there 
to sort and pack used clothing 
which is eventually sent to the 
Philippines. The boys who come 
along as escorts are put to work 
tying up the boxes. 

'Their record for this month is 
40 cartons packed, tied and label- 
ed for the San Francisco office 
where it is baled and loaded on 
Army transports destined for a 
port in the Philippines where 
needy civilians will benefit by 
the work of our industrious boys 
and girls. 

A few days ago a shipment was 
received of new material which is 
to be sewed into dresses for girls 
from 6 to 12 years old. Volunteer 
sewers are needed to help the 
group already working so that 
these garments can be finished 
as soon as possible. ' 

Members of the Wednesday 
night group are Mrs. Suzana Man- 
grobang. Miss Angel Bantillo, Miss 
Norma Bantillo, Miss Eleanor' 
Baldevia, Miss Leatrice Bantillo, |

Mr. Jerry Paular, Mr. Ray Paulari 
and Paul Paular. Mr. Bacaloy, ' 
who is in charge of the hall, acts 
an host and provides fruit and 
cookies for the tired workers. 
Mrs. A. Gonzalez, the secretary, 
of the Women's sewing group, 
keeps the records of the wprk 
done and sends a monthly report

Visitor here recently was 
Jose C. Kscalona. brother of A. 
C. Escalona, who came back from 
the Philippines after several en- 
gagements of his unit with the 
enemy. Joe is a chief steward in 
the United States Navy. 

While in the Philippines he tried 
his best to contact his family in 
Numancia, Capiz, but without 
success. The several stars on his 
campaign ribbons indicate the 
number of engagements he had 
been in. 

In Philippine waters, he partici- 
pated in the landings at Lingayen 
Gulf, at Olongapo, and finally in 
Manila during the mop up of the 
Japanese in the Walled City. 

He was here only two days, 
and stayed at his brother’s house. 
He also came here to look over 
the business enterprises he left 
behind when he went away to. 

join the navy. | 

He was surprised to find the 
resident Filipinos here organized 
into the Home Owners and Tax- 
payers Community Council. He 
was especially glad to learn of 
the projected building of a center. 
He had a grand visit with his 
friends, and when he went away 
again, they bade good luck and 
success in the wars.

Concern here over the lack of

pines has been expressed, and it 
has also been planned that a 
special drive for medical supplieo

WASHINGTON — A $10,154.39 
check representing contributions 
from 590 individuals and 26 small 
business firms of the Filipino com- 
munity of Waipahu, Territory of 
Hawaii, was accepted recently by 
Jaime Hernandez, Secretary of 
Finance of the Philippine Com- 
monwealth, on behalf of President 
Sergio Osmena. The money is to 
be used at Fh-esident Osmena’s dis- 
cretion for Philippine war relief. 

Virtually all the contributions 
were from workers of the Oahu 
Sugar Co., and ranged from $1 to 
$50. Ernest W. Greene, vice pre- 
sident of the Hawaiian Sugar 
Planters’ Association, made the 
presentation at the Philippine 
Commonwealth Office in Wash- 
in^n. The check was forward- 
^ to him from Hawaii. 

In an accompanying letter to 
President Osmena, who was at 
that time absent from Washing- 
ton, David M. Cayetano, chair- 1 
man of the fund-raising commit- 
tee, said, “The Filipino commun- 
ity realizes that at this hour, even 
when the Philippines is still in 
the process of being liberated by 
the gallant forces of General 
Douglas MacArthur, help is need- 
ed and will be needed even more 
greatly when the last Jap invader 
is finally driven out of the Philip- 
pines.” , , „ . 

The letter asked the President 

“to accept our unshakable and un- 
divided loyalty and our complete 
confidence in your leadership. ’ 

Other members of the commit- 
.tee included Rosendo Marchan, 
Alfong Olivares and Lauro Pasay. 



SAN FRANCISCO — Only Fili- 
pino to represent her group in the 
Civic Unity Council of this city

Sulit will also represent her group 
at the function at the Mark Hop- 
kins on May 26 in honor of the 
only woman delegate of the Uni- 
t^ States to the UNCIO. 

It has been the comment in 
some Qusrters here that Mrs. Sulit 
is the best qualified of her sex 
among her group because of her 
intellectual attainment. In spite 
of some objection in rival 
ters, she has proved her mettle 
as a lecturer, a worthy representa- 
tive of her nation.

Fred Fertig, its former editor, was 
responsible for its excellent edi- 
torial content. ^ * 

The present editor is a literary

WHY CAN'T THE QUEZONS 

GO HOME? 

I think 1 express the sentiment 
every Filipino, when I. say that almost 
everyone would like to pro home if 
given the priority to board any ship 
going: to Manila. And that. I believe, 
goes too, also for the Quezon family, 
who had expressed their heart-felt 
desire- to return home to Manila, 
shortly after the recapture of that 
city from the Japs. 

From those who know the real situa- 
tion inside Manila, life in the liber- 
ated city is now free from turmoil. 
Everywhere life is coming back to 
normal and business t?stablishments 
are doing business as usual. 

Why the Quezons are still in Los 
Angeles, not that we don’t like them 
hare, is a matter of speculation and 
CMttjerture. At heart, we believe in 
contributing to the happiness and 
welfare of the Quezons while they 
are in our community. We have no 
pFudge against them, although some 
of our people might still have some 
negative opinion and sentiment over 
the indifference of the late President 
Quezon. 

It looks like the Quezons are 
"frozen” into staying in America 
for some political rea.sons. Perhaps, 
if is feared that their presence in 
Manila might bring about some pol- 
itical influence and repercussions in 
the present political set-up in the 
Philippines. Of course, the Quezons 
must be in the "know” that some- 
thing has been going on which will 
influence future political develop- 
ment in the Philippines. Hence, their 
presence in Manila is being dis- 
couraged and frozen in America un- 
der the pretext that Manila is not 
yet safe for civilians. 

The Quezons will be welcome in 
Manila. I hope they can go home 
soon. There is no place, in all the 
world like home. . . And to them, 
there is no home, but in Manila, s/ 

WHAT'S WRONG WITH FILIPINO 
NEWSPAPERS? 

One evening at the office, Mr. 
Gene Rezos, aeronautical engineer 
for Che Vultee -Aircraft Corporation 
and 2nd Class Yoeman Dioscoro I.. 
'TnianHno, farmer c or orient for 
the GRAPHIC and j-ours truly, came 
to talking on what’s wrong with Fi- 
lipino newspapers. It was an inter- 
esting and pleasant bull scsion. 

With the critical and analytical 
mind of an engineer, Mr. Rezos 
spoke in soft, measured tones of 
what he thought was wrong with Fi- 
lipino newspapers. Fundamentally, 
he blamed the nature of Filipinos as 
the basic cause of the shortcomings 
of Filipino newspapers. In his simple 
words he said: "They try to knock 
one another.” And he ascribed the 

jealousy. Evidently, what

THE TYDINGS COMMITTEE AND 
THE FUTURE OF THE PHILIPPINES 

By M. H. GOLDNER 

Departure of the Philippine Rehabilitation Committee 
headed by Senator Millard E. Tydings for the Philippines to 
make a study of the needs of the Islands, together with that 
of President Sergio Osmeha with the announcement that the 
machinery will be placed into operation for a national election 
places the archipelago in the political and economic limelight 
at a time when the complete freedom from Jap domination 
is nearing completion by the United States army under the 
direction of General Douglas MacArthur. 

The Tydings Committe and their 
ultimate findings and recommenda- 
tions are of ^the utmost importance

In his first press conference, since

Jealousy is not basically the cause 
of it. There are .so many other fact- 
or.s to be considered. First, there is 
the kinds of Filipino new.spaper3, 
which are reflections of the person- 
ality and ambitions of their editor.'^ 
and publishers. Some meant for 
money making purposes, are more 
or less adveftising mediums in their 
make-up and they absolutely refrain 
^from taking issues on some contro- 
versial problems of the community. 
They don’t want to hurt anybody, be- 
cause they want to appease every-

There are another publications

striking example is that of our

protection of the bases.

of naval and military bases, the 
adjustment of tariffs and the amount

of the report. 

The election of a president, vice- 
president and a new assembly to 
carry out the vast post war rebuild-

FROSS CASE 



According to a press release issued by General Carlos P. 
Romulo, Resident Commissioner of the Philippines to the 
United States, the California State Supreme Court yesterday 
unanimously upheld a superior court ruling that Filipinos are 
not aliens and therefore are not prohibited from acquiring and 
possessing land in this state. The opinion was written by Just- 
ice J. Shenck. 

The Supreme Court ruled: “The

The decision was hailed by Fili- 
pinos in Califordnia v^ho have here-

real property in the state by arbi- 
trary interpretations of the state 
Alien Land Law which bars aliens 
ineligible to citizenship from ac-

In many cases the law imposed 
hardships on Filipino farmers who 
were refused leases on farm lands.

Commander ha§ granted permission 
for such ships to discharge cargo 
at Philippine ports. At a conference 
Secretary Hernandez had with of-

was discussed and the first ship for 
the Philippines to carry civilian re- 
lief under the auspees of the Com-

proximately 8,000 tons of cargo will

Secretary Jaime ' Hernandez in ckarse of the Commonwealth Govern- 
ment in Washington in the absence of President Sergio Osmena who is 
now in the Philippines, issued the following statement todav on the death 
of Joseph Ralston Hayden: 



“I am deeply grieved at the pas- 
sing of Dr. Hayden. As Vice-Gover- 
nor General and Secretary of Public 
Instruction, and for some time Act- 
ing Governor General of the Philip- 
pines, he performed his duties well 
and nobly as those of us who as- 
sociated with him can well remem- 
ber. His books on the Philippines 
are known to many. Dr. Hayden 
has never actually ceased working 
for the Philippines. In the War 
Department he worked for the Phil- 
ippines. ,When he was released on 
May 17, 1945, he became special as- 
sistant tq President Osmena. Dr. 
Hayden landed with the liberating 



forces on Leyte and from there 

* 

continued the work he had started 
in Washington and, earlier, in the 
Philippines. At the time of his death, 
he was deep in the problem of re- 
habilitation of the Philippines. His 
untimely death had put a stop to a 
life of continuous service for our 
country. 

Filipinos who knew him, from 
President Osmena down to the 
common man, who had read him and 
profited by his labor, grieve at his 
untimely death. His books and hit 
works will keep the memory of him 
long in the minds of the people of 
the Philippines.”

CHURCH OF ENGLAND MOVES 
TO ALLOW IN-LAW MARRIAGES 



LONDON, May 17. — The propos- 
als to ease restrictions on marriages 
of certain-in-law relatives was ap- 
roved yesterday by the Church of 
Englands’s Lower Hou;se of Convo- 
cation of Canterbury. 

The upper house was informed 
by the Archbishop of Canterbury 
of the proposition which would give 
sanction for a man to wed his sister- 
in-law or a niece-in-law, and for 
a woman to marry a nephew-in- law. 
The proposals, entailing a revision 
of the table of kindred and affinity 
in the book of common prayer, were 
oposed by Canon C. E. M. Fry of 



Oxford, who said, he thought it 

“very wrong to withdraw the pro- 
hibition about a deceased wife’s 
sister.” 

“A great many of us,”- he said, 
“konw of cases where the wife 
grows old rather faster than her 
husband. She becomes rather faded. 

“Her husband is not a had sort 
of man, but he is amorous. His wife 
has a younger attractive sister. He 
likes to go for long walks with 
her and his wife becomes uneasy 
about the friendship. Is 
while to bring discord 
family ?” 



the representatives of two peoples 
dedicated to the perpetuation of the 
ideal of freedom and democracy is, 
in itself, an occasion of significance. 
But to have such an event take 
place in this City of Brotherly Love 
which is also the cradle of free go- 
vernment, heightens its meaning and 
solemnity. 



Forge, America’s Calvary, I speak 
with a full heart, since Americans 
an Filipinos suffered together on 
Bataan, the Calvary of my home- 
land. There, as elsewhere, our two 
peoples made it clear that we prefer 
death to slavery. Filipinos gave their 
lives that Americans may live. Bound 
by the ties of a true brotherhood, 



Americans and Filipinos will carry

in a free America. It was here where 
patriotic Americans gathered and 
j drew up the Declaration of Indep- 
endence, that immortal document 
which is the charter of freedom not 
only for Americans but for all men 
everywhere. 

“I have come to Philadelphia as 
a representative of a people who, 
like your patriots of 1776, fought 
and sacrificed for the democratic 
ideals which are sacred to you. In

the deep understanding and friend-

the American flag, the Filipino flag 
has its red, white and blue for pa- 
triotism and fortitude. On the White 
triangle of equal sides are three 
stars, representing the three main 
geographic divisions of the Philip- 
pines: Luzon, Vizuya and Mindanao. 
There is also a sun, symbolic of hope, 
with eight rays, which represent the 
first provinces which revolted ag- 
ainst Spain. Ordinarily, the blue is 
above the red, hut, you see it now, 
the red is above the blue because

WITH DELANO FRIENDS 



DELANO, May 24 (Philippine 
Press Alliance) — Twenty seven 

months of campaigning in the Pa- 
cific Southwest, including participa- 
tion in the invasion of Okinawa, is 
the recorJ of Steward First Class Max 
Texton, now on furlough, and visit- 
ing his old friends in Delano. Six 
stars on his campaign ribbon de- 
notes the six naval engagements of 
his unit against the enemy. 

Steward Texton related the story 
of how a group of Kamezake planes 
— Japanese dive bombers^ — suddenly 
came out of the sun and attacked 
their formation. It was tough going, 
according to him, but they made 
Okinawa. 

He was also with his unit when 
the liberation forces under General 
Douglas MacArthur invaded Leyte. 
Later he participated in the landings 
at Lingayen. 

Asked about the condition of the 
people in the Philippines, he said 
that they are hard up for food and 
clothing. Rice planting, according 
to him, was rather late, and the peo- 
ple have been eating camote tubers 
and leaves. In many instances, the 
people have learned to bake bread 
from flour given by G.I.’s in im- 
provised 5-gallon cans which srerved 
as ovens.

A NEW LEASE 

ON FILIPINO LIFE 



I 

IS THE FILIPINO INTER- 
COMMUNITY ORGANIZA- 
TIONS OF THE WESTERN 
STATES, KNOWN AS THE 
FICOWS, NECESSARY? 

Having been a delegate to 
its conventions several times 
and having seen its past per- 
formances, 1 take the apposite 



ebrated 

Filipino, to own land in the .late of California. • 

It ha. also clarified the political .tatu. of Filipino, a. national, of 
iJie United States. Otherwise, the misinformed people, of this state might 
still misconstrue Filipino nationals for “aliens," 

For more than two decades, Filipino agricultural workers have been 
the scapegoats in clearing the fields, irrigating the wastelands, planting 
the crops and harvesting the products over all the farms from Salinas Val- 
ley to the Imocrial Valley, 

Filipino farmers and farm hands^ who were youthful immigrants to 

• . . 

this promised Ibnd, had given the best parts of their lives in building ; vicw. I SUbmit thnt thc Gxist" 
California as America*, agricultural empire. During Ibe course of twenty j Qf FICOWS is nOt 

years, the labor and sacrifices of Filipino agricultural workers were not j nCCeSSary. The following are 
recognized. j-easons. Howevei* take a 

It was because of the discrimination and prejudices of capitalistic 
pressure groups. Instead, the credit was given to the Japanese farmers, who 
were smart as usual, for capitalizing on Filipino labor. 

m 

The sad part is that, even the Filipino Farm Contractors, who were 
the middlemen between the Associated Farmers and the Filipino farm 
workers, wore in cahoots in selling the birthright of our unorganized 
farm workers. 



Much of our pioneering Filipino farm workers wanted to settle down 
in a farm all their own, where they can till the soil to their satisfaction 
from sunrise to sundwn, but the Alien Land Law pf California stood in their 
desire to own a home and a land. It destroyed their incentive and their 



dreams of 
American 



raising a family to share the blessings and enjoyment of the 
way of life. 



The verdict of the Supreme Court has changed it altogether. The 
right to property ownership has released them from social and economic 
frustrations. Now, they have acquired a new vision. 

The future does not offer a challenge anymore to the Filipino., who 
are gaining stature, security and dignity through the growing faith in 
the brotherhood of men in the state of California, and all over the United 
States. 

To the members of the California Supreme Court, wh6se judgement 
granted a new lease on life among the Filipinos in California, we say: 
“MABUHAY!"

contrary view to mine may 
state his reasons. Here are my 
reasons : 

First, there is nothinj' that 
the FICOWS could do that the 
local Communities could not 
do. In fact, it is the local com- 
munities that directiv inter- 

. I « • 

venes for our people’s welfare 
in any Community, rather 
than the FICOWS. 

Durinjf Convention time the 
host Community makes the 
preparations for the big event; 
it does all the dirty work. 

When everything is in readi- 
ness here comes the big bully 
— the FICOWS — overwhelm- 
ing the local Comunity, and 
taking all the gravy of publi- 
city and credit. The poor local 
Community sits by the sideline 
in humiliated misery and sur- 
render. This happens every i by their lazy, old Uncle, the 

FICOWS. 

I suggest that in the next 
convention in San Jose, we dis- 
solve the FILIPINO INTER- 
COMMUNITY ORGANIZA- 
TION OF THE WESTERN 
STATES. Let’s hold onr an- 
nual Convention under the 
auspices of any local Com- 
munity, under its chairman- 
ship and executive manage- 
menl; and let’s encourage our 
local Communities by giving 
them their own importance 
and value without allowing an 
interloper — the FICOWS — to 
take them away like a bully 
does from a baby at Conven- 
tion time. 

The subject is open for dis- 
cussion. Let’s hear your views. 



parasite; it takes in, but it does 
not give out. That is being de- 
mocratic. 

Third, the FICOWS has 
many “wise” propositions in 
the conventions, but it lacks 
authority to assert itself. The 
local Communities cannot be 
compelled to place themselves 
unler a rule of thumb by the 
FICOWS. When anything goes 
wrong in the local Communi- 
ties, the Nationals Division of 
the Philippine Resident Com- 
missioner’s Office is being 
consulted. The Nationals Divi- 
nsio does not have to direct 
or to consult the FICOWS on 
any problems affecting our 
people ; it deals directly with 
the local Communities through 
its We.stern Representative in 
San Francisco. 

What kind of an organiza- 
tion is the FICOWS without 
authority or responsibiluity, or 
both? What can it do for our 
people that the Nationals Di- 
vision of the Resident Com- 
missioner’s Office and the lo- 
cal Communities — in mutual 
assistance cannot do? 

I submit that the FICOWS 
is an obsolete organization, 
the existence of which is an 
imposition to the local Com- 
munities. Our annual Conven- 
tions could go on much better 
without the FICOWS; be- 
cause, for the success of every 
Convention we would be giv- 
ing real credit to the host Com- 
munity to which credit is real- 
ly due. 

I mantain that the dissolu- 
tion of the FICOWS and the 
return of Convention Credit to 
the local Comrounities will en- 
courage better and better 
leadership in local Commun- 
ities, The administration of the 
affairs of our nationals will 
be more progressive because 
the local Communities know 
that the credit for their serv- 
ices and sacrifices on behalf 
of our people are not going 
to be taken away from them 



convention year. In the interim 
the FICOWS goes to its poli- 
tical hybernation — doing no- 
thing. 

Pretty soft for some people, 
you would say. 

Second, the FICOWS could 
pass appropriations for its 
maintenance, and these are 
charged to the local Communi- 
ties. And for what? 

The FICOWS does not serve 
the local COMMU)NITIES in 
any shape, manner or forpi. 
It serves no useful purpose to 
the local Communities; it is 
just like a lazy, old Uncle try- 
ing to mooch on the industri- 
ous members of his relations 
for a living. The FICOWS, as 
an organization, exists like a

Ten d ays from now you will nomin- 
ate your candidates for officers

464, American Legion, for the 
coming year. 

The privilege to vote is one of your 
rights as a member of our Post. 
In fact, it is a duty in itself, if 
you realize the moral obligation 
that goes wth it. 

If you want to have your Post have 
the leadership, you think it should 
you must take interest in the free 
exercise of your right to nominate 
and vote for the right man. 

The interest you put, in all the un-

what it is. If you want our Post to 
succeed and have the kind of lead- 
ership it has consistently mantain- 
ed for the pa/t few years, then, 
come and attend our meeting for 
the nomination of our officers. 

Our Commander, Mr. Johnny R. 
Samson, has given his word that 
he will absolutely refuse to run 
for another term. He said that to 
be a Commander of Our Post for 
four consecutive terms is too 
much for any man. Hence, he 
wants to sec that a new leader- 
ship will spring up from the World 
War 11 veterans of our member- 
•hip. 

It is your chance, fellow Comrades, 
to take active part in our Post 
and continue the work of leader- 
ship in our community. You must 
be proud in your membership with 
the MANILA POST No. 464, Ame- 
rican Legion, because it is per- 
haps the largest of its kind in 
America. At present we have 216 
members and we hope to double

Remember, come early at 2:00 P.M. 
on June 10th, 1945 in our meet- 
ing at 819 Temple Street, Los 
Angeles for the nomination of 
our officers. Don’t miss it. And 
after the meeting, we could go

Arts Hall, on Broadway in the 
evening. Please, pass the word to 
all our comrades.

Mexicans Ask for FEPC Bill 

The Los Angeles’ Mexican colony 
has soul four Mexieun-Aincricun 
leaders to Sacramento recently, to 
urge favorable legislation on a* bill 
to establish state fair employment 
practice commission. 

The four man committee, repre- 
sents 600,000 Mexican-Amcrican in 
Southern California. It will ask the 
passage of the FEPC to be passed. 

“The bill is an economic bill of 
rights for all minority groups in 
the state," said Atty. Manuel Ruix 
Jr., chairman of the committee. 

“Mexican-Americans seek no spe- 
cial privileges, but do insist on re- 
ceiving equal opportunity in holding 
down a job." 

The other members of the com- 
ittee include, Tony Sein, broadcast- 
ing company proprietor; Joseph 
Zazuota, public accountant, and

SUPREME TRIBUNAL 
MISSES MEMBERS 

The Supreme Court of the Philip- 
pines cannot hold session yet until 
President Osmena make new ap- 
pointments. Only two members of 
the Supreme Court holding office 
prior to the Japanese occupation are 
available for duty. Among those who 
will not be able to discharges their 
duties are Chief Justice Jose P. 
Laurel, who became “President" of 
the “republic" during the Jap regime 
and Clnro M. Recto, “minister of 
state." Other vacancies were creat- 
ed by the death of Judge Jose Abad 
Santos who died in Mindanao and 
the resignation of Annclcto Diaz 
who refused to collaborate with the 
Japs. Only Manuel V. Moran and 
Antonio Horrillcno remain to up- 
hold the laws of the Commonwealth.

POLITICS IN LOCAL-7, CIO. 

Nothing gives me more interest 
than to hear of reliable reports on 
the political trends going on in Leal 
7, CIO, Seattle, Washington. It is 
reliably reported that the coming 
election for the officers of said 
union is actually in debt for some 
$5000 to the industry, according to 
reliable information. It is a regret- 
table thing to know that Llocal 7, 
CIO could be so low in the finances 
as that, when its former President 
Trinidad T. Rojo, had made it public- 
ty known that the union was never 
so sound financially as during his 
'administration. And that was only 
about a year ago. 

One of the outstanding political 
straw in the wind, concerns of the 
members disatisfaction on the pres- 
ent secretary. They say that he is 
publicity-crazy like Moncado. Well, 
it’s up to the members to decide that, 
and they could do it too, pleasantly 
with their votes. 

It looks like Casimero Abella is 
going to run for president again. 



Good, more power to the old man! 
He deserves it! And I wish Mamerto 
Ventura will run as Vice-President. 
Mamerto’s record speaks for itself. 
He was responsible for order in the 
secretary’s office. He restored the 
union from the hole to a sound fin- 
ancial basis. 

I believe in the intelligent use of the 
members’ power to vote. I know that 
they will not waste their privilege 
to kick the officers out who don’t 
deserve to be there. I want to 
local 7, CIO regain its prestige and 
power and that could only be attain- 
ed by honest leadership within itself.

$1040 Bonus Proposed for GIs Gifts Now Mailable To P. I. 



WASHINGTON.— Chairman Ran- 
kin (D) Miss,, of the House Veterans 
Committee sought White House 
blessing recently for an all-out drive 
to give bonus for the homecoming 
GIs. 

ChairnKin Rankin wants Congress 
to vote a $1010 bonus to every 
serviceman and woman who has been 
in uniform at least 90 days and 
hasn’t been dishonorably discharged. 

He was coauthor of the G. I. Bill 
of Rights and of the legislation that 
raised the monthly pay of enlisted 
men from $21 to $60 a month. 

“The time to give it to them is 
now, many are being demobilized,"

he revealed that he had sought the 
views of Ih^esident Truman on the 
subject.

20th-CENTURY FOX HEAD TELLS 
RUIN OF P.L FILM BUSINESS 



Rehabilitation of the Japanese- 
WTCcked motion picture business in 
the P)iilippinfes was discussed by 
Daniel Lederman, managing director 
for 20th-Fox in the islanjds, sort of 
between yawns. The yawns were 
due to a very tough night of un- 
accustomed home conforts, it being 
the first time the veteran film ex- 
ecutive had slept in a real bed for 
more than three yearse. 

Lederman was released last Feb- 
ruary from the Japanesre internment 
camp in Los Banos. In the camp 
he bedded mostly on the ground, 
and since then he has been spend- 
ing his nights on hospital cots or 
ship’s bunks. 

“I just can’t get used to sleeping 
in a regular bed yet,” he said. 

Many Theaters destroyed 

Lederman s;aid it will be six or 
eight months, or even another year 
before the Philippine theatres and 
exchanges will be in full operation 
again. 

“Most of the 350 througout the 
islands have been destroyed,” he 
said. 

Only houses showing films cur- 
rently are the Times, Ideal and 
LjTic, first-run houses, in Manila, 
he stated. A few neighborhood 
houses in the city may now be open. 

“The entire business districts of 
many of the towns have been 
wTecked and must be rebuilt. Public 
works will get prior rights to ma- 
terials as soon as regular commer- 
cial shipping is resumed, and it will 
be some time before the rebuilding 
of theatres can even be planned, Le- 
derman pointed out. 

Film Biz First Prize 

The exchange offices, Lederman 
said, were stripped by the Japs when 

“The film business was the filjst 
industry they grabbed, ” he disclosed. 
“They took all the iron, steel and 
other metal in the office equipment 
and even pulled out the plumbing, 
they took over. 

“They brought in crews from 
Japan and started operating the ex- 
changes, distributing the American 
film to various theatres, w’here they 
were shown always in combination 
with Japanese propaganda shorts. 

Film w'as run to rags in the down- 
town Manila theatres. 

There was one projection outfit 
in the Los Banos camp, and films 
were shown there several times. 

“But they didn't get much au- 
dience because the program always 
included the Japanese propaganda 
shorts. I wouldn’t look at the d — 
things myself,” Lederman said em- 
phatically. 

Three Long Day*

LOAN PLEAS GRANTED 



While 15,000 applications have 
been made nationally in tjie last se- 
veral months for authorization by 
the Veterans .Administration of 
loans^ to veterans under provisions 
of the G.I. measure for purchase of 
homes and farms and farm equip- 
ment and engaging in business, only 
1000 of them have been carried to 
completion. 

This information was given by 
Herbert U. Nelson, executive vice- 
president of the National Associa- 
tion of Real State Boards, at a con- 
ference in the Ambasador Hotel 
Theater under auspices of the Los 
Angeles Realty Board. 



Loan Barrier Arices 

A loan barrier that has presented 
itself, it was explained, is the dif- 
ference that may arise between .ap- 
praisal evaluation of a property and 
higher market price, the official re- 
quirement being that the appraisal 
must be on the basis of “reasonable 



normal value.” 

A pending Congressional measure, 
Nelson said, would permit a veteran 
to supply out of his own funds the 
diference between appraised value 
and market price. 

Nelson who was presented )>y 
Claiborn A. Saint, president of the 
board, explained that be has been 
conferring with realty boards 
throughout the nation to gather 
opinions regardnig a program of ac- 
tivities by the national association. 

The association, he said, is op- 
posed to the idea suggested in Wash- 
ington of a 90 per cent tax on 
capital gains as a means of placing 
a veiling on realty sales. National 
organization of owners of small 
properties, steps to eliminate rent 
control as quickly as possible after 
the war, deduction of depreciation 
of owner-occupied homes from Fe- 
deral taxes and opposition to public 
housing also were among the sub- 
jects discussed. 



YANKS AND PINOYS COMPETE 
IN ZAMBOANGA SPORTS 



MANILA, May 8. — In Zamboanga war has given way to 
sports. And the Filipinos felt grateful to the 41st Division 
which had’ cleared the peninsula of the Japs.

COURT UPHOLDS 

(continued from page 1) 






have the validity of a court deci- 
sion, and many title companes re- 
fused to grant policies of title in- 
surance to Filipino buyers. 

On the repeated requests of Fi- 
lipino home owners in California 
as well as those contemplating to 
buy land, and at the instance of the 
Filipino Inter-Community Organiza- 
tion of the Western States, the test 
case which resulted in the present 
favorable decision was instituted by 
the Office of the Resident Commis- 
sioner of the Phlippines to the 
United States some time last year, 
through Mr. Alfafara of San Fran- 
cisco 'who bought a piece of land in 
San Mateo County from Bernice 
Fross. Mrs. Fross refused to convey 
title to the property in the grounds 
that her doing so would violate the 
provisions of the Allen Land Law. 
The action followed. 

The trial court refused to up- 
hold Mr. Fross* defense, and con- 
cluded that “plaintiff is a national 
of the United States of America and 
is not an alien and is not barred 
or prohibited from holding or re- 
ceving real property in the State 
of California by the Alien Property 
Initiative Act of 1920.” 

The case was appealed to the 
Supreme Court by the Defendant. 



ment was founded and the way 
paved for future granting of in- 
dependence. He is not, newcomer 
to the Islands having visited them 
shortly after the act was passed by 
Congress although he had never 
visited them prior to sponsoring the 
bill. 

Senator Tydings made several off 
the record talks during the pro- 
gryess of this investigation and was 
not as keen for Independence as 
he had been prior to his visit in- 
timating that a Dominion form of 
government similar to that of Ca- 
nada would best suit the intere.sts 
of the country. 

Just what his views will be at 
the present time are unknown but 
judgring from his former views he 
will lend a sympathetic ear to ibo- 
dification of the original act pro- 
viding they are made with under- 
standing and sincerity. 

Strategic Base* a* Economic Help 

Without a doubt both army and 
navy authorities of the United 
States will seek permanent bases in 
strategic points in the archipelago 
and this huge payroll, which wDuld 
not have existed except for World 
War II, will materially help as a 
source of permanent revenue to the 
Islands. But they will not be suf- 
ficient and lower tariff penalties 
will have to b.e agreed upon for 
the importation of sugar, hemp 
and other commodities to the United 
States if any semblance of a trade 
balance is to be mantained. Prior 
to the granting of the Common- 
wealth these products were odmit- 
ted to the United States duty free 
with practically the entire output 
being consumed by the United 
States. 

So it can be clearly seen that upon 
the recomendations of this commit- 
tee jind the action taken by the 
Congress of the United States rests 
the future of the Philippines as a 
nation regardless of its political 
future for profitable commerce is 
necessary for the self-preservation 
of any nation, especially one such 
the Philippines which is so de- 
pendent upon others for many of 
the necessities of life. 



joyment of sports, is that, they can 
mix it with Yank GIs and when they 
win, Yank referees give them the 
credit. 

When- the Japanese occupied the 
island, it was different. Whenever 
there was a sports competition be- 
tween the two nationalities — in box- 
ing and wrestling — Filipinos never 
won. It was because the Japs would 
never admit defeat and acknow- 
ledge inferiority. 

Japanese boxers and wrestlers al- 
ways get a nod from Japanese re- 
ferees of their victory; but they 
couldn’t explain why the black eyes 
and bruised torsos. Thus, the Fili- 
pinos didn’t care to compete with 
the Japs anymore. 

Fighting against the 41st Division 



men, the Filipino sluggers take near- 
ly half the decissions in weekly 
bouts. Kid Leyte, Sulu archipelago 
and southern Philippines welter- 
weight champ before the war, has 
won all bouts against the Yank 
boxers. 

The Filipinos are not strong on 
baseball and basket ball, but they 
are learning. A Sunday morning 
baseball school for youngsters is be- 
ing conducted by Pfc. Fred Sanford, 
former St. Louis Brown pitcher.

SENATE APPROVE 
JOINT RESOLUTION 
FOR NOV. ETECTION 

OSMENA AND ROXAS ARE 
CANDIDATES; BETTING 2-1 
IN FAV OR OF ROXAS 

— The Philippine Senate has approved a joint 
resolution providing for the election of Commonwealth officials 
tlm coming November. It is expeaed that the House will follow 
suit and approve the resolution. 

In this eleaion President Sergio Osmena and General Manuel 
A. Roxas will be the contending candidates for President. 

According to all reports and surveys, Gen. Roxas will beat 

President Osmena easily. 'ITte peo*^ 
pie are disappointed with Osmena’s 
failure to do anything substantial 
or definite for them while he was 



in exile in Washington for three 
years, although he reported to 
them by' radio during that time 
Uiai he was going to do a lot of 
things for them. 

All that Osmena could present 
to the people is a series of reports. 



Osmena Junket 
Is Condemned By 
Filipinos Here 



The reaction to the MAIL’S 
story of the air-plane trip of sever- 
al Filipino ladies from Washington 
to Manila furnished them by Pre- 



V,. .sident Sergio Osmena is one un- 

full of words and statistics, of a | animous and angry indignation, ac- 
so-called technical committee ap- cording to the communications rec- 



pointed by him in Washington 
whose members receive unreason- 
ably high salaries sufid allowances. 
No one takes the reports seriously 
for they are considered the work 
of theorists and government stu- 
dent pensionados who have had no 
practical experience in economic 
L^uestions. Senator Tydings and 
other officials never consulted the 

Tlie people also say that Osmena 
is still the politician, first last and 
all the time. His thoughts and tac- 
tics are those of the politician. Be- 
hind his smiles and soft words is 
a political mind that is always in- 
fluenced in his public actions by 
what they might do to his personal 
political fortyme. His prestige has 
proved empty and is now blasted. 

But, over and above all, the 
thing that has turned the people 
against him is his crass failure 
to do anything constructive for 
them while he was in Washington,

Collaborationist Trial 
Of Rev. Sobrepena On 

MANILA— The first trial before 
a military tribunal of a Filipino 
Japanese collaborationist has 
been started. A Protestant clergy- 
man, Rev. Enrique Sobrepena, who 
used to live in the United States. 



eived. 

When no one but few public offi- 
cials, not even businessmen who 
could start industries and create 
employment for the Filipino peo- 
ple, could go to Manila by plane 
or by boat. President Osmena ex- 
tended his "gracious courtesy” to 
Filipino ladies in Washington to go 
to Manila to join their relatives. 

These ladies, besides his wife, 
maid and daughter .are Miss Pac- 
ita Madrigal. Miss Alicia Clemena, 
Mrs. Guillermo Hustia and Mrs. 
Ismael Mathay. 

If this thing had happened with 
Americans, the public official in- 
volved would be investigated, made 
to explain and condemned by the 
entire people. 

With the Filipinos, used to the 
worship of public officials, all they 
say is "Ohis” and "Ahs”. some of 
them, encouraged by office-holders, 
even say that it is "unpatriotic” to 
expose the misdeeds of public offi- 
cials. Of course, these people do 
not yet know what democracy is 
and they believe that a public offi- 
cial, especially he who has given 
them their jobs .can commit any 
wrong. 

Writers- suggest that the Army 
and Navy officials should be asked 
why and how the junket was per- 
mitted. It was clearly against the 
war effort. And certainly it was 

^ , . destructive of public morale, 

is charged of disloyalty to the Only two months before the 

PhUlppine and American govern- President Osmena came to 



ments. 

A long parade of witnesses filed 
before the tribunal testifying to 
the utterances of Sobrepena to 
the effect that Japan and her ideas 
policies were the best for the 
Filipino people and that the people 
had better decide to accept them 
with 8 l 11 their heart. Articles, 
statements and tracts expressing 
similar ideas uxitten by him were 
presented in evidence. 

The Rev. Sobrepena served as 
a chaplain at Bataan during the 
battle there in 1942. He is con- 
sidered the most prominent Pro- 
testant leader and evangelist in 



Washington by plane from Manila 
accompanied by Mrs. Osmena, 
maid and daughter and son. The 
son stayed in Washington, but the 
family returned with him to 
Manila. In both trips Major An- 
tonio Madrigal was with the Presi- 
dent. In the last trip a doctor and 

a secretary also went.

Confesor Not 
Coming After 
All Plans 



Tomas Confesor, who resigned 
as Secretary of the Interior in 
the Osmena Cabinet, is not com- 
ing to Washington to act as mem- 
ber of the Filipino Rehabilitation 
Commission. He is going to run as 
Vice-President on the Osment tic- 
ket. Tomas 'Cabile, who resigned 
as Secretary of National Defense, 
may not be awning also, for he 
will help the Osmena-Confesor tic- 
ket ret elected. 

Confesor and C^abili have been 
trying to dub Gen. Manuel Roxas, 
the opposing candidate for Presi- 
dent, as a Jap collaborationist. 
But the confidence shown by Gen. 
MacArthur in Roxas neutralized 
all their efforts. Manila newspaper- 
man David Bugoslav, uTiting in 
the “Christan Science Monitor,” 
said that the a^intments of Con- 
fesor and Cabili in the Osmena 
Cabinet would not be confirmed 
by the Roxas-cont rolled Cabinet 
and so they resigned.

Rotor's Secret Mission 
For President Osmena 



WASHINGTON— Dr. M. Rotor, 
a secretary of President Osmena, 
arrived in Washington by plane 
from Manila and announced that 
he had a "secret mission” for 
Osmena. Th emission was not so 
secret, or for that matter, so im- 
portant at all. And yet it cost 
the government at least a couple 
of thousand dollars. He told Sec- 
retary Hernandez who the new 
Cabinet and Rehabilitation mem- 
bers will be and what changes in 
personnel in Manila will be. All 
those matters could have been 
written in a simple letter. Rotor 
has two or three little errands to 
make and that’s what the "secret 
mission” is all about. Dr. Rotor 
doesn’t know five prominent 
Americans here, and that most 
casually. 



That Berstein 
Again And At 
$10, (KN) 

That publicity man, Dave Bern- 
stein. will bo the publicity man 
of the Philippine government in 
Washington, according to reports 
emanating from there. If that’s 
true, that will start the Filipinos 
squirming, kicking and protesting. 
They could’ use the $10,(XX) on a 
more suitable and competent man. 

Bernstein does not know the 
Philippines. His Idea of publicity 
is to glamorize certain personali- 
ties like he did with the late 
President Quezon and members of 
his family. He uses flattery and 
lays it down thick. And the re- 
sult was ludicruous if not cheap. 

The Philippines has serious and 
tragic problems. They are essen- 
tially of an economic nature and 
arc concerned chiefly with meas- 
ures pending in Congress. Why 
are we going to have a man to 
publicize and flatter certain Fili- 
pinos? The Filipino people, es- 
pecially the fighters and the guer- 
illas, will resent It bitterly. 

Bernstein Went to the arrmy as 
a non-commissioned officer, a 
Sergeant, it is understood. Now 
he is coming to the Philippine 
government to start some sort of 
Hollywood publicity at a salary 
about equal to that of a Major 
General in the Army. It is terrible, 
it is unthinkable, it is condemn- 
able!! 



Peorson Drew Denials 
From Gen. MacArthur 



Drew Pearson, the most-heard 
radio commentator, drew denials 
From Gen. Douglas MacAthur that 
he didn’t give Senator Millard 
Tydings cooperation and welcolme, 
that he didn’t want to have Gen. 
George Patton under him and that 
he had differences with Gen. 
Dwight Eisenhower when the lat- 
ter was on his staff about ten 
years ago. Pearson came back and 
said that Gen. MacArthur refused 
to have Gen. Kirk, the surgeon 
general, and Gen. Gregory, the 
quartermaster general to come to 
Luzon from Leyte.

Confessor, Cuenco 
V-P Candidates All 
Yisayan — Why? 

MANILA TTie contending tic- 
kets In the coming elections in 
November are now complete. With 
Sergio Osmena of Cebu for Presi- 
dent will run Tomas Confesor of 
Hoilo. And with Manuel Roxas of 
Capiz will run F. CXienco of Cebu. 
Confesor is not coming to Wash- 
ington yet. 

All the four candidates are from 
the Visayan islands. The largest 
island in the Philippine archipelago 
of Luzon is not represented. Re- 
sentment and rumorings have al- 
ready arose as a result of this. 
It’s possible that another ticket 
will be in the field. " 

The Luzon guerillas and those 
who fought in Bataan In 1942 are 
asking how come. The resentment 
is much stronger against Osmena. 



Rice Planted Around 
Jap Emperor's Palace 

To dramatize the extreme need 
for food in Japan, Emperor Hiro- 
hito has "graciously” consented 
to have rice planted in the im- 
perial grounds around his palace. 
Expecting Japan to bo effectively 
blockaded, Jap leaders are urging 
people to plant every inch of 
ground and produce food. Fishing 
has been greatly impaired through 
destruction of flshmg boats and 
shortage of gasoline. Many fisher- 
men have been called to the Navy 
and many of them have been killed. 



Insigne's Speeches 
Are Not Understood 
By Filipino Farmers 

BRAWLEY, CALIFORNIA — 
The so-called Labor Coordinator 
Manuel M. In$ig:nc made talks and 
conferences among Filipinos here. 
Nobody understood his ideas or 
plans. They sounded somewhat 
communistic. He talked about co- 
operation. It was as clear as mud. 
He didn’t understand it himself. 
The most important thing, though, 
is that all the Filipinos know that 
Insignc Is a flat failure as a farm- 
er and So he has no business to 
give any advise to Filipino farmers 
who are successful. No one believed 
him. Filipinos do not want him 
to come around again. 



A Filipno Peso 

Is Worth 6 Ctvos 



Where Are They? 

The Prisoners Fate 



The cost of goods, including 
’food and other necessities of life, 
in Manila has gone so high that 
the value of the mdney, the Fili- 
pino peso, has gone corresponding- 
ly down. At present a peso will 
buy only 6 centavos worth of 
things. 

The government is doing every- 
thing to stablize the peso, but 
it Is not able to do so because 
the cause of the depreciation of 
the peso is the fact that there 
is a scarcity of goods to buy. It 
is, in short, the old law of supply 
and demand. When the demand is 
greater than the supply the price 
goes up. 






Hernandez To 
London With 

Entourage 

/ 

Dr, Jaime Hernandez, in charge 
of the Philippine government office 
in Washington, is going to London 
to attend the sessions of the 
United Nations Relief and Rehabil- 
itation Association. He will be 
accompanied by Dr. Cinco. law 
expert. Dr. Amando Dalisay, agri- 
cultural expert. Dr. Gonzalo, medi- 
cal expert and other doctorated 
and deodorated experts. The trip 
Is estimated to cost at least $10,- 
000. The conferees will be away 
for three weeks or so. 

*1710 UNRRA’s central office is 
in Washington, about three blocks 
from the Commonwealth office. 
It has no activities in the Philip- 
pines. Why the Doctors will spend 
so much government money and 
neglect the Philippine work in 
Washington is beyond any sane 
person to comprehend. The Os- 
mena government is so expensive 
in times of poverty and has been 
shooting many blank shots. Oh 
well, he won’t be President long. 
He’ll get licked as he deserves. 



Jap Puppeteers 

Are In Iwahig 

The members of the Jap puppet 
government who did not escape 
to Japan are in an internment 
camp on the small island of Iwahig 
off the elongated island of Pala- 
wan. Among them are Jose Yulo, 
Claro Recto, Rafael Alunan, Quin-

would like them to do just that.

Tydings Used Data 
Collected In 
Manila 



PRIVATE CONCERNS 
ORGANIZED UNDER 
RIZAL BOOK SHOP 

PHOTOSTATIC COPIES OF 
DOCUMENTS SECURED; 
REPORT ED TO ROXAS 

By Ex-Officio 

A great, big scandal may break anyday in the Philippine gov- 
ernment office in Washington. It involves the creation of private 
corporations by certain Filipino officials to engage i(^ private 
profits. 

For some time now it has been rumored that several private 

corporations have been organized by certain Filipino officials and 

■ ■ ■ ♦ r egistered in Manila. Their ‘names 



The report and recommendations 
of Senator Millard Tydings are 
based on data which he collected 
in Manila, including data furn- 
ished by the Philippine government 
there. The question has arisen 
about the work of Technical Com- 
mittee headed by Dr. Urbano Za- 
fra in the Washington of/ice of the 
Philippine government. If their 
studies and reports are not going 
to be used, what’s the use of hav- 
ing them? And what's the use of 
having any committee at all? 

Senator Tidings says in his re- 
port; "Liwcwisc, President Osmena 
and the members of the Filipino 
Government were always access- i 
ible to us and furnished us with 
every bit of information which we 
desired. To fulfill one request made ; 
by the Chairman (himself*. Presi- 
dent Osmena put a staff of 25 men 
to work for five solid days and far 
into the night to turn out some re- 
ports which we thought the Cong- 
ress would like to have on matters 
affecting the future of the Philip- 
pines, with particular reference to 
our relations with them.” 

The natural question to ask isi 
Why didn’t President Osmena sim- 
ply turn over to Senator Tydings 
the reports and studies which the 
Technical Committee here in 
Washington has worked on for 
•over one year? 



Villomin In Thick 
Of Work To Induce 
Japan To Surrender 

Reports from Washington arc 
that Attorney-economist Vicente 
Villamin is ii> the thick of the 
work that the Federal government 
is doing in inducing the Japanese 
to^ surrender. Psychological war- 
fare is becoming more and more 
important, especially when it is 
believed by many competent ob- 
servers that the war with Japan* 
is entering upon the psychological 
stage. 

Mr. Villamin has written ap- 
peals both to the Japanese fighting 
and home fronts which the gov- 
ernment is using. They differ from 
what the government has been us- 
ing before in that they arc mostly 
based on the economic self-in- 
terests of the Japanese as an in- 
dividual and as a nation. 

Psychological warfare is credited 
with the increase of the surrender 
ratio at Okinowa, from one sur- 
render for every 99 Japs killed 
to 11 surrenders. The appeals to 
the Japanese home front have 
for their purpose the cracking of 
the will of the Japanese people to 
support the military leaders to go 
on fighting to the bitter end. 

The shortening of the war by 
an early Japanese surrender and 
therefore the saving of many lives 
and material costs are the objects 
of psychological warfare. 

The Big Three — President Tru- 
man, Mr. CThurchill and Generalis- 
simo Chiang Kai-Shek — issued an 
ultimatum to Japan to surrender 
from Potsdam in Germany. But 
the Japanese rejected the ultima- 
tum. Now it is the work of psy- 
chological warfare to convince the 

leaders to weigh the ulUmatum son. lawyer, and son of Teofilo 
Japanese people and the civilian | Sison, alleged Jap collaborationist 



do not appear in the incorporation 
papers, but it is alleged that the 
names of relatives do appear. 

If things go right, it is expected 
that the corporations will make 
millions of dollars because they 
will be doing business at a time 
when the Philippine commerce will 
be started after it has been sus- 
pended during the Japanes occupa- 
tion of the Philippines. 

Status of Officials 

The scandal is that* government 
officials have no right in law and 
in morals to engage in private 
business which will have to do with 
the business of the government in 
which they have the poNver to de- 
cide. It is clear that such corpor- 
ations owned by public officials 
will have an undue and illegal ad- 
vantage over private corporations. 

In the United States such sitUr 
ations are condemned and officials 
involved are hailed in court, tried 
apd punished. In time of war such 
actions on the part of public offi- 
cials are doubly to be condemned. 
What makes it all the more ter- 
rible is that the Filipino officials 
said to be involved have not seen 
any military ser\ice at all and, in- 
stead of doing their work for the 
Filipino people, they are spending 
their time lining up their pockets. 
Such things are worse than collab- 
orationism. It amounts to treason.

The son-in-law of Secretary of

soon arrive in Washington as a 
government official. He is M. Si- 



and see in it the salvation of Japan 
from destruction. 

Mr. Villamin is devoting most 
of his time in Washington to psy- 
chologncal warfare, saying that the 
shortening of the war is the great- 
est and most important work that 
a person could engage in. He is 
giving but incidental consideration 
to Philippine matters at present.

Barred From 
Islands After War 



After the Battle of Bataan in 

1942 about 18,000 iVmerican sol- 
diers were taken prisonrs by the 
Japanese. Of this number, 1,447 
have been liberated. 3,260 have 
died and some 12,000 shipped to 
prison camps in Japan, China and 
Manchuria. There are still 16,553 
soldiers whoso whereabouts are not 
known. 



MANILA — The Philippines 
Confress has approved unanimous- 
ly a bill barring Japanese immigra- 
tion from the Pihilippines after the 
war. Before the war a similar law 
was considered, or even a law plac- 
ing Japanese immigrants under a 
quota, the Japanese government 
sent a communication to the Pihil- 
ppine government which amounted 
to a threat. Now it’s different. 



Roxas Election A 
Virtual Certainty 

MANIA The election of Gen. 
Manuel A. Roxas as President over 
Sergio Osmena, present incumbent, 
is a virtual certainty. The majority 
will be ovenvhelming. Osmena has 
shown nothing to convince the 
people that they should vote for 
him. His government is weak. He 
has no plans. He brought nothing 
from Washington except some 
vague plans and promises. He is 
considered too old. He has not 
shown much executive ability, 
people saying that the late Presi- 
dent Quezon killed it or weaken it 
in Osmena’s. Ro.xas has every- 
thing to commend him. 



puppeteer. Young Sison’s work is 
not yet known to the public, but 
it is known that he was appointed 
by Ismael Mathay, budget director 
and fonner assistant of Hernandez. 
So it is believed he may become 
disbursing officer or something 
connected with the handling of 
funds. He may probably take the 
place of M. Vera, the disbursing 
officer in Washington, 

Already from Washington re- 
percussions are coming to Sison’s 
appointment. Nepotism is being 
charged, with well-paid jobs going 
to relatives of public officials. The 
morale of the Filipinos in the Com- 
monwealth office is going down 
and down. Everybody is afraid that 
the political ax might drop on 
his neck to make way for some 
friend or relative. Influence, not 
efficiency, seems to be the most 
important factor in holding posi- 
tions in the present Osmena-Hem- 
andez government.

international security conference 
at San Francisco cost the Philip-

about $30,000. Gen, Carlos Romulo

Mac Arthur Over All 

The authoritative "Army and Navy Journal", published 
in Washington, points out that there are five segments in 
the command in the Pacific and urges their consolidation in- 
to one supreme command, with Gen. Douglas MacArthur 
as the supreme commander. Hanson Baldwin, military 
editor of the "New York Times," says the same thing. And 
so do other authorities. The command under MacArthur, if 
it is created, will be greater than the command of Gen. 
Eisenhower in Europe. The MAIL is all for MacArthur for 
anything that requires ability, experience and success in the 
highest degree. Let the leaders of America, Britain, China, 
France and Holland see the light and let the world witness 
Douglas MacArthur emerge as the Conqueror of Japan. 



Why All Visayan Team? 

According to a Manila dispatch, published elsewhere in 
this issue, the candidates for President and Vice-President 
on both the Osmena and Roxas tickets come from two 
islands — Cebu and Panay. Luzon, the largest island with the 
largest population, is not represented. This omission is un- 
democratic, unjustified and precedented. It is never too late 
to reaify an error and both President Osmena and General 
Roxas should demonstrate their bigness by making the 
necessary change. We expect Roxas to heed this, if possible, 
but hardly expect Mr. Osmena to do it, because he wants 
to have a guerilla with him to gloss over his absence in 
Washington from the country during the war.

Me For The Babuyanes! 

The ' deployment and re-deployment of the officials ^ 
the Philippine government in Washington is a study in stra- 
tegy arid psychiatry. Here are the facts: The work for the 
Philippines is in Washington, and yet those officials go all 
over creation, absenting themselves for long periods of time 
and accomplishing no concrete results that will benefit the 
Philippines in the present posture of affairs, and causing the 
neglea of Philippine interests in Washington. 

The trip of Secretary Jaime Hernendez and entourage to 
London to attend the meeting of UNRRA, which has noth- 
ing much to do with the Philippines, is the latest example 
in point. It’s like when the fighting is in Bataan the fighters 
go to the Babuyanes! It’s running away. It’s wasting energy. 
It’s leaving the real work undone. It’s perfealy an anti- 
Philippine move. It’s asinine to the most exasperating de- 
gree.. It must stop. 

o 

Osmena In Washington 

President Osmena during the years of fighting in the 
Philippines was residing in Washington, first as Vice-Presi- 
dent and then as President. It is reasonable for the Filipino 
people to inquire what he has accomplished in Washington 
for their well-being. They will be told by Osmena himself, 
as he did in his long message to the Philippine Congress, 
and by his appointees, both Filipinos and Americans. That 
information is one-sided, ex parte, as the lawyers call it. It is 
the duty of persons here in America who know Mr. Os- 
mena’s work, or lack of it, here to tell the Filipino people 

what they -know. 

For their information, the best proof that he hasn’t done 
much, if anything, in America is the lack of relief, lack of 
organization, lack of competent personnel, lack of coordin- 
ation, lack of consistent policy and lack of work that they 
themselves see in the Philippines. In fact, about the most 
concrete work that Mr. Osmena has done in America was 
to have helped in suspending the Philippine Constitution 
and thereby setting a precedent that bodes ill for the future 
of the Filipino people. His record in Washington will be 
discussed in detail if it becomes necessary to do so for the 
enlightment of the Filipino people. The MAIL considers it 
a patriotic duty — without taking sides in the eleaoral camp- 
ign this coming November. 

Oh. For The Boys Of Bataan! 

Where are the boys of Bataan — the leaders? They will 
not be found in President Osmena s government. Why, 
why and why? Were not the fighters of Bataan the very 
blessed ones that uncovered the Philippines to the entire 
world in glory, heroism and nobility? Have they all died— 
they whom the Japanese have not killed— or perished in 
enemy prison camps, or simply languished in physical agony 
and spiritual frustration? From our tiny nook in the vast 
sweep of human doings and plannings, we cry out for recog- 
nition of the men of Bataan, the men that God will not for- 
get but which wilfull men are apt to forget and seem to be 

forgetting. 

Irony, Where Is Thy Sting? 

A Manila press dispatch tells of the investigation for 
the purpose of m^ing out punishment of alleged irregular- 
ities among certain Filipino war prisoners in Japanese 
camps in the Philippines. Those to be investigated were the 
fighters of Bataan who were taken to the camps after the 
“Death March” and subjeaed to the most inhuman and 
cruel treatment that most of them lost their minds. The in- 
vestigator is Major General Basilio J. Valdes, who never 
fought in Bataan or anywhere, and who was in Washing- 
ton during the battle on that now hallowed ground 10,000 
miles away. That moving passage in the Bible comes to us 
with forcible effect— “Oh, death, where is thy sting? oh, 
grave, where is thy victory?”

In such a diplomatic situation 
the full concurrence of the entire 
delegation, or at least a majority 
of it. would be the irreducible de- 
siderattum. This is predicated on 
elemental procedure and is dicta- 
ted by the fundamental require- 
ments of the democratic process. 

The practice of the minority of 
duly accredited plenipotentiaries 
committing a government to an in- 
ter-national agreement is indeed 
fraught with the most dangerous 
possibilities and it should be dis- 
couraged and prevented. This is 
particularly applicable to a coun- 
try, like the Philippines, which is 
on thcthreshold of becoming an in- 
dependent nation. 

We have a suggestion to make: 
Let the absent delegates execute 
a formal instrument after reading 
the document, that they conform 
to the Warld Charter and state 
that the two Filipino signers there- 
to represented their own will and 
purpose; and let that instrument 
be authenticated and filed with the 
Secretariat of the Conference or 
its legal successor. 

We must vindicate government 
determinations, especially in inter- 
national affairs, by majority ac- 
tion. We must avoid minority rule 
and thereby arrest any and all 
totalitarian tendencies. Let us keep 
the democratic process inviolate 
and involnerable. (Note: When 
delegates are sent to an interna- 
tional conference, especially at 
great expense, let them attend to 
their duties to the end of the con- 
ference. Those who deserted the 
conference to attend to their priv- 
ate business should be asked to re- 
imburse their expenses and should 
never be sent to conferences 
again).

The following ultimatum to 
Japan to surrender was issued on 
July 26, 1945 at Potsdam, Ger- 
many, by President Harry I^. Tru- 
man for the United States, the 
then Prime Minister Winston S. 
Churchill for Great Britain, and 
(^neralissimo Chiang Kai-Shek for 
China. Although Japanese leaders 
have rejected the ultimatum at 
first blush, watch how they will 
pale down, sober up, and accept 
it eventually, thereby ending the 
war. Of course, the military pound- 
ing is the thing that will convince 
them to accept it.

of the visit of two pretty girls

the additional news that several 
Filipino youngmen have become 
romantically disturbed. 



Washington, D. C. 
July 17, 1943. 

Mr. J. C. Dionisio, 

Representative, Western Division 
Office of Philippine Resident 
Commissioner, 

San Francisco, California. 

• 

Dear Mr. Dionisio: 

Reference is made to your letter 
inquiring how Filipinos in the 
United States may bring their kins- 
folk here from the PhDippines. 

Arrangements have been made 
by General MacArthur with the 
Departments of State and Justice 
to permit Filipino nationals, who 
are either married to American 
citizens or who have children bom 
in the United States, to enter the 
United States without passport 
visa and at the expense of the 
United States Government. These 
Filipinos come in as temporary 
visitors for a period of one year. 

Other Filipinos who are not 
similarly situated also may come 
to the United States either as tem- 
porary visitors or as students at 
their own expense and with the 
necessary passport visa. Any per- 
son falling under this group who 
desires to come to the United 
States should apply to the Amer- 
ican Consul-General in Manila for 
passport. He must show that he is 
able to take care of his expenses 
incident to his stay in the United 
States. He should present to the 
(Consul his birth certificate and, if 
this is not available, his baptismal 
certificate, health certificate, and 
a statement from the local police 
that he is a person of good moral 
character. 

At present any person desiring 
to leave the Philippines has to be 
cleared by the Counter Intellig- 
ence Corps of the United States 
Army. If he is coming to the 
United States as a student, he 
should, in addition to the require- 
ments already mentioned, present 
to the American Consul a letter of 
admission from the Registrar of 
the college or university where he

he knows too much about them

and will fight them. 



'T. We, the President of the 
United States, the President of the 
national government of the Re- 
public of (Thina and the Prime 
Minister of Great Britain, repre- 
senting the hundreds of millions of 
our countrymen, have conferred 
and agreed that Japan shall be 
given the opportunity to end this 
war. 

”2. The prodigious land, sea, and 
air forces of the United States, the 
British Empire and CTiina, many 
times reinforced by their armies 
and air fleets from the west, are 
poised to stirke .the final blow at 
Japan. This military power is sus- 
tained and inspired by the de- 
termination of all Allied nations 
to prosecute the war against Japan 
until she ceases to resist. 

"3. 'The result of the futile and 
senseless German resistance to the 
might of the aroused free peoples 
of the world stands forth in awful 
clarity as an example to the people 
of Japan. 

“The might that now converges 
on Japan is immeasurably gn^ater 
than that which, when- applied to 
the resisting Nazis, necessarily laid 
waste to the land, the industry 
and the method of life of the 
whole German people. 

"The full application of our 
military power, backed by our re- 
solve, will (underscored) mean the 
inevitable and complete destruc-

and just as inevitably the utter 
devastation of the Japanese home- 
land.

the evil ambitions of men and na-

carry what the author believes are 
seeds of OUR WORLD, a world of 
men living in peace, great in their

Creator watches over them in their 
earthly paradise. He loks into what 
wickedness, righteausness, and

for supremacy there must also be

also consider that before anyone 
begins to love and understand the 
rest of the world, there must also 
be an underiStanding and love for 
one’s country. That is precisely 
what Mr. Pecson is. Know your 
s^urrounding, your own land, before 
you can hope to know the rest of 
the world. One orients himself in

accordance with his knowledge of 
his country. Knowing that country 
also precisely means knowing its 
history, the wrongs it suffered 
from how it can hope to live with 
the rest of the world. 

Love of Country 

So the transition is from love of 
one’s country to love for the rest 
of the world. Therein lies the logic 
of the two books. 'Therein also lies 
the author’s understanding of the 
world. One may have a fierce love 
for his country and people and still 
have a fiercer love for mankind. 
Fierce, not according to the voc-

BUSINESS 

TRENDS 




By E. IXA>US ROSARIO 

Executive Secretary’ Philippine 
Chamber of Commerce 
of America 
RUSSIAN TRADE? 

Some time ago Finance Secre- 
tary' Jaime Hernandez, chairman 
of the Filipno group of the Filipino 
Rehabilitdiion Commission, an- 
nounced the Philippines' proposal 
for continuation for a period of 
twenty years of the existing trade 
relations between America and the 
future Philippines Republic. This 
proposed, it is believed, w'ould give 
the Philippines as a free nation, a 
chance and enough time to recover 
from the economic havoc of the 
war. 

Supposing that such free trade 
relations between the two coun- 
tries W’ould be consumated, what 
would be the next possible step 
for the Philippine Government to 
take? 

Reports have ccMne from some 
reliable quarters that Filipino 
leaders are looking towards Rus- 
sia. In the event that the U. S. 
Congress doesn't approve of giving 
the Philippines such trade momen- 
tum necessary to put her on her 
feet economically and as a free 
nation, one alternative is to nego- 
tiate with Russia. 

One story’ illustrates Russia's 
ability to buy’ a goods from abroad. 
It happened one day in Russia dur- 
ing Eric Johnston’s trip to Moscow. 
Johnston, president of the Cham- 
ber of Commerce of the United 
Slates, made the trip for Amer- 
ican business. 

“I suppose you’ll have a bad de- 
pression in your country' after the 
war," Stalin said. 

“Many people feel so,” Johston 
replied. 

“How much will we have to buy 
to keep your people employed?" 
Stalin asked. ‘T think you ought 
to start getting those figures to- 
gether so you’ll know how much 
well have to buy from you." 

"Why do you want to this?” 
Johnston queried with surprise. 

"Because you did us a big favor 
and wc want to do one for you," 
Stalin answ’ered. 

There is a story which is re- 
ported to have come from Wash- 
ington that the Russian Govern- 
ment has made overtones to the 



Philippine Government on Russian- 
Philippine trade relations. It is 
said that Russian officials have 
tlod Philippine officials that Rus- 
sia could buy three times as much 
as the United States was buying 
from the Philippines. 

And, for good measure, at high- 
er prices. 

INDEPENDENCE BUGABOO 

NATION’S BUSINESS, official 
magazine of the Chamber of Com- 
merce of the United States, re- 
marked in its July issue that the 
Philippine independence may be 
postponed indefinitely beyond pres- 
ent statutory -date, January 1946, 
if Congress approves Senator 'Tyd- 
ings’ report on a proposed $100,- 
000,000 reconstruction program. 

“Tydings found 15 per cent of 
all Philippine dewellings and build- 
ings destroyed by war, another ten 
per cent damaged, says the NA- 
TION’C BUSINESS. "U. S. Army 
now is feeding 600,000 persons in 
Manilla, Government has ordered 
225,000 Ions of rice for Filipino 
emergency feeding in six months 
starting ii\ November. 

“All mining is practically sus- 
pended for want of machinery. 
Sugar, the Islands' No. 1 money 
crop, is burned out. Before Pearl 
Harbor, U, S. took 900,000 tons of 
Philippine sugar annually.” 

Ti’dings report was published in 
full by both the PHIUPPINES 
MAIL and the PHILIPPINE REC- 
ORD, two sister publications: and 
Filipinos w'ho have read the re- 
port have not found anything like 
NATION’S BUSINESS inference 
that independence may be post- 
poned. 

The $100,000,0^ is an outright 
gift proposed bjr Senator 'Tydings 
for the reconstruction of the Phili- 
ppines. In so far as the report is 
concerned, there are no strings at- 
tached to it. 

The series of luncheons and 
meetings scheduled by the Philip- 
pine Chamber of Commerce of 
America to be held in communities 
w’here there are Filipino business- 
men is designed to bring business 
unity. 

Filipino businessmen particular- 
ly in California find that it is to 
their advantage to unite in busi- 
ness rather than be individualistic. 

Wherever the Board of Direc- 
tors of the Chamber meet, the 
emphasis is on BUSINESS UNITY. 
UNITED WE STAND IN BUSI- 
NESS, DIVIDED WE FALL, 
seems to be the general feeling. 



Did Osmena Shatter 
The Constitution 
In Washington? 

MANILA — In his first long mes- 
sage to the Philippine Congress, 
President Sergio Osmena failed to 
say a word how he worked to have 
the Philippine Constitution partial- 
ly suspended by the U.S. Congress 
and deprived himself the constitu- 
tioncti right to succeed as Presi- 
dent on November 15, 1943 as the 
Filipino electorate wanted him to 
do as expressed by their votes in 
the election of November 1941. 

'Tw’o other questions have come 
up: How did Osmena succeed to 
his present position of President — 
under the Constitution or under 
the Joint Resolution of the U.S. 
Congress; and was he invited by 
President Franklin Roosevelt in 
January 1942 to come out of Cor- 
regidor and come to Washington? 
With respect to the late President 
Quezon, he was invited by Presi- 
dent Roosevelt to come to be "the 
symbol of Philippine redemption." 

As It was, Osmena came to 
W^ashington with Quezon and be- 
came the symbol of do-nothing- 
ness. Well, it won’t be long now. 
The November election is coming 
along and Osmena will be so over- 
whelmingly defeated by General 
Manuel Roxas that he wouldn’t 
know what hit him. 

(Note: President Osmena hasn't 
done anything for the Filipinos in 
America except make promises to 
them. He hasn’t even answered 
their appeal for leadership to mob- 
ilize them so they could the better 
serve in the war. He hasn’t helped 
them to prepare themselves for 
service in their country after the 
war as many of them wanted to 
do. He simply worked the Old Poli- 
tics in Washington and then went 
back to the Philippines and asked 
the people to elect him President).

In his Washington office Presi- 
dent Osmena has what is known 
as “Technical Committee to the 
President.’’ It is composed of 
Philippine student pensionados who 
were in the States when the war 
came. The head is Dr. Urbano 
Zafra, who is the only one who 
has actual business and profes- 
sional experience as economist and 
statistician. 

The (Committee, after nearly two 
years, produced a series of studies. 
The best one is on the subject 
of trade relations. The others no- 
body takes seriously. In fact, after 
looking them over, American of- 
ficials and experts threw them 
down and said they are sopho- 
moric, exaggerated, unreliable and 
highly academic and theoretical. 
I And so they never use them. Sen- 
jator Tydings didn’t use them in 
preparing his reports. 

So the question is. Shouldn’t 
the Committee be dissolved or 
iat least diminished in membership 
and ship the student pensionados 
back to Manila, where they can be 
I much more useful? Another sug- 
gestion, considered a good one by 
( all, Americans and Filipinos, is 
j to have some real able men on the 
Committee, men that American 
officials and experts will take ser- 
i iously and follow. But as it is now, 
the reports have no weigght and, 
therefore, useless. Such are the 
I facts and President Osmena should 
j consider them and stop being too 
i political and make the necessary 
i changes. 



In the Philippines, 
May 31, 1945. 

Editor: 

The Plhilippines Mail, 

Salinas, Calif. 

I am taking time today to write 
and there from my travels up and 
down these Islands ministering to 
you bits of news .gathered here 
our troops. The people here are 
making a marvelous come back to 
life. They are beginning to smile 
now. Children are playing in the 
streets unafraid. Towns and vil- 
lages are springing to life every- 
where as people return to their 
runined homes. Schools, churches, 
and stores are opening their doors. 
I have visited several schools and 
I find that the present generation, 
of Filipinos are receiving better in- 
struction and are a lot smarter 
than my own generation. Many 
children have to be turned away 
for lack of room and insuffieWat 
clothing. I have also been visiting 
Proiestan local congregations that 
now meet in homes for most of the 
churches are in ruins. It is good to 
be able to tell discouraged and de- 
jected Christian people that the 
mother church in America has not 
forgotten them; that they will re- 
ceive help just as soon as trans- 
portation will permit. In many 
cases we have to start all over 
again with many of our mission 
work. I feel like a foreigner in my 
own country for I require an inter- 
preter every time I meet with a 
congregation. Many of these 
church people like the children 
stay aw’ay from church for lack of 
clothes to wear. You can help them 
by sending me your discarded old 
clothes to cover their nakedness. 

Now, just a few words about the 
1st Filipino Infantry. As you know 
this outfit is composed of Filipinos 
who were U.S. residents when the 
war came. Although, we have not 
been mentioned in the war news 
from the Pacific, we have not been 
idle since we landed here. This 
unit was given the tough assign- 
ment of mopping up enemy pockets 
isolated in many of these islands. 
'The men were chosen for this 
particular job because of their 
familiarity with the country and 
their ability to survive jun^e life 
for weeks on nothing but roots, 
herbs and snails. It is nei^e- wreck- 
ing to fight an unseen enemy who 
is able to choose the time and 
place to ambush you. Many a 
trol has been attacked without 
warning, leaving their dead and 
wounded behind only to find them 
later stripped with all their wea- 
pons and clothing. As a Chaplain 
I find it quite a strain to be talk- 
ing with a man one day and then 
conducting his burial service the 
next. We have just completed a 
campaign in one island and as we 
move to the next, we leave our 
dead behind us. Filipinos and Am- 
erican (officers) who will never 
see the States again. 

The death of President Roose- 
velt came as sudden shock to 
all of us here. We took it for a 
false rumor at first. Memorial 
services were held in every town 
and village and many prayers were 
offered to God for the new Presi- 
dent. The Filipinos feel that they 
have lost a good friend. 

Sincerely yours, 

Fernando A. Laxamana.

Mobile Medical 
Dispensaries Are 
Needed In Islands 



While war rages in the Philip- 
pines. the needs of the Filipnos be- 
come more and more pronounced, 
it was stated in a report by Charles 
P. White executive director for 
Philippine War Relief, a member 
agency of the National War Fund. 
Among the most urgent require- 
ments necessary to provide addi- 
tional aid to the war-stricken Fili-' 
pinos are some twenty mobile med- 
ical dispensaries vitally needed in 
these areas fast being freed by 
advancing American forces. 

Ever since war burst in all its 
fury in the Pacific, the 17,000,000 
Filipinos who have beensubjected 
to Japanese tyranny have been 
homeless, hungry, ill and ragged. 
As the Japanese are being driven 
out of the islands, the liberated 



areas should be provided with the 
means whereby the cirilian inhab- 1 Lodge, CDA, dance at Forester 



SPOTLIGHTS 

By MISS SPOTTER 
Hello boys and girls! Here, I am 
again after two months’ absence. I 
know you missed this column so 
much. In fact I have received hun- 
dreds of letters begging me to re- 
sume the fireworks. I owe an ap- 
ology to all of you— you who love 
to read this column. First, I wish 
to explain the reason why I was 
absent for two months. Do not 
think for a moment that it is only 
an alibi but believe it or not my 
boy friend had a 60-day furlough 
after three years fighting in Eu- 
rope. He begged me to be with him 
every minute of those 60 days, so 

that’s that. Can you blame me?

MANILA- -Out of the blue sky 
came the familiar Paul V, McNutt. 
He came to investigate “Health and 
economic conditions” of the Fili- 
pinos and report to President Tru- 
man, McNutt, bronz and helmitted, 
issued a series of denials — that he 
was not going to be High Commis- 
sioner again, that he wasn’t taking 
sides in the Osmena-Roxas politic- 
al contest, that he was’nt on a 
trans-Pacific Junket, he was’nt 
discussing the postponement of 
Philippine independence, etc. He 
was accompanied by Gen. Rose, 
several doctors and experts in re- 
lief matters. What will come out 
of the McNutt dash to Manila re- 
mains to be seen. 



In Washington McNutt’s de- 
parture for Manila was a surprise 
both to the public and government 
officials concerned with the Phili- 
ppines. Few knew he was going. 
He denied he was going. It was 
only when he reached San Fran- 
cisco that he made his trip public. 
The word “junket" was heard in 
many circles. The Tydings commis- 
sion had just been to the Philip- 
pines and there are already many 
Federal officials there. Mr. Mc- 
Nutt and Gen. Rose are chairman 
and vice-chairman, respectively, of 
the War Manpawer Commission, 
which, as rumor has it, might be 
transferred as a division in the 
Labor Department under the com- 
petent e.x-Congressman Clinton 
Anderson.

A comprehensive family welfare 
program, which during 1944-45 en- 
gaged the activities of over 3,000 
groups of volunteer workers in the 
United States in the preparation of 
clothing for Filipinos, must be e.x- 
panded to an even greater degree, 
it was revealed in the Philippine 
War Relief report, if that agency 
i^ to help provide adequate meas- 
ures for aid in the stricken areas. 

The need for mobile medical aid 
units is vital if the threat of epide- 
rhic and the menace of malnutri- 
tion are to be checked. Mobile 
health units are important to reach 
large portions of the population 
who have no means of travel to 
centralized clinics, even if such 
clinics were in existence.

that she is entitled to it. despite

Speech Delivered 
By B. R. Losada 

Mr. Toastmaster Our Guest of 
Honor-Distinguished Visitors, La- 
dies and Gentlemen. 

In the name of the Supreme 
Consistory which I proudly lead, I 
welcome you all and extend to all 
our warm greetings and good wish- 
es. To our Honored Guest I speci- 
ally wish to extend our profound 
gratitude and appreciation in mak- 
ing this evening a memorable one. 

To the Dignitaries of our be- 
loved C.D.A. who constitute the 
pillar of our Organization, I con- 
gratulate you all in the steady 
progress you have achieved to- 
wards the fulfDlment of our gold- 
en dream: It seemed only yester- 
day — 1920 — to be exact when the 
word C.D.A. was practically un- 
known. Like all good and worth- 
while things in life, it found its 
place among the thoughtful Fili- 
pinos. In the way of perpetuation 
the Filipinos, few in number, band- 
ed together, forming this Brother- 
hood, whereby they practice the 
full meaning of comradeship, fel- 
lowship-and service to one another 
but above all of Love of Country. 

As in anything riew there were 
obstacles unavoidable in the form- 
ation of any solid organization. We 
found criticisms, pessimisms, and 
false interpretation of our prin- 
ciples; we received discouragement 
and all sorts of hindrances. We did 
not know how far we could go~we 
only knew that we must go on. 
And thanks to every member, we 
have brought this Brotherhood to 
be one of the biggest and most re- 
spected Organizations in this coun- 
try. But dear brothers let not be 
said that our task is ended — on the 
contrary it is just beginning. In 
your very hands lie the life and 
existence of our Bro. Without you, 
we are nothing — uith you we can 
be everything you desire us to be. 

At no time the history of our 
Country and our Organization is 
there a more abundant opportun-

SAN FRANCISCO - Climaxing 
the four-day conclave of the Reg- 
ional Supreme Consistory Cabal- 
leros de Dimas-Alang was a ban- 
quet and ball held at the Fairmont 
hotel last Saturday, July 28, where 
Attorney General Robert W. Ken- 
ny and Representative J. C. Dion- 
sio of the Resident Commissioner’s 
Office spoke as guests of honor. 

Attorney General Kenny, who is 
well remembered by. Filipinc« for 
his now famous ruling that Fili- 
pinos are not aliens and therefore 
can own real estate property in 
California, spoke of his awareness 
of “the vast distinction between 
political independence and econo- 
mic independence. 

“I am aware, continued Kenny, 
that it would be insufficient to 
guarantee merely political inde- 
pendence to a small nation without 
at the same time helping to secure, 
by preferential treatment and by 
other means, freedom from econ- 
omic domination by large nations. 
Only in this way can the Filipino 
people be said to have a free hand 
in the government of their own 
country. I am also aware of the 
fact that very much remains yet 
to be done in winning that prefect 
independence for the Philippines.’^ 

Kenny points to the need for 
better understanding between Am- 
erica and the Philippines. 

“It is sufficient, I think,’’ said 
Kenny, if note is now taken of 
that fact, and if the occidental 
peoples approach the question with 
a consciuousness of their failings 
in the paist and a sincere desire to 
improve their conduct in the fu- 
ture. But disregarding for the mo- 
ment the cause of that lack of un- 
derstanding between the races, the 
fact remains that it exists, and so 
existing it needs to be met honest- 
ly and dealt with so that interna- 
tional harmony in an organization 
to maintain the peace will function 
securely. 

“Once again I believe that the 
Filipino people and the Common- 
wealth of the Philippines points 
the way to one of the good ans- 
wers,” says Kenny. And that is 
why I speak of it here. Because 
of the decades of relations between 
America and the Filipino people, 
and because those relations have 
been good, I am hopeful tha^ the 
job of interpreting the Occident to 
the Asiatic peoples and likewise 
the job of interpreting orientals 
to the occidental peoples will be 
undertaken by the Filipino people. 

“I am confident,” concluded 
Kenny that I will see a nation, 
great in achievement, respected in 
council, and a leader among na- 
tions of the world.” 

Representative J. C. Diemisio of 
the Western Division spoke also 
that evening as guest of honor. 

“I have watched the progress of 
this organization for years, says 
Dionisio. “And when I went to 
Washington, D. C., I had occasion 
to tell the late President Quezon 
of the many plans of this organiz- 
ation particularly the Bayan Dim- 
as Alang.” 

'The public reacted unfavorably 
when Represent ative Dionisio 
touched on independence where he 
said that whether Filipinos like it 
or not, independence is a settled 
question and we shall have it; and 
those who are not for independ- 
ence are either traitoi's or cow- 

Dr. Maximo Kalaw 

Up In The Air 

NEW YORK CITY — Dr. Maxi- 
mo Kalaw spends much time here. 
But he is up in the air because 
he has not been re-appointed to 
the Osmena Cabinet. As a result 
he is breathing fire and is starting 
to condemn Osmena and his in- 
efficiency and his very political 
methods. 

Kalaw was the Secretary of 
Public Instruction, a member of 
Osmena's Cabinet. Then Osmena 
sent him to San Francisco to be 
a member of the Philippine dele- 
gation to the international con- 
ference. Before that pdw-wow was 
finished he came to Washington 
and here. Then Osmena asked all 
members of his Cabinet to resign. 
Kalaw complied. And this is the 
day when he is not yet reasigned. 
And so he is up in the^ clouds, 
with his status unkown. As it is 
he is not in the government. 

But Kalaw is busying himself 
finding publishers for his book 
on the war in the Philippines. 
He is also busying himself in other 
matters that might bring him a 
lot of money. Kalaw is a Luzon 
man and is reported to be dis- 
gusted with the all-Visayan teams 
in the coming elections.

was revealed. It appears that in 
that year there was a Far Eastern 
Olympic games held at Manila. 
The Japs, wanting to have the 
necessary points to win, insisted 
that there should be a Marathon 
Race of 19 miles. And it so had to 
be run. For the Philippines Vic- 
ente Villamin, a law student, was 
selected. And to give him moral 
support from the start of the race 
near a cemetery, were selected 
students Manuel Roxas, now candi- 
date for President, and Jose Laur- 
el, ex-puppet President of the Jap- 
Philippiine Republic. Runner Villa- 
min came second in a field of 12. 

islands has not been heard about. 
He was in Hollywood and delivered 
a speech at the Hollywood Bowl 
on July 4th. While in Southern 
California he called on Mrs. Man- 
uel Quezon and family.

Osmena Plane Junket 

Washington— The Office of De- 
fense Transportation has heard of 
the plane trips given by President 
Osmena of the Philippines to lady 
friends from Manila to Washington 
and the other way around. It has 
been asked how such a thing as 
a junket across the-oontinent and 
the Pacific Ocean could happen or 
be permitted, since the junketeers 
have nothing to do with the war 
effort in any way, shape or form. 

The junketeers are the two 
daughters of a certain alleged Jap 
collaborationist who is now under 
arrest by the American Army in 
Manila. Vicente Madrigal, and 
wives of Filipino officials. They are 
Miss Pacita Madrigal, Miss Maria 
Madrigal, Mrs. Guollermo Rustia, 
Mrs. Ismael Mathay, Miss Alicia 
Clemena, besides Mrs. Osmena, her 
18-year old daughter Rosie and 
her maid. Also Major Madrigal^ 
Dr. Antonio and Mr. Canceran. 
What a junket! In wartime, loo.

CDA BANQUET HELD AT FAIRMONT HOTEL, SAN FRANCISCO 




Three Meals In One 

Is Talk Of Town 



J.\CKSONVILLE. FLORIDA — 
Tic way some Filipinos attacked 
the food in a leading restaurant 
here about three months ago is 
still the talk of the town. The 

story is that some Filipinos came 
from Manila accompanying the 
Filipino president, Mr. Sergio Os- 
mcna, who came for medical treat- 
ment. Well, guess they were very 
hungry and sp some of them gave 
three orders each and, believe it 
or not, they finished the triple 
orders with gusto. People say it 
was not surprising with regard 
to Filipinos who came directly 
from Manila, where they starxed, 
but they can't explain with regard 
to the P'illpinos who came from 
Washington. D. C. who came to 
meet their President. (Note: 
Jacksonvillians, please forget the 
episode, the boys were awful hun- 



gry.)

Osmena's Luxury Is 
A Biographer! 



One of the guest speakers dur- 
the CDA banquet and IkUl held at 
Hotel Fairmont was Lt. Col. F'lor- 
encio Selga, above, who just re-, 

cently arrived from the Philippines 
to take an advance training course 
in America. He .was with some 
other twenty-one O/ncers. Lt. Col. 
Selga spoke briefly about the suf- 
fering of the unsung heroes in the 
Pliilippines. He was one of those 
men in the March of Death. 

— Photo by Chas. M, Hiller, 



President Sergio Osmena, before 
he left for Manila about two 
months ago, appointed James Ayre 
with the designation as "adviser.” 
His work is going to be to write 
the biography of Osmena for the 
coming FUipino generations. Ayre 
flew to Manila. Big salary and 
allowances. Glamour and power, 
Ayre is not identified with Philip- 
pine affairs before. Needing some- 
thing to do. he went to the late 
Dr. Joseph Hayden for help and 
the latter suggested him to Os- 
mena. What if Osmena is defeated 
next November. What a postlude 
for Ayre to write about That 
ain't fair to Ayre. (Note: Ayre’s 
salary and expenses should be 
paid out of President Osmena's 
private pocket.) 

A 



Reorganization of the Philippine 
Government in Washington is on 
the vv'ay. Most of the offices except 
the Resident Commissioner's will 
either be abolished or transferred 
to Manila.

mulo gets through writing books," 
said a thoughtful and philosophi- 
cal Filipino. TTien he added: "I 
wonder if naming books like 
‘Mother America' and ‘My Brother 
Americans’ like Gen. Romulo has 
done doesn’t look like flattering 
the American people loo much and 
too brazenly.” 

"Let the books sell, the more 
the better, but let them stand on 
the merits of their contents and 
not on irrelevant catchwords and 
phrases for their names,” he went 
op. "We can praise America too 
much — much too much and the 
praise might boomerang against 
us,” he asserted. 

The reference is to the books 
written by Gen. Romulo named 
"Mother America" and "My Broth- 
er Americans” and to the report 
that the General is writing an- 
other book, which .according to 
speculators, might carry a name 
like "Grand Uncle Sam”, or 
Grandad America" or (God for- 
bid-hold me!) "Damn the Ameri- 
cans.” 

The lamentation of a disillusion- 
ed man is pertinent to remember. 
It goes somewhat like this — "He 
may be a brother to you, but he 

ain’t a brother to me."

President Sergio Osmena, know- 
ing that he will be defeated, is try- 
ing to get Gen. Roxas to his side 
by running as Vice-President, "re- 
ports from Manila state. "But 
Roxas knows that he is going to 
be the winner and Osmena the 
loser, and why should he consent 
to be the No. 2 instead of the No. 
1 on the ticket?" 

But Osmena is pulling out all 
the political tricks from his bag, 
but so far General Roxas is indiff- 
erent to his entreaties. Roxas 
would lose all his prestige and his 
good name if he succumbs to Os- 
mena’s manipulations, for that 
would show that he has a weak 
character and his regard for the 
welfare of the Filipino people is 
not sincere. 

Osmena is talking incessantly of 
"unity,” meaning that he should 
be elected President. But people 
say that "unity” should mean the 
election of Roxas, who can serve 
them much better than Osmena, 
who is considered a failure. Os- 
mena talks about old times, his 
long years in public life, and his 
desire to crown it with the Presi- 
dency. But the people say he has 
been President for a year, but he 
hasn’t done anything for them. 

It is the general understanding 
that Roxas has been offered by 
Osmena any position that he cares 
to pick — as Filipino chairman of 
the Filipino Rehabilitation Com- 
mission in Washington to take the 
place of Jaime Hernandez, who 
has proved completely inadequate, 
unsuited and ineffective in that 
position; or as Secretary of the In- 
terior which will make him the 
virtual Vice-President. But, thanks 
to his good judgment an his real 
patriotism, he is not listening to 
Osmena.

cisco. In his speech, he lauded the 
CDA fraternity members for their 
efforts in doing something tangi- 
ble for the reconstruction of the 
Philippines, like the Bayan Dimas- 
Alang. 

Highlight of Dionisio’s speech: 
"We must change our attitudes; 
we must not forget that our coun- 
try is still at war; that there are 
still Japanese there, that the scars 
of war will tak a long time to heal. 

We must not forgot that we 
have a -duty to perform towards 
our country and our people back 
home who are suffering untold 
hardships and agonies. Our coun- 
try is on the threshold of a new 
life. We must face the fact that 
soon our country will be Independ- 



ent, for the independence of the 
Philippines is k settled issue. We 



will have it whether we like it or 
not. We know that our country is 
devastated, that we caQ, never rise 
by ourselves alone. Biit we must 
take the bitter with the sweet.

Mr. Vicente Madrigal is the 
No. 1 shipping magnate in the 
Philippines. He struck it rich in 
shipping, coal and other business 
eriterprises. He is a close friend 
of President Sergio Osmena. His 
son. Major Madrigal, is the mili- 
tary aid to Osmena. 'Two of his 
daughters were Osmena’s guests, 
coming and going, on government 
planes between Manila and Wash- 
ington. 

'File American military authori- 
ties in Manila finally decided that 
Mr. Madrigal should not be per- 
mitted to be in circulation and so 
he was placed under detention. 
He was found to be working with 
the' Japanese or otherwise close 
to them in his business ventures, 
one of which was the "Jai-Alai”. 

Long before the war Madrigal 
had close connections with Jap- 
anese business houses. So it was 
natural, when the Japanese came, 
to call on him for collaboration. 
Madrigal was hard put to it be- 
cause he wanted to be true to the 
United States and the Philippine 
government. But, with the urgings 
of the Filipino puppeteers, he con- 
tinued his business operations with 
the Japanese. 

Madrigal has been of great help 
to Mrs. Osmena and family while 
they were hiding from the Jap- 
anese who were trying to appre- 
hend them. He was the president 
of the Philippine Chamber of Com- 
merce before the war and one of 
the leading civic leaders in the en- 
tire country. 

The Madrigal steamship com- 
pany had half a dozen ships ply- 
ing between the Philippine and 
American ports before the war. 
If he is proved a collaborationist, 
he will lose many rights, privileges 
and advantages under American 
and Philippine laws which bar 
those who cooperated with the 
enemy. Madrigal will have a 
chance to clear himself if he can 
when he faces the military tribunal 
which has started its sessions in 
Manila.

Family Friend Is 
New Center Manager 



WASHINGTON — A friend of 
the Osmena family. Mrs. Gloria 
Tuason, is now the manager of 
the Philippine Center, taking the 
place of Dr. Ubaldo, who is now 
warming a chair wondering what’s 
it all about and looking for some- 
thing to do. Mrs. Tuason is a 
mestiza who was not particularly 
interested in Filipinos and Filipino 
work. But she is a friend of Mrs. 
Sergio Osmena and needed a job. 
So a ^ob is given her. Satisfecha, 
chica? Si, comon no? But the 
Filipinos are disgusted and disap- 
pointed. President Osmena, who 
condemned Quezon for his luxury, 
is proving to be more so. 






U. S. Filipinos are wondering 
whether election of either Osmena 
or Roxas would cure part of our 
national cancer: caciquism, com- 
padre system, manana habit, ego- 
testical leadership, clique system, 
etc.

Senator Tydings 
Has Three Bills, 
Action In October 



WASHINGTON — Senator Mil- 
lard Tydings has presented three j 
bills in Congresss to carry out the i 
recommendations that he set forth ■ 
in his speech in the eSnate on June j 
7th. The most remargable thing 
about the bills is that they are dif- 
ferent from his recommendations. 
The bills will be taken up after 
Congress comes back from recess 
in October. 

One of the bills relate to free 
trade after independence which 
provides for about 20 years under 
certain restrictions. The other re- 
lates to war damages for those 
who sustained small losses, ap- 
propriating $100,000j000 therefor. 
And still another has to do with 
the transfer to the Philippines of 
certain sugcur and coconut oil 
funds. The “out-right gift” of $1,- 
000,000,000 to the Philippine gov- 
ernment is yet to be provided for 
in a separate bill. (Note: We take 
it that Senator Tydings is taking 
a long breath before disgorgoing 
another $100,(XX),0(X). So far, 
thanks to the great Senator.)

OBSERVATION/ 

HOLLYWOOD — Although only 
three months in office, Hafr>' S. 
Truman’s popularity as President 
has definitely been gaining mo- 
mentum and does continue the 
longer he stays in office. At this 
writing he is getting the lion’s 
share remarkably at the Big Three 
Conference at Potsdam, Germany. 

It’s strange, but some people are 
not sure if Truman is the only 
man from Missouri to become 
President. 

The answer is —Harry S. Tru- 
man is the only Missourian so far 
who became the country’s Chief 
Executive. 

Others ask: “Supposing Senator 
Taft would be elected President, 
wouldn’t that make Ohio “the 
Mother of Presidents"? 

Just supposing (because it is far 
from being a reality) that Senator 
Robert A. Taft of Ohio would be 
elected our next President, still 
that would not make Ohio "the 
Mother of Presidents". That will 
mr»^ly make her a twin sister to 
V^ii ,inJa for the distiction. the 
score would be 8 to 8. At is it at 
present the state of Virginia is still 
"the Mother of Presidents’’.

ational subject and for the benefit

Insigne's Doings 
Puzzle Several 
Filipinos Here 

EL CENTRO— Why Manuel M. 
Insignie, Coordinator of Labor Re- 
lations in the Office of the Presi- 
dent of the Commonwealth of the 
Philippines, is going only after 
well-established farmers here has 
been palgueing the small ones. To- 
date a Filipino farmers’ cooper- 
ative has been organized under the 
advisorship of Coordinator Insigne. 
It is composed of a president, sec- 
retary, a treasurer, and the mem- 
bers of the board of directors. 

So far, it has been reported, the 
cooperative has no fimds'yet, and 
farmers who have stayed away 
from Mr. Insigne’s brainchild are 
beginning to ask questions. In fact, 
questions had been asked before, 
only he did it first. 

Coordinator Insigne passed hun- 
dreds of questionairq^ when he 
first came to Imperial Valley. Six 
hundred farmers filled up the 
spaces for ansv\’ers. 

The prayers that Mr. Insigne 
could be the person from the Gov- 
ernment who would bring them a 
long-hoped-for financial aid was 
nearly answered. It goes as far as 
that, because Mr. Insigne has told 
the farmers that it is not forth- 
coming. All he can promise them is 
his technical help as a coop expert. 

Smaller farmers see where 'the 
rub comes in, however, and they 
have surmised that the reason why 
big, well-established 'farmers have 
been rounded up to form the nuc- 
leus of a cooperative is not be- 
cause a model is first to be formed 
but for Mr. Insigne to be in it him- 
self sometime in the future. 

"We don’t see any reason why 
Mr. Insigne has td come to Imper- 
ial Vallcyr’ one farmer said. "If he 
meant to begin where there is real 
work to do, it is right near San 
Francisco, where his office is lo- 
cated. 

’There is an organized body of 
Filipino farmers near Stockton 
which has been looking for expert 
advice and somebody to lead them. 
'They have even a little money in 
their treasury. There are hundreds 
of farmers around Sacramento and 
San Jose waiting to be organized. 
Now, I ask, why does Insigne come 
to far El Centro and spend Gov- 
ernment money in per diem and 
traveling expenses when he can 
step out of his office into the 
midst of the waiting farmers?’’ 

Here in El Centro the first ques- 
tion that has always been asked 
was whethgr any financial help 
will soon come from the Philippine 
Government. Mr. Insigne's answer 
is that the Philippines needs all 
the money for reconstruction. To 
which some farmers have added 
while talking among themselves: 
If that is the case, there is no need 
for him coming here, or anywhere 
else. We had managed before he 
came. Surely, wo can mange with- 



out him now. 'The money the gov- 
ernment spends for him might just 
as well be sent to help the needy, 
or help rebuild schools. 

The persistence of Insigne. how- 
ever, has surprised many Filipino 
leaders here. When he came for 
the first time. Filipinos could not 
believe that he was the same In- 
signe who castigated many govern- 
ment officials as a newspaperman. 
At one of the meetings, an un- 
believing farmer stopjd up and ask- 
ed for his credentials. Insigne had 
to empty his pockets of every card 
and letter identifying him as one 
in the service of the Philippine 
Government. 



Better Economic Life 
Is Villamin's Plan 
For FilipiiiO People 

NEW YORK CITY Talking 
with newspaper editors and maga- 
zine writers here, Vicente Villa- 
min, Filipino writer and econom- 
ist. stated that his greatest inter- 
est is in seeing that the economic 
life of the Filipino people is much 
improved. Before the war, he said. 

a Filipino family of four or five 
members received an income of 
only $75 a year, about $20 of which 
was paid to the government in 
taxes, direct and indirect. If that 
situation continues there will be a 
revolution in the islands, he said. 

Mr. ViJlamin stated frankly that 
he was associated before the war 
with commercial interests, but he 
has always tried to fight for high- 
er wages for the workers and more 
income for the farmers. He cited 
the fact that w’hen he was in 
Manila last he expressed these 
j ideas in the presence of the repre- 
sentatives of the largest business, 
manufacturing and banking con- 
cerns in the Philippines. He said 
that the Filipino labor element re- 
acted most favorably to his state- 
ments. 

"We Filipinos must have a defin- 
ite plan for a new economy to be 
vigorously worked out,” he de- 
clared. “If the people's econmic 
life is not improved, then woe to 
the political leaders," he said. For 
the sake of the people, their better 
life and peace of the country, Fili- 
pino leaders, in and out of the gov- 
ernment, should get together and 
decide upon a plan of national re- 
construction as well as regener- 
ation." 



STOCKTON — An uproar has re- 
cently gone up among Filipino far- 
mers here over news that Manuel 
M. Insigne organized a Filipno far- 
mer's cooperative in Imperial Val- 
ley. Insigne’s title, that of Coordin- 
ator of Labor Relations in the 
Office of the President of the 
Commonwealth has also been 
puzzling them. To many labor men 
here, Stockton should be Insigne’s 
first concern, in as much as it is 
the center of Filipino labor trou- 
bles for many seasons now. 

The cause of the uproar, it is 
pointed out, is that Stockton is 
nearer than Imperial Valley. It is 
the contention of mose Filipinos 
here that if Insigne’s title means 
anything at all, he should have 
come here long ago. Instead, it is 
rumored that he has been asking 
J. C. Diqpisio of the Western Div- 
ision to solve all problems first, 
after that, Insigne’s Solomon ws- 
dom would be necessary, that is, if 
Dionisio fails.

Judge C. Sandoval 
Coming, Very Sick 

MANILA — Judge Claudio 
Sandoval left for the United States 
in a plane accompanied by an 
Army nurse. The transportation 
was proNided by General Douglas 
MacArthur, who knows Sandoval 
Intimately, being the sponsor in the 
Legislature of the Philippine No- 
tional Defense Act when he was 
Representative from Palawan 
province. 

It is believed by those close 
to Gen. MacArthur that he wanted 
Judge Sandoval to be the Sec- 
retary of National Defense in the 
Cabinet of President Osmena. San- 
doval is a brother-in-law of Gen- 
eral Vicente Lim, of Bataan fame, 
and of the well known lawyer- 
economist, Vicente Villamin, who 
is in America. If he recovers and 
returns to Manila, he may still 
be a member of the Cabinet cither 
of Osmena or Roxas 

SAN FRANCISCO^A distingu- 
ished Filipino patient was register- 
ed at the University of California 
Hospital here. He is Hon. Claudio 
Sandoval, fonner member of the 
Philippine legislature and judge of 
the Court of First Instance. His 
case will probably take several 
months to dispose of. He will have 
the best professional service avail- 
able. 

Mr. Sandoval was visited by 
Ml'S. Ursula Villamin, who came 
from Los Angeles and by Capt. 
and Mrs. Mariano Sulit of this 
city. According to preliminary re- 
ports, the patient has better than 
an even chance to pull through. 



SAUNAS. CALIF. — (Filipino 
Press Alliance Release) — Under 
the able and active leadership of 
Mrs. Marina K a n g 1 e o n Malbas, 
the Filipino Woman’s Club of 
Salinas has sponsored several civic 
activities, such as the Used Clothes 
Drive for the Philippines and the 
National Used Clothing Drive; the 
sending of Christmas packages to 
soldiers overseas; the collection 
for the Red CYoss; and the pre- 
sentation of $350.(X) to the War 
Chest during its last drive. 

Most outstanding of its activi- 
ties is the presentation of $1,000 
in cash to President Sergio Os- 
mena of the Philippines to be used 
for the purchase of food, medicine 
and clothing for relief in the 
mother country. The project 
sounds preposterous because of the 
enormity of the need compared to 
the seemingly meager sum donat- 
ed, but when one takes into ac- 
I count the fact that the Filipino 
Women’s Club of Salinas is com- 
posed of just a handful of civic- 
minded women — twenty-one of 
them to be exact — this manifesta- 
tion of generosity is edifying. 

Officers of the Club are: Presi- 
dent, Mrs. Marina K. Malbas; 
Vice-President, Mrs. Paula Gali- 
cia; Secretary, Miss Rebecca Pac- 
ulba; Assistant Secretary, Mrs. 
Jessie Enebrad; Treasurer, Mrs. 
Ruth Layugan; Assistant Treasur- 
er, Mrs. Esther Sun; Auditor, Mrs. 
Eva Bautista. And the following 
are the members: Mrs. Maria 

Calitesen; Mrs. Virgina Brillante; 
Mrs. Dominga Olivete; Mrs. Felisa 
Sabro; 'Mrs. Annia Avilla; Mrs. 
Mary M a n z a n o; Mrs. Fausta 
Puyud; Mrs. Agnos Jason; Mrs. 
Margaret Dacquel; Mrs. Gracia P. 
David-Maglig, Miss Lucille Avilla, 
and Miss Nene Galicia. 



We aspire to a government rep- 
resenting all the live forces of the 
country, in which the most able, 
the most worthy in virture and 
talent, may take a part, without 
distinction of birth, fortune, or 
race. — from "Bitter Tears of 

Mother Philippines,” by 
E. C. Pecson.

Reported to Roxas 
Filipinos who know the inside of 
the situations in Washington are 
supposed to be sending reports of 
the cases to Gen. Manuel A. Roxas 
in Manila since he is expected to 
be the next President of the Phili- 
ppines. Photostatic copies of docu- 
ments have been secured, it is un- 
derstood. 

It is more than possible that the 
situation will become one of the 
issues in the coming election in 
November. President Osmena is 
responsible for the administration 
of the government office in Wash- 
ington, where Mr. Jaime. Hernan- 
dez is directly in charge. Mr. Her- 
nandez is going to be in London 
when the case comes up. 

Plenty Time To Play 
The fact is that most of the Fili- 
pino officials in the Common- 
wealth office in Washington have 
plenty of time to devote to private 
business because they don’t have 
enough to do in their government 
offices. Many of these officials 
have developed a sense of super- 
iority. They drew disproportion- 
ately big salaries and big allow- 
ances. 

Joaquin Cun an an and Leonides 
Virata are in charge of the buying. 
What part they have in the mush- 
room corporations, if any, is not 
known. (Note: The MAIL hopes 
the investigation is started if the 
facts do warrant. It also hopes 
that the charges in the foregoing 
article may be proved false. But, 
if true, those guilty should be pun- 
ished severely because in these 
days of war when the Filipino peo- 
ple expect public servants to be 
faithful, the faithless ones should 
be incarcerated).

people! 

But what has Jimmy Hernandez 
done in Washington for four 
years ? One answer is : He received 
a per diem of $25 a day, every day, 
including Sundays and holidays, 
during all that time. Together with 
his enormous salary, his free rent 
and transportation plus his stingi- 
ness — well, our great Jimmy will 
return to the Philippines a rich 
man. Congratulations! But look 
out of the Filipino guerijlas who 
suffered and improverished them- 
selves and whose comrades were 
killed by the enemy. Look out! 
Cuidao, Chico! 

Another thing Hernandez has 
done in his four years in Washing- 
ton is: Practically nothing. And 
yet he thinks he is a great man 
and a great patriot, and it was ru- 
mored even that he wanted to be 
Vice-President of the Philippines. 
Naku, de por si que es un gran 
ambicioso! 

I have known Hernandez for 
more years than I care to count 
It’s many years. Back in Bicolan- 
dia. How the years have gone by. 

His position as Co-chairman of 
the Filipino Rehabilitation Com- 
mission is far beyond his ability 
to discharge efficiently. He does 
not have the perparation and the 
personality for it. Ask the other 
Filipino members. They all hang 
their heads in apology and indig- 
nation. What a chairman, what a 
spokesman, they all exclaim. He is 
an expensive failure. Es una^ lata, 
sabes ? 

But Jimmy Hernandez sits in his 
office, closes his door, and makes 
himself mysterious to ^ther Fili- 
pinos. At first they thought he was 
really doing some big things, but 
as time went on and nothing was 
accomplished, well, they lost con- 
fidence in him. 

American members of the Re- 
habilitation Commission couldn’t 
get it through their heads why 
Hernandez was the chairman and 
spokesman of the Filipinos since 
he could not answer questions well 
or present his views effectively. He 
was a great disappointment to 
them. Ask the American members.

is a newspaperman in Spanish and 
for many years have not 
practiced his journalistic profes- 
sion, for he had no newspaper to 
write for. As a writer, he special- 
ized in political questions. He does 
not know economic questions. 

So the general opinion is that 
the change from Mrs. Lim to Mr. 
De la Paz is certainly for from 
being justified. Osmena was purely 
actuated by politics in making the 
chEuige. Filipino women are en- 
raged and they will help to bury 
Osmena deep in defeat in the 
coming November election.

WASHINGTON — Americans in- 
terested in the Philippines unani- 
mously condemned President Os- 
mena when they learned of tfie 
non-appointment of Mrs. Lim to 
the Rehabilitation Commission, 
saying that Osmena has thereby 
proved his nairowrmindedness, if 
not his unfairness, to the Philip- 
pine women. They consider Mrs. 
Lim as a useful member of the 
Commission. Mrs. Lim hasn’t 
made a public statement. She is 
believed to be preparing to go 
back to the Pacific Coast to live, 
probably in Berkeley or Los An- 
geles.

The Filipino Community of Sa-

of the Community with the coop- 
eration of the Filipino Women’s 
Club of Salinas, under the leader-

a mass meeting last Sunday after- 
noon (Nov. 11) at the Salinas 
Union High School Auditorium 
welcoming the arrival of Miss 
Ruby Roxas in C^fomia enroute 
to New York where she will con- 
tinue her studies. AUss Roxas is 
the talented and attractive daugh- 
ter of Brig. <3en. Manuel A. Roxas, 
president of the Philippine Senate 
and Presidential candidate of the 
Philippines. She was accompanied 
by attorney Marcial Lichauco and 
Mr. and Mrs. Primo Villarruz of 
San Jose. 

The miiss meeting was presided 
by Mr. M. R Galicia. The 500 
Filipinos and their families gave 
a hearty ovation to the distin- 
guished guest when she was in- 
troduced. Mr. Lichauco spoke in 
behalf of Hon. Manuel Roxas.

WASHINGTON — When the re- 
liable NEWSWEEK magazine 
stated that Resident Commissioner 
Carlos P. Romulo was button-hol- 
ing and approaching American 
government officials to help the 
Indonesians in their fight against 
the Dutch and the British in the 
Netherlands East Indies, represen- 
tatives of foreign governments 
concerned decided it was time to 
call the attention of the. American 
Go<^rliinent Yd *tRe illegality and 
irregularity of such activities on 
the part of a representative of a 
country that was associated with 
the United Nations in the war. 

Several governments are sup- 
posed to be involved. To them Gen. 
Romulo was already persona non 
grata because of his attack on 
them in his article in COLLIER’S 
magazine in connection with the 
administration of their colonies in 
the Far East. This fact will impair 
the General ambassadorial ambi- 
tions, for one thing. And for an- 
other, the Philippine bills in Cong- 
ress might suffer from his excur- 
sions in highly controversial ques- 
tions in international affairs, as in 
effect they are already suffering, 
especially among House members. 

President Osmena was here and 
could have advised Gen. Romulo to 
go slow and be careful so the 
Philippine bills in Congress don’t 
receive any set-back, but he choses 
to remain silent, probably being 
ignorant of what’s going on. Fili- 
pinos and Americans would like 
Gen. Romulo to attend to Phil^ , 
pine affairs first then 
they are taken care of, he can re- 
sign from the government and then 
he can do what he jolly wants. 
From his writings and speeches 
lately, the Philippines is only inci- 
dental to his grand ideas for the 
entire world.

To the Attorney General: 

While the mass of the Filipino 
people and many of their leaders 
remained staunchly loyal during 
invasion and rendered Invaluable 
assistance to our arms, it is neces- 
sary to admit that many persons 
served under the puppet govern- 
ments sponsored by the enemy. 
Some of these, especially those en- 
gaged in health and educational 
work, ramained at their posts of 
duty with an evident intention to 
sustain the physical and cultural 
welfare of their people. Others of 
the clerical and custodial services 
continued in office in order to earn 
their accustomed livelihood and

States with him via Australia. He

with Gen. MacArthur and Presi- 
dent Osmena. 

Gen. Valdez is a perfect gentle- 
man, but nearly came to blows 
with his subordinate, Brig. Gen. 
CI^los P. Romulo, in Leyte. Al- 
ready annoyed by Romulo's bold 
attempts to be in the forefront and 
in the photographs with MacAr- 
thur, Gen. Valdes got finally peev- 
ed over him taking care of Romu- 
lo's belongings while Romulo 
romped about for publicity that he 
nearly struck the Brigadier Gen.

PUPPET TEOFILO SISON 
CHARGED ON MANY COUNTS 

Teofilo Sison, former member 
of the puppet Laurel Cabinet and 
also of the Quezon Cabinet, is now 
under trial before the People's 
Court in Manila for treason and 
collaboration with the Japs. 'There 
arc about 30 charges against him. 
After his case is disposed of other 
’’big-shots’’ will be tried. 



WASHINGTON— Noting the 
preliminary conversations in Sali- 
nas, California about the possibil- 
ity of importing Filipino laborers 
from the Philippines for a stated 
number of years under contract, 
authorities here state that before 
such plan could be carried into 
effect a new law authorizing it 
will have to be enacted by Cong- 
ress. With Philppine bills pending 
in Congress, this is the time to 
take the matter up. ('The MAIL 
has made inquiries on the subject 
long before now and found * out 
that American union labor may 
oppose the plan, although not 
strongly because it’s farm labor 
that’s needed). 



NEW YORK- The Roy-Howard 
newspapers, reflecting their find- 
ings In the Philippines, state that 
General Maunel A, Roxas will 
surely defeat President Sergio Os- 
mena for President in the next 
election. The findings are impar- 
tial and have been reached after 
analyzing the different elements 
in the Filipino electorate. 

The people have completely lost 
its already wavering faith -in <Ds- 
mena. They believe that ho is not 
the man to lead them out of the 
wiledrness. They found Osmena 
doing the same political methods 
and manipulations that he used to 
do before the war. They found him 
everything but a man of action. 
He is suspicious to a degree that 
warps his judgment. And he does 
not possess the element of dyn- 
amic leadership. 

The Roy-Howard newspapers 
mention that Osmena vetoed the 
bill for the opening of local banks 
—the very bill that he himself 
ordered prepared and recommend- 
ed to the Congress. Somebody 
must have whispered in his ears 
about it and he made a complete 
turn-out. 

In Washington official circles 
the defeat of Osmena is expected 
and welcomed. His weakness, ac- 
cording to the official view, mi^ht 
cause a revolution in the Philip- 
pines, in which case the American 
Government will have to put it 
down. To that government this 
point is of the utmost importance. 
It does not want American soldiers

Women's Federation 
To Help Philippines 

WASHING'TON— The American 
Women’s Federation of Clubs an- 
nounced that it is eager to help 
In giving every help to the reor- 
ganization of the Philippines Wo- 
men's Federation. They have al- 
ready taken steps to raise a fund 
for the rebuilding of the home of 
the Federation in Manila which 
was burned by the Japanese. 

Mrs. Pilar H. Lim is still the 
head of the Philippine body, but 
its efficient Secretary, Mrs. Josefa 
Escoda (nee Miss Llanes) was ex- 
ecuted bir the Japs for helping 
American internees. Her husband 
who was on the staff of the “Man- 
ila Bulletin,” was also killed by 
the Japs, leaving two orphans. 



Before going to the East to continue lier Mtudies, MLvs Ruby Roxas, 
above, talented and pretty daughter of Senate President Manuel A. 
Roxas and candidate for President of the l*hilipplne Commonwealth, 
visited different Filipino Communities in California. Miss Roxas ar- 
rived In the mainland recently from the Philippines. She will enroll 
either at Wellesley College or Vos-sur College, c.xclusive Institution for 
women. 

Commonwealth Expiring 

November 15, 1945 is the 10th anniversary of the 
Philippine Commonwealth. It will be its last anniversary. 

It is expiring to give way, on July 4, 1946, to the Philip- 
pine Republic. 

Under the Commonwealth the Filipino people have 
self-government. They have an elected President and Cong- 
ress and they have a Constitution drafted by themselves. Al- 
though it is under the severeignity of the United States, it 
has in practice more liberty and independence than many of 
the technically independent nations of the w'orld. 

During the last ten years of the Commonwealth many 
good ideas have been exprejised by the government leaders. 
Among the greatest of them is Social Justice. But it has to 
be recorded as a fact that that idea has been more talked 
about than put into practice. That is w'hy the common peo- 
ple are in a state of mental revolt against the government 

And yet today the government leaders, although appear- 
ing in public in their shirt sleevc*s, are still keeping them- 
selves in the thick atmosphere of politics, especially petty, 
selfish politics. Social Justice has been forgotten. The peo- 
ple's well-being is neglected. The rich becomes richer and 
the poor poorer. The politician gets more power and the 
government becomes a menace to the people instead of an 
aid and protection. 

President Sergio Osmena is at the head of the govern- 
ment now. He is as political as ever — in thought, in 
method and in purpose. 

When the Republic is born, then the people will have a 
better opportunity to assert themselves and improve their 
government. Today if the people rise in armed revolt 
against the Commonwtalth government, they will have to 
face the American Government and Army. Tomorrow, 
when the Philippines becomes a Republic, then the Filipino 
people can deal with their government without fear of the 
might of the United States. They want justice from their 
government and they shall get it. A thousand Osmenas will 
not stop them. 

OSMENA-ROMULO ELECTIONEERING 



Pres. Osmena 
Returns To P. I. 



It will be denied, but it is never- 
theless absolutely true that Presi- 
dent Sergio Osmena and Resident 
Commissioner Carlos Romulo have 
spent much time in Washington 
mapping out the campaign for the 
re-election of Osmena. Among 
other things that they have decid- 
ed to, is to offer jobs to differ- 
ent Filipinos at big salaries appar- 
ently to w'ork in America l)ut in 
reality to help the Osmena cam- 
paign. 

Reports from Washington are 
that American government offi- 



cials are disgusted with these two 
officials because w-hen they are 
called in for conference they talk- 
ed in generalities and confine 
themselves to appeals when those 
officials want to hoar facte and 
information. The absolute truth is 
that Osmena and Romulo have no» 
spent much time studying the 
Philippine problems. Their ignor- 
ance of the problems, when details 
arc asked, is a great surprise to 
American officials. They ignore 
those Filipinos who know' those 
problems. 



SAN FRANCISCO — Nov. 17— 
After delivering his message to 
the Filipinos assembled at the 
California Legion of Honor, presi- 
dent Sergio Osmena flew to the 
Philippines. With him were Secre- 
tary of Finance Jaime Hernandez, 
Prof, Vicente Slnco and other 
ranking Filipino officials and his 
military aides. In the same plane, 
were Mrs. Aurora Aragon 
de Quezon, w’idow of the late 
President Manuel L. Quezon and 
her two daughters. Old Sergeant 
Ah Dong, the faithful servant of 
the Quezons is also included in 
the passenger list, 

J. C. Dionisio, Representative of 
the Western Division, Resident 
Commissioner’s Office wired all 
community presidents and Filipino 
newspaper editors and publishers 
and other leaders in CaUfomia to

tion.

body is already in existence, with 
lawyers, physicians and other pro- 
fessional men as leaders. 

Whether the American Fcdcni- 
tion of Labor will enter the Philip- 
pine field and help the organiza- 
tion of a local branch is not yet 
known. The participation of the 
American (?IO in Philippine labor 
affairs is going to be the beginning

ands.

hci*o, Gov. Tomas Confesor, is in- 
clined to the idea of staying in the 
United States more or less perm- 
anently, visiting only the Philip- 
pines from time to time. A group 
of Filipino leaders are thinking of 
launching Gov. Confesor’s candl- 
aacy for President of the Philip- 
pines, asserting that there is no 
Filipino who is more deserving of 
the honor. When the Governor left

L-d that he w'ould come back and

toral campaign is still young and

AN AMOUNT PAYABLE FOR WAR 
DAMAGES IN THE PHILIPPINES 

o 

Loss Estimate Is Over Eight Hundred 
Million Dollars, Amount May

WASHINGTON — The Senate Committee on Territories

Cabili Offers To 
Resign In Protest 
Of Lack Of Plan 



WASHINGTON — Ctol. Tomas 
Cabili has submittted his resigna- 
tion to President Osmena here. 
He told the President frankly and 
plainly that he came to Washing- 
ton to work and to serve the 
Philippines, but that he'found that 
there was no work, that there 

was no plan of w’ork and that 
everything was nebulous, confused 
and futile. 

The Colonel, whose civic cour- 
age and sincere patriotism are 
like fresh air in a dungeon, stated 
that he could get no intelligible 
information from Secretary Her- 
nandez or Commissioner Carlos 
Romulo and that the only thing 
certam w*as that vaat*Xftioums of 
government funds are being spent 
for salaries and allowances. He 
also said that the criticism levelled 
against the Commonwealth offic- 
ials here are mostly justified. 

Osmena refused to accept his 
resignation and told him there 
W'ould be a “reorganization” and 
that the personnel w'ould be chang- 
ed. Cabili had to look for w’ork 
because Gen. Romulo wanted to 
“hog everything for effect.”

E. C. Pecson's Place 

Is For Diplomacy 

If Attorney Evaristo P e c s o n

Congress, his friends and followers 
in his home province of Pangasin- 
an will only be too glad to vote for 
him. But he is not cut for the poli- 
tical arena with its rough and 
tumble fights. Mr. Pecson is the 
man for the diplomatic ser\'icc. 

When the Philippines becomes 
independent there will be a need 
for ambassadors, ministers and 
consuls. Mr. Pecson surely deserv- 
es to be considered for service in 
the diplomatic field. He is not look- 
ing for any government position, 
but hIs' government would be well 
advised if it invites a Filipino of

A book that promises to be most

The priest was the head of a

Japs destroyed. 



as to amount to be appropriated 
should have originated w’ith the 
House as the Constitution provides. 

Never In Doubt 

That the American Government 
will provide for the payment of 
war damages in the Philippines is 
never in doubt. Not a single voice 
has been raised against it. As a 
matter of fact, when Senator Tyd- 
ings mentioned $100,000,000 as the 
amount there was a chorus of op- 
inion that it was obriously too 
small and niggardly. The Senator 
himself stated that the amount 
was merely tentative and would 
depend on findings of fact. 

Osmena’s Failure 

The estimate of damages made 
by the War Damage Corporation, 
an American government agency 
is over $800,000,000, excluding 
damages lo ships, and their inves- 
tigations were not complete, as 
they themselves stated. 

President Sergio Osmena who 
has been here for two months 
should have w'orked harder and 
more effectively for a higher 
amount, and the consensus of op- 
inion is that the amount w'ould 
have been more than $500.(XX),000. 
once the decision to pay for dam- 
ages was made. 

The trouble is that President 
Osmena realized Uiat he has stay- 
ed in Washington too long and he 
wanted to return to Manila with 
“something” and so with $500,(X)0,- 
000 he could return in triumph, 
claiming that that w’as his w'ork, 
which everybody in Washington 
is not. 

Bill’s Other Provisions 

The Tydings omnibus bill pro- 
vides. besides the w'ar damages. 
$100,000,000 in surplus war mater- 
ials, a 20-year modifided, vanish- 
ing free- trade and training of Fili- 
pinos for certain industries and oc- 
cupations. President Osmena has 
as much to do with these things as 
the man in the moon.

it that after the decision was made 
to set the amount of w'ar damages 
at $500,000,000 a story appeared 
in the “Washington Post’’ giving 
the impression that It W'as through 
the sole work of Commissioner 
Romulo that the amount was in- 
creased. The information was trac- 
ed back to the publicity office of 
Gen. Romulo himself. Some Amer- 
ican Senators talked of issuing a 
formal statement denying the 
claim. 

-V Ignited Front 

It is felt by all good and patrio- 
tic Filipinos that there should be 
a united front in the work that is 
yet to be done, but Piesident Os- 
mena w'on't permit it because he 
wants to gel all credit even though 
the result is less. Political and per- 
sonal considerations should be eli- 
minated and the one and only con- 
sideration should be the w'cll-bo- 
ing of the Filipino people w'hich 
must not be subordinated to the 
personal ambitions of anyone. 
For Mr. Osmena’s re-election the 
Filipino people will pa>' plenty.

Senator Millard E. Tydings 

Senator Tydings will have more to do with the future of 
the Philippines than any other member of the United States 
Congress. He is the chairman of the Committee on Territor- 
ies and Insular Affairs. But he is more than that. He is one 
of the outstanding Senators. He is active, interested and 
amazingly well informed on different Philippine questions 
and problems. 

What manner of man is he? 

Senator Tydings is the public man who is hated most 
and feared most by Drew Pearson, that loud oratorical ac- 
cordion and journalistic nickelodeon who had been called a 
liar by the late President Roosevelt and many other high 
officials without curative effects upon him. But when he 
scratches Tydings’ skin, he gets from the Senator shafts of 
searing truths that send him reeling, rocking and rattling 
like a boxer after receiving the finishing soporific sock. Tyd- 
ings has a murderous wallop for deserving recipients. 

One day, at a Congressional committee hearings, a labor 
leader with an elephantiasis of the caput, otherwise known 
as a swell-head, talked as if he owned every member of 
Congress. Tydings stood as much as he could of his skull- 
duggeries and then gave him a verbal slashing that sent him 
into spirals and then stalked out of the room to dishonor his 
presence. The misguided labor elements afterwards con- 
demned the Senator and uttered punitive threats at the 
polls. When he thinks he is right, Tydings is afraid of no 
man or an aggregation of men. 

The usual admonition to any American, Filipino or 
Puerto Rican who addresses Tydings’ committee is: "Be 
careful 1 with what you say in the presence of Tydings — he’ll 
put you in the hole if you don’t say the right thing and he’ll 
polish you off like nobody’s business." The Senator reels off 
facts and figures in precise and smooth-flowing language 
that ofttimes appear that he knows more of the Puerto 
Rican problems than the Puerto Rican themselves and of 
the Philippine questions than the Filipinos. 

No one had had the gall to say "I know Tydings like a 
book, I know how his mind works, and I know which side 
his bread is buttered." No sane and honorable man can say 
that, for Tydings’ guide is his conscience, his sense of justice 
is invulnerable and his work tool is his keen intellect and 
his simple logic. 

Some business representatives who have not the courage 
to argue with Tydings publicly mutter privately that he "has 
a messiahnic complex when he is not just being deliberately 
mean." This comes chiefly from the Puerto Rican-American 
circles. But Filipinos don’t say that and don't think that, for 
they know that the Senator is factual and fair and so they 
prepare well before they decide to appear before his com- 
mittee, and as a result they get along with him better. 

A few months ago President Truman sent Tydings with 
a committee of ten high officials to have a look-see in the 
Philippines. After a few days in Manila Tydings said, 
"Gentlemen, tomorrow we’ll fly back to Washington," and 
they flew b^ck. Critics said Tydings proved that he was 
moody, eccentric and authoritarian. However, those who 
knew the Senator said that he was being nothing of the 
kind and that he was a man who could understand a situ- 
ation quickly and make decisions to fit the situation and, 
without ado, acts accordingly. Tydings is efficient mentally 
and actionally. 

Tydings is a real leader, intellectually, politically and 
temperamentally. He is a mechanical engineer and a lawyer. 
He hds a happy family life. He is a hard worker and a fight- 
er. He is just and fair. It is a fortunate thing for the Philip- 
pines that Senator Millard E. Tydings of the free State of 
Maryland is the head of the committee that will, with the 
cooperation of the House committee, prepare the blueprint 
for the Philippine independent nation.

American Emperors 

Today the great General Douglas MacArthur is called 
affectionately as "Emperor Mac of Japan. His power, 
which overtops the power of Emperor Hirohito, justifies 
that appellation. And his formidable appearance, made hu- 
man by his tremendous corn-cob pipe, makes him every inch 
imperial and regal and, ah, a grand American. 

His work in Japan is, without a scintilla of doubt, the 
most delicate the most dangerous, the most unprecedented 
and the most epoch-making that has been given any man in 
the entire history of the world. To make defeat and surrend- 
er real to 100,000,000 fanatics, super-nationalisps and peo- 
ple of radically different mental processes has been the re- 
sponsibility of MacArthur. That responsibility he discharged 
with a success that is truly incredible and marks him as a 
man that belongs to the centuries and to all countries. 

The time will come when his work wjll be at an end 
and a new phase of Japanese relationships with her victors 
will be inaugurated. That phase will be the political and 
economic life of the Japanese people. It will decide what 
the future of Japan will be — whether she will be a peace- 
ful or a militaristic nation and whe*ther she will eventually 
be a menace to the peace of the world. 

The successor of General MacArthur must be a man of 
many abilities and excellent qualifications. Paul V. McNutt 
will receive preferential consideration. He will make a good 



By VICENTE VILLAMIN 

Supplementing the other pro- 
grams for the rehabilitation and 
reconstruction of the Philippines, 

I wish to present a series of sug- 
gestions by which the Congress of 
the United States could help the 
Philippines tremendously without 
appropriating money. 

Since the beginning of the war 
up to the present time the Amer- 
ican government and members of 
the American forces have spent in 
the Philippines well over $500,000,- 
000 and, with the liquidation of 
outstanding obligations, this am- 
ount will increase to approximate- 
ly $600,000,000, an estimate which 
has been arrived at in collabor- 
ation with experts. 

That money is in the Philippines 
today and is mostly in the hands 
of hundreds of thousands of Fili- 
pinos. That is good money. That is 
money for which people will work 
and produce to acquire. In fact, it 
is the most powerful incentive to- 
day for Filipinos to get busy. 
True, it raised the prices of things 
temporarily, but it is not the cause 
of the scarcity of those things. At 
present, following tlic Gresham 
law in political economy that bad 
money drives out good money, that 
national nest egg is not much in 
evidence, but it is there with its 
tremendous potentiality for use 
and development. 

That amount is far and away 
the greatest monetary accumul- 
ation that has ever existed at any 
time in the Philippines in all its 
400 years of recorded history. And 
it is clean and unencumbered. . It 
is 2% times the dollar value of our 



and the Philippines and its impact 
upon our economic life. 

Filipinos Getting Poorer 

During the 5-year period im- 
mediately preceding the war we 
sold the United States $640,000,000 
worth of products, mostly raw 
materials through manufacturing; 
and we bought $600,000,000 worth, 
chiefly finished goods, which went 
to direct consumption. Statistical- 
ly, therefore, we were $40,000,000 
to the good. But that is more ap- 
parent than real. 

The $600,000,000 worth of goods 
we imported cost the Filipino con- 
sumers about $750,000,000, after 
adding thereto the importer’s and 
distributor’s profits, transporta- 
tion, financing and other charges. 
Per contra, the $640,000,000 worth 
of products which we exported gave 
us a net proceeds of only about 
$530,000,000, after deducting 
therefrom freight, insurance, fin- 
ancing, selling and other burdens. 
In other words, during that 5-year, 
period we were in the red to the 
extent of $220,000,000, which luck- 
ily was worked down by our ex- 
ports of gold and silver bulion, 
especially the former, to roughly 
$100,000,000. To emphasize the 
real significance of these figures 
to Philippine economy, ft should be 
stated that those who handle our 
imports and exports and their im- 
molate incidence are not Fili- 
pinos. 

Philippine Economy Unsound 

It is obvious that if we don’t 
give a new direction to our econ- 
omic affairs and do something else 
besides depending on our overseas 
trade, however vitally important 



annual national production. It is 4 that is, particulary our trade with 



times the normal monetary circu- 
lation. Based on comparative na- 
tional incomes, it is as if the sum 
of 85 billion dollars has been added 
to the total annual income of 160 
billion dollars of the American 
people. 

Producer-Consumer Economy 

The challenge is how' to keep 
that money in the country and 
mdke it both the foundational and 
the functional base of a new pro- 
ducer-consumer economy that 
exists today only in the thinnest 
and leanest condition. A vital, vib- 
rant producer-consumer economy 
is the most imperative need of our 
country. It will cause a recession^ 
in our altogether too heavy a de- 
pendence on overseas markets, 
with over 70% of total production 
being exportable surplus as com- 
pared to only 69r of that of the 
United States and approximately 
50% of that of the United King- 
dom, which proclaims that it has 
to export goods in order to live. It 
is, indeed, the kind of economy 
that will give us economic as well 
as political stability, real wide- 
spread prosperity and a diversified 
agricultural production balanced 
with a rational industrialization. 

Before intimating to you what I 
believe Congress could do in the 
realm of legislation to help build 
that producer-consumer economy, 
I wish to give a synthesis of the 
trade between the United States 



the United^ States, we will find 
ourselves living in a fool’s paradise 
indeed, with the people existing 
from hand to mouth and unable to 
get ahead and the government, 
with its increasing expensiveness, 
tending to aggravate the lot of the 
people. 

'The most tragic part of it all is 
that our trade relations with 
foreign countries places us in the 
red more emphatically than our 
trade with the United States. If 
not for our trade with the United 
States we would be wallowing in 
the most intense poverty that 



coming from the United States to 
the'" same extent as those from 
foreign countries. We shall use 
thK power to place embargo im- 
port duties on all luxuries and 
^fUer commodities that are not 
e^ential to the plan of national 
economic construction and renov- 
ation. 

At the same time we shall admit 
du^y free from the United States 
all sorts of agricultural and indus- 
trial tools and equipments as well 
as other articles that would be 
used to modernize our productive 
apparatus and prosesses, create 
many small industries and small 
businesses, create new occupations 
and trades, create greater econ- 
omic-mindedness, create clearer 
knowledge of the country’s possi- 
bilities, and generally open up new 
opportunities, new horizons and 
new interpretations of real patri- 
otism and constructive service to 
the country. 

Secondly, as a complement to 
the first suggestion, I submit that 
Congress make it possible by legis- 
lation to permit us, say for the 
first ten years following the date 
of Philippine independence, to con- 
tinue selling to the world’s best 
market, the United States, and to 
buy as much of our requirements 
as\|)ossible from the inexpensive 
markets elsewhere. This %vill en- 
able us to secure real favorable 
balance and intrench us economic- 
ally in a strong manner. It will 
give Filipinos an opportunity to 
enter in the foreign and domestic 
trade of their country. 

After those ten years, with en- 
hanced buying power and wider 
needs for goods and services, the 
Philippine-American trade could 
be re-established on a reciprocal 
basis. At that time, instead of a 
trade of approximately $200,000,- 
000 a year between them, that 
trade would go up to the billion- 
dollar level. And when that level 
is reached that trade would still 
be lower than the Cuban level, on 
the per capita compartive basis, 
which points to better prospects 
and greater possibilities. I, there- 
fore, wish to stress the point that 
what might be lost in America’s 
exports to the Philippines would 



u * V be more than regained in a few 

would neutralize our progress in ® , 

.nu..,; «h.- *he 10-year period; and 



government, in culture and edu- 
cation. 

These recitals suggest that our 
economy is fqr from sound. They 
also insistently suggest that with 
the steadying and supporting hand 
of the United States we must and 
we can make it sound. 'This is the 
strategic time to do it when we 
are starting from scratch — from 
zero productibn and from zero re- 
activation. Verily, we need a new 
economy and a new economy we 
must have if our country is to en- 
dure as a strong nation. 

Some Remedies Suggested 
My suggestions for the consider- 
ation of the United States Con- 
gress are the following: 

Firstly, invest the Philippine 
government with the power to im- 
pose import duty on certain goods 



"Emperor Mac II." He is at present the U. S. High G)mmis- 
sioner to the Philippines. But he will relinquish that posi- 
tion when that country becomes an independent nation on 

July 4, 1946. 

There is only one thing that will be mentioned against 
McNutt. During the war he stated that the Japanese should 
be "exterminated to toto." But that’s one of those hyperboles 
that are used to pep up the people and was not meant liter- 
ally. McNutt will make a good "Emperor Mac" intellectual- 
ly and pictorially. 

o 

The British In Java 

Press dispatches report everyday of the British military 
operations in Java. More and more people are asking, Why 
are the British fighting the Indonesions — the natives of 
Java? The question will be asked from to doomsday and the 
British, we daresay, will never be able to answer it satisfac- 
torily. 

Java is a Dutch, not a British colony. The Indonesians 
want their independence from the Dutch and they are fight- 
ing for it. But the Brftish, not the Dutch, are fighting them. 
Is this not as amazing as it is significant? 

There must be an understanding between the Dutch 
and the British. If the Dutch are as friendly and helpful to 
the Indonesians as they so insistently say, why don't they 
deal with them direct and why, on the contrary, do they al- 
low them to be attacked and slaughtered by the British? 

All the peoples of the Orient are interested in this most 
bewildering spectacle. It is said that the British, as sovereign 
in extensive areas4n the Orient, are interested in suppressing 
what they term as lawlessness in any part of the Orient. The 
Indonesians are fighting for their independence as the Am- 
ericans fought the British in the 17th century for their in- 
dependence. Supposing other peoples of the Orient should 
come to the aid of the Indonesians, as the British have come 
to the aid of the Dutch in Java, the result will be a general 

conflagration in the entire Orient. 

We of the Philippines are watching rather helplessly 

but with a rising interest what’s going to happen in Java 
and what precedent will be established by it. We are going 
to.be an independent nation. We are lucky we have the con- 
sent and blessing of the United States of America. Oother- 
wise, the British might "Indonize” us. 



^ anv* making this point with the 
thought that, with greater pur- 
chases by the Philippines of non- 
luxury and non-essential commod- 
ities, there would be gain rather 
than loss even during the first ten 
years. My plea, therefore, is for 
Congress to give us a running 
start of ten years after independ- 
ence and let us place our economy 
on a much stronger and broader 
base than where it is at present. 

A Domestic Plan Needed 
It is, of course, necessary to 
complement and supplement this 
program with policies by the 
Philippine government making 
effective the organization of a new 
producer-consumer economy. To 
that end I shall submit to that 
government, if it will accept it 
from a private Filipino citizen who 
desires to serve his country out- 
side of the government service, 
the results of my studies in com- 
parable problems in foreign coun- 
tries, especially England, and the 
niost illuminating American econ- 
omic-social experiment in Puerto 



omic- 

Rico. 



Our aspiration is to begin the 
liquidation of the incredible pov- 
erty of the Filipino people. With 
the benefits of the American tax- 
exempt market, besides the direct 
expenditures of the American 
Government and the indirect sav- 
ings and advantages, the income of 



the Filipino family of 4 avereaged 
only $75 a year, about $20 of 
which went to taxes*. We shudder 
when we talk of the unspeakable 
poverty of the Chinese people, but 
the average income of a Chinese 
family of 5 is about $90 a year, 
and they pay less taxes than the 
Filipinos. 

I will have by now convinced 
you that I favor the continuation 
of the Philippine-American trade 
on a preferential basis, and that is 
not Incompatible with the idea of 
a new producer-consumer econ- 
omy. Our trade with the United 
States is a going concern, outside 
of war interference, and the source 
of our present income. What I am 
suggesting is that we build and 
fortify our domestic economy and 
thus reduce relatively our undue 
and uneconomic dependence on 
overseas markets. This does not 
necessarily signify the diminution 
of that trade but, on the contrary, 
its possible expansion through the 
vertical and horizontal expansion 
of Philippine economic activities. 

Perpetual Trade Relations 

I shall now discuss the thesis 
that the Philippine-American trade 
relations after independence should 
not be restricted to a period of 
years but should co-exi5t with the 
American military position in the 
Philippines, and that means in per- 
petuity. 

Today the Philippine-American 
relationship flows from the fact 
that the United States is political- 
ly sovereign in the Philippines. 
After the sundering of the politic- 
al bonds with the declaration of 
political independence, that rela- 
tionship will arise from the fact 
that the United States will have a 
special, exclusive military position 
there. The military motivation is 
as strong and compelling as the 
political motivation, and its effects 
on the national and inter-national 
position of the Philippines are as 
pervasive and overwhelming. To- 
day the Philippines is a self-gov- 
erning Commonwealth and protec- 
ted; tomorrow we shall be a Re- 
public and a protectorate. In other 
words, the base of the relation- 
ship of the two countries will be 
shifted from the political to the 
military, which in its practical 
operation would be like differenti- 
ating between tweedledee and 
tweedledum. 

With the establishment of first- 
class naval and air bases and their 
territorial appurtenances in the 
Philippines, the spearhead of Am- 
erica’s strategic plan in the Pacific 
will not be Pearl Harbor in Hawaii 
anymore, but the Philippines, 5,- 
000 miles beyond towards the Asia- 
tic mainland. 'The main idea of 
this, as I understand it, is that in 
case of war the battle-ground 
would be, far from the American 
mainland, with a better chance of 
intercepting enemy attacks near; 
their points of departure. 

Philippine Republic Is Protectorate 
Do we realize the full signific- 
ance of the special military posi- 
tion of the United States in an 
independent nation like the future 
Philippine Republic ? It means that 
the Philippines, whether it likes it 
or not, will be involved in any war 
in the Pacific in which the United 
States is a belligerent. It means 
the self-violation by the Philli>- 
pines by provision of an American 
law of its international neutrality, 
making it incongruous to carry 
out the plan for the perpetual 
neutarlization of the Philippines 
under Section 11 of the Act of 
Congress of March 24, 1934, the 
Philippine Independence Act. It 
means, finally, a clear notice to all 
nations of the earth that between 



the United States and the Philip- 
pines there is an unwritten mili- 
tary alliance, understanding or co- 
oirdination. 

These obvious effects should 
make it powerful logical that 
the United States should be inter- 
ested in having the Philippines 
strong, prosperous and friendlj# 
The commercial relations between 
the two countries, besides being a 
binding force between them, are 
a great aid in creating that condi- 
tion. If those relations are estab- 
lished presently and then disestab- 
lished 20 years hence on the theory 
of effecting economy readjustment 
and achieving economic independ- 
ence — a twin inapplicable con- 
cepts — the result would be the dis- 
integration of the military rela- 
tions with the improverishment 
and debilitation of the Filipino 
people. The sequel would be the 
defeat of the American foreign 
policy in the Western Pacific as 
chiefly implemented by the pres- 
ence of American major military 
establishments in the Philippines. 

Parallel cases will undoubtedly 
be cited to refute this interpreta- 
tion of the post-independence mili- 
tary position of the United States 

in the Philippines. 

Mentions British Position — 

It may be stated, for instance, 
that American canal of immehse 
strategic importance is located in 
the Republic of Panama, and there 
is no free trade between Panama 
and the United States. The ans- 
wer to that is that the United 
States assumed with respect to that 
country a much greater commit- 
ment than a mere free trade ar- 
rangement. Article I of the Isth- 
mian Canal 'lYeaty of November 
18, 1943, popularly known as the 
Hay-Bunau Varilla treaty, reads 
as follows: “The United States 
guarantees and will maintain the 
independence of the Republic of 



Panama." That all-inclusive Arti- 
cle was in effect for 33 years. It 
was superseded, pursuant fo’^t 
Good Neighbor Policy, by the 
Treaty of Friendship and Cooper- 
ation of March, 1936 between the 
two countries. No one will be naive 
States will be indifferent in a situ- 
enough to think that the United, 
ation where the Panamanian inde- 
pendence and especially its terri- 
torial integrity are in danger. 

Again, it may be said that the 
granting of trade preference to an 
independent Philippines would be 
inconsistent with the international 
policy enunciated in Section 7 of 
the Lend-Lease master agreemenf 
between the United States on the 
one side and Great Britain and 
Soviet Russia severally on the 
other under which trade barriers, 
preferences and discriminatory 
policies shall be done away with 
as consistently and comprehensive- 
ly as possible. It seems to me tha 
the answer is that, regardless 0 
legalistic niceties and diplomatic 
ameneties, the Philippines will 
virtually be an American protecto? 
rate. Therefore, as British Empir|Lf 
preference between the United 
Kingdom and one of its protect 
torates is in order and not viola- 
♦ivn nf that 7 yq will tradp 





preference between the Uni' 
States and the Philippines would 
be in order. S 

Under the Statute of Wesi 
ster, the organic law of the BriP 
ish Commonwealth of Natioi 
each member has both diplomal 
and tariff independence and each^ 
can enter into trade agreemeni 
with foreign countries and Empi 
preferences is subject to that facLj 
Under the plan in Title II of

New War Damage Arguments 

Will Be Urged By Villamin 



WASHINGTON— When the Phi- 
lippine bill is taken up by the 
House committee on insular af- 
fairs, Mr. Vicente Villamin, econo- 
mist, will, in his own words, “start 
% 

a new train of thought on the war 
damage question that will prove 
that $500,000,000 is far from suf- 
ficient to meet the war damages.” 
He stated that those who sus- 
tained losses from December 7, 
1941, to July 1, 1942, have acquired 
vested right to the full payment 
under the decision of the Recon- 
struction Finance Corporation, ap- 
proved by the President of the 
United States and the, appropriate 
committees of Congress. 

The amount of damages In that 
category, according to the War 
Damage Corporation, a subsidiary 
of the RFC. is $305,000,000. That 
leaves $195,000,000 to meet the 
damages caused after July 1, 1942 
to the end of the war in 1945. 

Then Mr. Villamin stated that, 
according to the same source, the 
damages in the city of Manila 
alone amount to around $150,000,- 
000, leaving “the bagatelle of $45,- 
000,000 to liquidate the damages 
suffered outside of Manila.” 

So he said that it is crystal clear 
that the amount of $50O,000;000 Is 
totally inadequate. He mentioned 
the fact that the War Damage 
Corporation estimated the total 
losses at $800,000,000 outside of 
damages to vessels, adding that 
the Corporation investigators who 
went to Manila were not able by 
the very nature of things and by 
the brevity of time to make a com- 
plete survey of the damages caused 
in all parts of the country. 

Mr. Vallamin expressed the be- 
lief that the just and practical way 



of approaching the damage ques- 
tion is to leave out the damages 
before July 1, 1942, which are pay- 
able in full, starting with the $1Q0, 
000,000 mentionted by the RFC in 
its statement of December 22, 1^, 
and let the new legislation and 
appropriation apply to the dam- 
ages sustained aher July 1, 1942 
to the end of the war. 

OSMENA OFFERS 
MRS. P. H. LIM 
POSITION 



: MAILBOX : 



MILITARY 

NEWSGRAMS 



Col. Salvador Abccde, guerrilla 
leader, is about to finish his course 
at the Staff and Command School, 
Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas. 



Major Jesus Villamor is resign- 
ing from the Army. He will soon 
be returning to the Philippines. 



Former Chief of Staff Gen. 
Basilio J. Valdes is on the War 
Crimes Commission trying Jap war 
criminals. 



Filipino West Point graduates 
want to see a West Pointer as 
Chief of Staff of the Philippine 
Army. That was Gen. MacArthur's 
plan. 



A group of Filipino officers will 
visit West Point, their alma mater, 
and other military educational in- 
stitutions to get new ideas for the 
Philippine Military Academy at 
Bagmio. They are Col. Punsalan, 
Capt. Atanacio Chavez, Capt. Flor 
Cruz and Lt. Rafael Ileto. 



Major Leopoldo Martellno, quar- 
termaster corps, has returned to 
Manila after taking a course at 
Camp Lee, Virginia. 



Capt. Edmundo Navarro has 
sailed for home after attending the 
Infantry School at Ft. Benning, 
Georgia. 



Col. Rafael Jalandoni, who lAay 
be the next Chief of Staff, has not 
been to the United States. He has 
a natural flair for intelligence and 
police work. 



Filipinos are advised not to get 
shocked if President Osmena ap- 
points Gen. Carlos P. Romulo as 
Chief of Staff. (Then the Army 
disbands!) 



WASHINGTON— Mrs. Pilar H. 
Lim, former member of the Philip- 
inc Rehabilitation Commission, has 
left with her family for Los An- 
geles, where she will live before 
returning to the Philippines. 

Since she left she was the sub- 
ject of talk and speculation in the 
Commonwealth office. “Will she 
accept tho new position that Presi- 
dent Osmena offered her?” is the 
question everyone is asking. 

The exact nature of the position 
is not known, but it is believed 
that Osmena wants the Filipino 
voters, especially the women, to 
know that Mrs. Pilar Lim, who is 
very popular among them, is with 
him. It is all Inconn'ecrion with^he 
coming elections in which Osmena 
fears he might get defeated by 
Gen. Manuel Roxas. 

Gen. Carlos Romulo, the Resi- 
dent Commissioner, is Osmena’s 
political and campaign adviser, ac- 
cording to those near to both of 
them. It was understood that Gen. 
Romulo saw clearly that Mrs. Lim 
was a big political asset and so 
advised President Osmena. 

“Osmena is groggy and he 
doesn't know what to do,” a Fili- 
pino official was heard as saying, 
“but he will do anything to get 
himself elected, and if the appoint- 
ment of Mrs. Lim to a govern- 
ment position will do that, he will 
offer her a good-paying job.” 

Mrs. Lim, outside of political 
considerations, could be very use- 
ful to the Philippines in the United 
States, but her friends and admir- 
ers fear that she might find her- 
self in the midst of politics tied 
up to Osmena, who is generally 
considered ,due for defeat in tb^ 
next elections. 

What everyone is asking is why 
Osmena got the bright idea of ai>- 
pointing Mrs. Lim when the Philipn 
pine questions in Congress are al- 
ready advanced and when she was 
already about to leave Washing- 
ton. After the Congress passes the 
bills, what is she going to do? 
This is the same question to other 
Filipino officials. The smell of poli- 
tics is too strong. The Roxas men 
have already smelt it. — A. M. 



Worcester Assigned 

Jap Reparations 

WASHINGTON — High Com- 
missioner Paul V. McNutt has as- 
signed one of his aides, Fritz Wor- 
cester, to look after the possibility 
of the Philippines receiving some 
materials and industries from 
Japan as reparations. This matter 
is considered as having tremndous 
possibilities for the reconstruction 
of the Philippines. (It is under- 
stood that it was Mr. Vicente Vil- 
lamin who wrote the memorandum 
on the subject which the American 
Reparations Mission brought with 
it to Japan).

the Sierra Nevada, the word "Sleiv

ence to the jagged peaks of the

A Letter To 
Gen. Manuel A. Roxas 
Manila, Philippines. 

(In Tagalog) 

Heneral Rojas: 

Naku, Heneral, marami pong 
basagulu sa Washington. Marami 
pong calabasa doon. Nombrahan 
ninyon si Mang Manuel Abella na 
agent at Malalaman ninyo ang 
lahat na nangyayari. Si Manuel po 
ay binigyan nang isang puntapie ni 
Mang Jayme Emandes at pinalipad 
sa hangin. 

Heneral, tunay po ba na cayo ay 
a pabor cay Mang Carlos Romolo 
como Come-Cionado ? Sinasabi po 
ni Mang Carlos no sia ay nagbibi- 
gay nang malaking pabor pagtang- 
ap nang puesto, Naku, isang mal- 
aking calocohan po kung tunay ito. 
(Hindi tunay yan — Roxas). Pag 
discursohan si Mang Carlos po ay 
parang sill pasiti. Naku, cay init 
Cay hanghang. 

Si Mang Tomas Compesor po ay 
hindi cayo ina-atake. Si mang 
Tomas ay narini po sa Calipornia. 
Si Mang Tomas Cabili ay na sa 
Wasington. Bakit po, Heneral, hin- 
di ninyo invitahin si Mang Tomas 
Cabili para Vice-Presidente sa iny- 
on tikit? Pihong piho na tatalun- 
in ninyo ang Presidente Osmena. 

Si Mang Carlos po ay candldafo 
para Presidente nang Compede- 
racion Malayo. Ang Vice-Presi- 
dente po ay si Doctor Sokarno, da- 
tapuat po ay ang Doctor ay tum- 
iguil na sa paglaban. Canya po is 
Mang Carlos ay marahil ay mag- 
ing Ghandi Pilipino. Itanung po 
ninyo kay Mang Carlos kung sia ay 
Ck>me-Clonado o C!andidato para 
Pangulo nang Compederacion. Adi- 
os po, Heneral. 

(Translation) 

General Roxas: 

Gee, General, there are plenty 
trouble in Washington. Plenty of 
failures there. Appoint Mr. Man- 
uel Abella as your agent and you 
will know everything. Manuel was 
given a stiff kick by Mr. Jaime 
Hernandez which made him fly in- 
to the air. 

General, is it true that you are 
in favor of Mr. Romulo as Resi- 
dent CJommissioner? Mr. Romulo 
says that he is giving a great favor 
in accepting the position. Gee, that 
would be a great foolishness if it 
is true (It ain’t true — Roxas). 
When it comes to speech-making, 
Mr. Romulo is like green j>epper. 
Oh, so hot. 

Mr. Tomas Confesor does not at- 
tack you. He is here in California. 
Mr. Tomas Cabili Is in Washing- 
ton. Why don’t you, General, in- 
vite Mr. Tomas Cabili to be the 
Vice-President on your ticket? It 
will be absolutely sure you will 
beat President Osmena. 

Mr. Carlos Romulo is a candi- 
date for President of the Malayan 
C!onfcderation. The Vice-President 
is Doctor Sakamo, but the Doctor 
quit fighting. So Mr. Carlos may 
become the Filipino Ghandi. Please 
ask him whteher he is our Resi- 
dent Commissioner or a candidate 
for President of the Federation. 
Good bye, General.

An Ideal Place To Spend 
Your Dull Moments 



WASHINGTON - Filipinos and 
American business men are now 
separate and divided.^That has 
been observed during the consider- 
ation of Philippine bills. 

Americans do not see Filipinos 
and do not want to see them. They 
have their owm game. It is all a 
deep secret. Tlie Filipinos are made 
to feel that they have to watch 
them so they don't have provisions 
in the bills that will help only 
themselves. 

But they are up against it be- 
cause the American Goverenment 
wants to help the Filipinos, especi- 
ally the poor people who lost their 
property and their bread-winners 
in the war. The Americans have 
already convinced everyone that 
they want relief for themselves 
first. They are the big business 
interests whose factories and busi- 
nesses have been partially or whol- 
ly destroyed. People are already 
saying that if they are going to be 
paid for their losses, then wars 
will not be disadvantageous to 
businessmen. 

Prominent among the Americans 
whom Filipinos are watching in 
distrust and in disgust are Lucien 
Mercier, who represents the Philip- 
pine-American Chamber of Com- 
merce of New York, a lawyer who 
has n^t been in the Philippines and 
who knows but very little of 
Philippine problems; and Carl Jao 
obson, who represents the Calam- 
ba Sugar Estate, the Spreckles 
sugar interests and the Hawaiian 
sugar interests in the Philippines. 

Neither Mercier nor Jacobson 
appeared before Congressionl com- 
mittees to give their views publicly 
so they could be known to all and 
discussed. But observers are al- 
it?ady saying that their work is 
really nil if not negative. In so far 
as Filipinos are concerned, they 
are giving other Americans a bad 
name and are misrepresenting 
them, for after all most of the 
American businessmen in th6 
Philppines are fin, upstanding men 
wliom Filipinos like and respect. 

With Mercier and Jacobson re- 
presenting the American business 
interests, the Filipinos are forced 
to be on their guard and they will 
be on their guard. 'They have al- 
ready so reported to American 
government officials. 



.WASHINGTON— There is one 
American who is always for and 
with the Filipinos. He is Judge 
John W. H^ussermann, the leading 
gold miner in the Philippines. 

As long as “the Judge” is around 
the Filipinos can expect a square 
deal at any and all times. He is 
the best and sincerest friend the 
Filipinos have among Americans 
in the Philippines. 

In these times of misery and 
suffering he is interesting himself 
in how the American Government 
could give real and speedy relief 
to the Filipino people. He wants 
the Filipinos to get compensation 
for war damages. He is for them 
first, last and all the time. He 
is different from the Other Amer- 



icans. 

One day he was host at his hotel 
suite to Filipinos, both officials 
and private individuals. Besides be- 
ing an excellent host, he was good- 
will, cordiality and frankness per- 
sonified, which are his natural 
gifts. The Filipinos were very 
pleasantly impressed. For most of 
them that was the first time they 
had met the famous man. 

Col. Tomas Cabili, former mem- 
ber of President Osmena’s Cabinet 
and guerrilla leader in Mindanao, 
and Major Pedro Lopez, member 
of the Philippine Congress and the 
Philippine Rehabilitation Commis- 
sion, said after the luncheon that 
they were very happy to have met 
and heard Judge Haussermann. 

Major Jesus Villamor, the No. 
1 Filipino ace and holder of the 
Congressional Medal of Honor, and 
Mrs. Pilar H. Lim, wife of Gener- 
al Vicente Lim, were also happy 
to meet the Judge. 

Judge Haussermann gave a talk. 

Senator Harry Hawes 
Is Missed At Hearings 



a most interesting talk, about his 
“business family” of 10,000 work- 
er^ — really 50,000 with their fami- 
lies — which had his guests in rapt 
attention. 

iv6*. Vicente Villamin and Dr. 
^gpiott, adviser to High Commis- 
sioner McNutt and former Presi- 
dent <jf Purdue University, joined 
the gathering after the luncheon.

Senator Chavex Is 
Friend Of Philippines 

WASHINGTON — One of the 
most sincere and untiring friends 
of the Philippines in Congress is 
the distinguished Senator from 
New Mexico, Hon. Dennis Chavez. 
The Senator does not miss meet- 
ings of the committee and he fol- 
lows the testimony and discussions 
closely. He entered the Senate in 
1935 after service in the House and 
in the State Legislature. He is a 
lawyer, a graduate of Georgetown

stay there. 



WASHINGTON— 'The friend of 
the Philippines whose face has not 
been seen at the Congressional 
committee hearmgs is former Sen- 
ator Harry B. Hawes. His absence 
was missed. He is the one of all 
American legal representatives 
who could talk authoritatively for 
the Philippines and make a pro- 
found impression on Members of 
Congress. . a 

The Senator is well advanced ia 
years, but he is not advanced en- 
ough in that cannection to keep 
him out of any Philippine discus- 
sions in Congress. The Philippine 
government and private interests 
should have asked him to speak to 
the committees of Congress, 

The American representatives 



WASHINGTON— After hearing 
many complaints aginst Dr. M. 
Kalaw, President Osmena, instead 
of sending him back to Manila, 
glorified him by sending him to 
London, England to represent the 
Philippines at the meetings of the 
United Nations. 

Solomon Arnaldo, of the Com- 
monwealth permanent staff, ac- 
companied Dr. Kalaw as “technic- 
al adviser.” The two men will have 
a look-see and have a good time in 
London town. Like Secretary Jai- 
me Hernandez, they may go also 
to Paris (with perdiems) to see 
tbe gpings-on at Montparnasse and 
^ the, Nontmart. 

>r. ^Calaw was a delegate to the 
lO at San Francisco which 
created the United Nations. After 
a short time he got tired of the 
conference and left for Washing- 
ton and New York. He didn’t sign 
the World Charter. When th^y 
asked him in London “Where’s 
your signature here?” what could 
he reply? 

He was in Quebec, Canada to 
represent the Philippines at an- 
other conference — food and agri- 
culture. What happened to that? 
Is the Philippines going to get 
some benefits from all these repre- 
sentations which, cost loads of 
money ? 

All the time the status of Dr. 
Kalaw, whether he is a collabor- 
ationist or not, has been raised by 
Filipino guerrillas. They want him 
ip Manila to answer any inuendoes 



Bernstein Not 
Right Man For 
Public Relations 

Dave Bernstein is getting around 
$10,(XX) a year as public relations 
officer of the Philippine Common- 
wealth in Washington? 

Filipinos are unanimous in say- 
ing that he is not the right man 
for the position and he is being 
paid too much. If President Os- 
mena wants a good man, he could 
have the pick among experienced 
and upstanding American writers, 
correspondents or public-relations 
men. But Bernstein is not the man. 

From whqt Filipinos on the 
Coast hear from Filipino employ- 
ees in the Commonwealth, Dave 
Bernstein is one of these men who 
think he knows it all and who go 
about mysteriously to give the 
impression that he was doing some 
heavy thinking. They also say that 
his knowledge of Philippine affairs 
is superficial. 

President (Dsmena has been get- 
ting a very poor press. What’s 
Dave Bernstein been doing? He 
was believed to be well connected 
with some of the newspaper F>eo- 
ple, especially the so-called liberal 
ones. There are no Philippine items 
in the newspapers from Bern- 
stein’s office. His releases are 
stale, untimely and uninteresting. 

Dave Bernstein is a real luxury 
for the Philippine government 
Miss Gladys Beauchamp is more 
useful than him at less than half 
his salary. (Miss Gladys, please 
take a bow).

on the operation of the principle 
of the most-favored- nation and 
import sugar into the United duty 
free like the Philippine sugar. We 
wish Cuba success if she can con- 
vince Uncle Sam. With more pros- 
perity we hope she will permit our 
sugar industry to live and to be in 
peace. 

However, our answer to the 
possible representations of Cuba 
under the most-favored-nation 
principle will be the case of Cuba 
itself. By virtue of the politico- 
military relationship between Cuba 
and the United States predicated 
on the declaration contained in the 
joint resolution of the U. S. Cong- 
ress of April 28, 1898, and carried 
out by the treaties of December 
11, 1902 and of May 22, 1903 the 
Republic of Cuba and the United 
States established a modified pref- 
erential trade arrangement under 
which Cuban products received 
preferential rates of 20% and 
more. An American naval station 
was established at Guantanamo, a 
part of the Cuban territory. The 
so-called Platt Amendment was in- 
corporated in the Cuban Constitu- 
tion, which was withdrawn, again 
under the Good Neighbor Policy, 
by the treaty of Cuban-American 
relations of May 29, 1934. The 
Cuban preferential, modified by 
trade agreements to be sure, has 
been going on for over 42 years 
and there is no limit to its dur- 
ation, evidently being coterminous 
with the existence of America’s 
special military position in Cuba 
as indicated by the naval station 
at Guantanamo. 

What interests us profoundly, if 
we are not in error, is that the 
tariff preference granted to Cuba 
was not granted to other countries 
on the solid ground that whenever 
there is. a special political or mili- 
tary relations between two signa- 
tories to a commercial treaty, the 
principle of the most-favored-na- 
tion does not apply. The case of 
the Philippines would seem to be 
on all fours with Cuba, with the 
difference that our px>litical rcla-

tions with the United States arc 
much closer and longer and the 
strategic interests of this country 
in the Pacific is much more vast 
and vital than in the Carribean. 

Economic Re-equllbration 
Once you have adopted the phil- 
osophy that the prefential trade 
relations b e t w' e e n the United 
States Is in order and should co- 
exist with their military relation- 
ship, the reconcilement of the pro- 
visions of the law as well as the 
Reequilibration of the economic 
policies of the two countries would 
be relatively easy of accomplish- 
ment. 

Pursuing the policy of a comple- 
mentary economy between the 
United States, a temperate coun- 
try, and the Philippines, a tropical 
country, we could retrench in some 
of the traiff-protected industries 
which are considered competitive 
in the United States, and this is 
the time to decide on it because 
of the destruction that those in- 
dustries have suffered and the ex- 
tent that they will be rebuilt. 
However, the retrenchment must 
have compensating considerations 
in fairness to those industries. Be- 
sides. it must be simultaneous w’ith 
the development of new industries 
which either have world-wide mar- 
kets or are not competitive with 
existing American products. I 
have a memorandum on the new 
industries, which I expect to sub- 
mit to you in due course. 

Let me interpolate right here 
that there is no sound logic in the 
statement that during a period of 
years the present tariff-protected 
industries could be placed mathe- 
matically on a non-protected basis 
through technological develop- 
ment. Such statement does not 
take into account that our com- 
petitors everywhere are continu- 
ously engaged in the very same 
task of reducing the costs of pro- 
duction, and w'e must not delude 
ourselves into the belief that we 
shall be more successful than them. 
The reduction of cost production 
will fall chiefly on labor and we 
may as well decide now that even 
the Filipino laborer will not stand 
for it. 

Higher Wages Advocated 
Let me say also that in building 
up the new producer-consumer 
economy one of the sources of aid 
and buying power is the existing 
industries. Today the sugar Indus- 
try pays 70% of its income to la- 
bor and employs more manual la- 
bor than its counterpart in other 
regions supplying sugar to the 
United States. The gold mining in- 
dustriy, by its greater mechaniz- 
ation, uses about 30% of its in- 
come on labor and pays the high- 
est individual wages among all 
industries. Labor groups in the 
Philippines have asked for a vert- 
ical wage increase of more than 
100%. This is a matter of the ut- 
most importance and should be 
examined in the light of the simple 
truism that the goose that lays the 
golden eggs must not be slaughter- 
ed. 

This takes me to the matter of 
the American and foreign capital 
in the Philippines. Before the war 
the total American and foreign 
capital in the Philippines totalled 
$425,000,000, of which $259,000,000, 
or 60%, was American. The invest- 
ments of the foreigners were: 
Chinese 11% of the total, Spanish 
10%, British 9% and Japanese, 
with $32,000,000, 8%. Some of the 
Americans may agree to a free 
trade of 20 years, but as a Fili- 
pino, I am not for the philosopy of 
”after-me-the-deluge" and I look 
to a Philippines that will last in 
strength and contentment. 

We want American capital. Am- 
erican technicians and Americans 
In general. Under independence 
American citizens should have the 
status of de facto Filipino citizens. 
My thought is that Filipinos them- 
selves should go to the financial 
markets of the United States and 
procure capital at resonablc rates 
of interest for business, industry 
and development work. To be able 
to do that, they wil lhave to make 
their country an attractive field 
for investment through the preser- 
vation of peaceful conditions and 
the adoption by the government of 
encouraging, rather than paralyz- 
ing, policies. This will make for 
the stability and security of capi- 
tal and enterprise already in exis- 
tence and to exist and create a 
friendly atmosphere all around and 
make the Filipinos feel that they 
really own their country, which 
they should improve and preserve. 

' .^gruriun Question Disi^ussed 
I come now to the serious econ- 
omic-social problem in the prov- 
i inces near Manila mentioned in 
‘ the directive, dated October 26, 

1 1946, by the President of the 
- United States to the U. S. High 
Commissioner to the Philippines. 
According to the directive, thous- 
ands of farmhands and share-crop- 
|pcrs are demanding more compen- 
• sation from the landowners, who 
jare either unable or unwilling to 
satisfy them. This question is very 
relevant to the plan of a new pro- 
ducer-consumer economy. The Fili- ' 



pino landowners, particularly the I 
rice growers who are the parties ■ 
involved here, are not able to pay 
the farmhands and share-croppers 
more because their farm income j 
does not justify it. Both sides are 
not to blame. The chief respons- 
ibility for the situation is our un- 
balanced development between the 
literary and cultural on the one 
side and the economic and scien- 
tific on the other. 

For instance, the yield of our 
rice per acre hasn’t increased much 
in the last 25 years and that 
simple fact is the reason why the 
landow'ners can’t pay their work- 
ers more. I think Mrs. Manuel 
Quezon, the widow of our late 
President, has one of the real solu- 
tions. She invited foreign rice ex- 
perts to her farm and succeeded 
in finding out the best seed variety 
for the soil. As a result the yield 
per acre increased as much as 
150% and she w’as better able to 
meet the demands of her workers 
for higher share, and she provided 
for them schools, movies, better 
housing and other things. This is 
the right solution, but it takes 
times to produce results. In the 
meantime the situation now pre- 
vailing might be relieved immedi- 
ately by financial advances to the 
Filipino farm workers and share- 
croppers generally after the fash- 
ion of what was done in Puerto 
Rico by the Federal Government. 
There is hardly any need for an 
investigation of the situation. 
Everybody knows it. The remedy 
should be applied now. 

I wish to emphasize one basic | 
idea at this juncture. The estab-j 
lishment of a new economy in the 
Philippines must take into consid- 
eration the correlation of our edu- 
cational system so that our prog- 
gresss in culture and education 
shall not outrun our economic 
ability to pay and support such 
progress. 

Resume of Points 

Recapitulating the points I tried 
to bring up in this paper, we must 
have a new producer-economy to 
be the chief prop to our ecnomic 
structure; that the prefential trade 
relations between the United 
States and the Philippines should 
go on to co-exist with tl\e special 
military position of the United 
States in the Philippines; that a 
retrenchment in the tariff-protect- 
ed products should be adopted only 
after due compensation and simul- 
taneous ^vith the development of 
new industries; that the United 
States should give the Philippines 
the necessary powers to build up a 
strong domestic economy; that a 
running start of about ten years 
be given the Philippines further to 
fortify that economy; and that 
everything be done, as the pend- 
ing bill attempts to do, to lead the 
Filipinos to take a more impor- 
tant part in the economic avtiv- 
ities of their country. Give the 
Filipinos the chance to progress 
and to live better! 

Wherefore, I respectfully sub- 
mit that Title II of the bill (S. 
1488) under consideration, con- 
cerning Trade Relations, be stric- 
ken out in its entirey and new 
provisions be substituted therefor 
that would carry into effect the 
philosophy set forth in this man- 
ner.

other things that necessitate a 
thorough purge and cleaning up.

Sends Directives 



tance be extended to the Common- 
wealth Government so that law 
and order may be fully restored 
in the shortest possible time, and 
tliat you submit a report to me as 
soon as a program has been form- 
ulated. 

MEMORANDUM to the Secretary 
of the Trea.sury and the Secretary 
of War: 

It is my understanding that due 
to a shortage of legal currency in 
certain areas in the Philippine 
Islands early in the war and con- 
tinually thereafter until the re- 
occupation of the islands by our 
forces, a considerable quantity of 
emergency currency was issued, 
some by properly authorized offi- 
cers of the United States Govern- 
ment and some by representatives 
of the Philippine government. It 
would appear that to the extent 
that this currency was used either 
directly or indirectly for the pros- 
ecution of the war, its redemption 
is a responsibility of the United 
States Government. 

I request that the War euid 
Treasury Departments make a 
careful analysis of this situation 
and submit recommendations as to 
the necessary steps which should 
be taken to discharge the obliga- 
tions that are properly responsibil- 
ities of the United States Govern- 
ment. Any arrangement proposed 
for the redemption of this currency 
should include provisions designed 
so far as possible to avoid any 
windfall to specuators. 

To the Secretary of the Treasury: 

During the period of their mili- 
tary invasion of the Philippine 
Islands, the Japanese issued an un- 
backed fiat peso and tried unsuc- 
cessfully to force its parity with 



the legitimate Philippine peso. The 
issue was so unlimited that it 
came to be worthless, and upon 
our landing in Leyte it was offi- 
cially and quite properly declared 
not to be legal tender. However, 
during the invasion period it had 
a rapidly declining value as a 
medium for local trade, and num- 
erous contracts which involved the 
enemy currency were settled or 
entered into. While it would be 
against the public interest to vali- 
date completely these contracts 
and settlements, a measure us 
needed to serve as a standard for 
judgmients between debtors ^nd 
creditors. 

Since you have representation in 
the Philippines through a mission 
of the Foreign Funds Division, I 
rgfluest that you cooperate with 
the High Commissioner and the 
Commonwealth Government in 
drawing up a schedule showing the 
relative trend of the purchasing 
power and exchange rates of the 
Japanese Philippine peso during 
the period of invasion. 

To the Surplus Property 
Adminl.strator: 

Prolonged enemy occupation and 
active warfare in the Philippine 
Islands have left in their wake a 
tremendous problem of relief and 
rehabilitation. It seems apparent 
that there must be large supplies 
of surplus government property 
now available which could be used 
to great advantage in the Philip- 
pines in the program which must 
be undertaken there by the Philip- 
pine Government. Such items as 
construction equipment, medical 
supplies and hospital equipment 
are badly needed. 

Where such supplies can be used 



directly by the government of the 
Philippine Commonwealth, I be- 
lieve this Government should make 
the supplies available without cost 
to the Commonwealth. It might 
perhaps be desirable to arrange 
the transfer on such terms as 
would prevent the property from 
being later offered for sale to the 
general public. 

Since there is at present no legal 
authority to effect such transfer, I 
believe we should seek such auth- 
ority. 

To the Administrator of 
Veterans’ Affairs: 

In connection with a general 
program of reestablishment of ord- 
erly government in the Philippine 
Islands and the discharge of just 
obligations of the United States 
Government therein, I request that 
the Veterans’ Administration make 
a careful analysis of all phases of 
past and current benefits payable 
in the Philippine Islands to Am- 
erican and Filipino veterans, and 
submit to me at the eaurliest pos- 
sible date a report which should 
be accompanied by recommenda- 
tions for any new legislation which 
may be required. 

To the President of the Export- 
Import Bank: 

In connection with the rehabili- 
tation of the Philippine Islands 
and the restoration of the normal 
economic life of the Islands. I be- 
lieve that the 'Export-Import Bank 
should participate ii^ this program. 
It should, it seems to me, be possi- 
ble to work out a program to op? 
crate in the Islands on a purely 
business basis which would be of 
great assistance in restoring nor- 
mal economic conditions. 

May I have your comment on 



this suggestion, and in the event 
that you feel that the bank is at 
present without legal authority to 
function in the Philippines, yo© 
suggestions as to step>s that might 
be necessary to permit it to do so? 

To the Administrator of the Wir 
Shipping Administration: 

In connection with the rehabifi. 
tation of the Philippines and the 
restoration of normal economic life 
of the Islands, I am very anxiot^ 
that all possible steps, consistei? 
with our obligations elsewhere, be 
taken tq supply adequate shipping 
to the Philippine Islands. 

I would be glad to have a state- 
ment from you as to the plans of 
the War Shipping AdministratioB 
and the amount of tonnage which 
is exi>ected to be available for 
Philippine trade, particularly in 
the near future. 

To the Chairman of the Recon- 
struction Finance Corporation: 

'The almost complete lack 
consumers goods in the Philippioei 
— goods ordinarly imported from 
the United States — has brought 
about serious price inflation and 
black markets which cause great 
distress among the people. An ex- 
cellent start has been made by the 
Foreign Economic .Administration 
in cooperation with the War Ship- 
ping Administration to eliminate 
inflation by facilitating normal 
import trade. 

You are, therefore, requested to 
direct the United States Commer- 
cial Company to use resources and 
personnel within its jurisdiction to 
continue and to advance the Philip- 
pine program which it has under- 
taken, and, where necessary, to 
sell goods on credit terms not ex- 
ceeding two years in duratiorL

Representatives of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation assigned 
to the Philippines should be direc- 
ted to report through the United 
States High Commissioner in con- 
nection with this and other opera- 
tions in the Philippine Islands. 

To the Secretary of War: 

As a result of prolonged enemy 
occupation of the Philippines the 
law enforcement agencies of the 
Ck)mmon wealth Government were 
seriously disorganized. Bearing in 
mind the fact that the War De- 
partment was responsible original- 
ly for the organization of the 
Philippine Constabulary, which had 
such an excellent record prior to 
the war, I believe that the War 
Department should assist in every 
possible way by the assignment of 
officers and men and the transfer 
of necessary equipment in reorgan- 
izing the Constabulary on a non- 
military basis. 

President Osmena has advised 
me that the War Department has 
already been of assistance in this 
task and that considerable prog- 
ress has been made by the Com- 
monwealth Government. Both he 
and I feel, however, that continu-

ation is completed would be help-

THE SUPERIOR RACE 

Bv Raymundo Costosa 



Under the two joint resolutions adopted by the Congress 
of the United States, approved by President Franklin U. Roose- 
velt, complete independence for the Philippines, now set for 
July 4, 1946, would be advanced if the Commonwealth is liber- 
ated from the Japs before that time. 



In approving the above resolutions, President Roosevelt 

said: "It i!s declared to be the^ — " ’ " ' — 



1,‘S 






policy of the Congress that the 
United States shall drive the trea- 
cherous, invading Japanese from 
the Philippine Islands, restore as 
quickly as possible the orderly, 

free democratic processes of gov- 
ernment to the Filipino people, and 
thereupon establish the complete 
independence of the Philippine Is- 
lands as a separate nation." 

And when the Philippines are 
fully established as an independ- 
ent nation, the members of the 
so-called "superior race," who have 
lived in splendor on those beauti- 
ful islands prior to the Japanese 
perfidy, are doomed to bitter dis- 
appointment. They will discover 
that the prerogatives which for 
centuries they had enjoyed, be- 
cause of the white man’s suprem- 
acy, are just memories of the 
golden age of exploitation. 

We Filipinos will be free to 
shape our own affairs and free to 
pass such laws as we may deem 
necessary. But, while we possess 
this freedom of action, it does not 
mean that we will be unjust, ab- 
usive or arrogant in our conduct 
toward others. We are a kindly 
people by nature. Because of it, 
foreign residents, who do not go 
about demonstrating their racial 
superiority, are assured of fair 
treatment. But those who cling to 
the Idea that the Filipinos are 
second-class human beings will un- 
doubtedly find life uneasy and un- 
comfortable. To this class of peo- 
ple, we Filipinos will say: There 
is no place for you in the Philip- 
pines . . . Keep away from our 
shores . . . 

Those foreign elements, espe- 
cially the Spaniards, who wish to 
remain on our soil, will find it 
necessary to adjust themselves ac- 
cordingly. The old attitude of 
treating native Filipinos with con- 
tempt will no longer be ignored. 
They must face the fact that the 
Philippines will be governed by 
Filipinos. Briefly, they will have 
to learn to deal with us on an 
equal footing, for their notion of 



race superiority is silly and shat- 
tered beyond repair . . . 

Our country Is a good market 
for foreign products. But our 
trade will no longer be under the 
monopoly of foreign groups. In- 
dustrialists and merchants, who 
think of doing business again in 
postwar Philippines, will have to 
do it in close collaboration with 
Filipinos, cither as associates or 
partners. The mere employment 
of Pinoys in some minor capaci- 
ties, in order to gain or attract 
native patronage, is not enough. 
We insist on having a proper share 
in the profits which may be de- 
rived through Philippine trade. 

Foreigners who are not imbued 
with fantastic ideas about the 
superiority of their white skin and 
high noses will get along very 
nicely in the Philippines. Life 
there, except for the climate which 
becomes very warm at times, is 
not so strenuous as in other parts 
of the world. Of course, it is not 
altogether a bed of roses. But one 
does not have to work very hard 
to get the bare necessities of life. 
In Spain, people live practically 
on patatas and garvanzos. Food 
is abundant in the Philippines. 
And, what is more, the Filipinos 
are not only friendly to foreigners 
but also helpful. 

Of the foreigners who live In the 
Philippines, the Spaniards are 
about the most arrogant and dom- 
ineering. They exalt in the thought 
that they belong to a master race. 
How they love to display whatever 
authority they possess . . . The 
Spaniards call the natives "indios," 
meaning Indians. And the Fili- 
pinos, who work in Spanish house- 
holds or farms, are called "mucha- 
chos,” meaning servants. 'The fact 
that the Filipinos have their own 
names does not make any differ- 
ence because, after all, they are 
not called by their names. They 
are simply known as "muchachos." 

Such ridiculous conduct is not 
confined to the .Spanish laymen. 
The Spemish priests behave in the 
same manner. Sometimes they are

worse, notwithstanding the teach- 
ings of their church. 

As a boy, I had occasion to see 
how a Spanish priest exercised his 
assumed authority. This took 
place in the town of Lambunao, 
Iloilo, Philippines. 

One Sunday morning, El Capi- 
tan (Mayor of the town) did not 
attend church services. Instead 
he went to his farm, which was 
located a few miles away. The 
priest, Padre Nicolas Purras, no- 
ticed his absence. So, after the 
mass, the Padre sent for El Capi- 
tan. It waas four in the ciftemoon 
when this dignitary, carrying a 
decorated walking - cane, which 
serves as a symbol of his office, 
arrived in the convent. At that 
time, the Padre and several of his 
friends, including my father, were 
playing burro, a card game which 
is similar to poker. As El Capi- 
tan was ushered into the room, the 
Padre arose from his seat to meet 
him. And, when the two were 
within arms reach, the Padre 
asked El Capitan why he did not 
go to church, El Capitan ex- 
plained that he could not because 
his presence was needed on the 
farm. Without uttering another 
word, the Padre slapped El (Kapi- 
ton on the face. Of course, the 
poor official could not fight back. 
He had to take the punishment. 
Otherwise, he would have been 
accused of being a rebel, and the 
penalty would have been imprison- 
ment or death. 

To this day, the Spaniards in the 
Philippines are contemptuous of 
the Filipinos. Somehow they can- 
not seem to reconcile the fact that 
the Pinoys are human beings. This 
is also true even when they change 
their political status. For in- 
stance, take the Spaniards whom 
Quezon appointed to high posts in 
the Philippine GJovemment. These 
men are just as snobbish and ego- 
tistical as their ancestors. They 
simply cannot bear to mingle with 
native Filipinos whom they call 
chongos. Yet, were it not for us, 
they would be paupers today, still 
eating nothing but patatas and 
garvanzos in Spain. Such in- 
grates! . . . and hypocrites! . . . 

But with the advent of a Philip- 
pine Republic, conditions will be 
different. However, we Filipinos 
need not expect a complete change 
unless these Spaniards are re- 
moved from positions of power or 
influence. Need we tolerate them ? 
Let us keep up our fight for race 
equality!* Down with those who 
discriminate against us as a peo- 
ple! Down with any so-called 
superior race"!

Filipinos Quit 
In Santa Maria 



About 150 Filipino lettuce work- 
ers in Santa Maria quit because of 
difference of opinion on the mean- 
ing of an order of the Federal gov- 
ernment on wage ceiling. Juan F. 
Baysa, Alex Castro and Andres 
Aguinaldo took charge of the Fili- 
pino side of the controversy. 

It was believed that an under- 
standing would be reached and the 
work resumed.

In Westmoreland 



Some Filipino farmers in Im-

ity of the farmers are in the Val- 
ley.

admit, is that in this time of the

situation by appointing to his Cabinet a Secretary of the 
Interior. This official, according to Philippine administra- 
tive law, will succeed the President if both he and the Vice- 
President became unable or incapacitated to serve. 

President Osmena has the E^t wishes and firm loyalty 
of his countrymen as he takes the executive direction of the 
government. Somehow he inspires in them a Filipinism 
that touches both their minds and hearts and makes them 
proud of themselves as Filipinos and ready to work with 
him in the redemption of their common country from the 
enemy and its rebuilding and regeneration after the war. 
Every Filipino worthy of his salt desires him to know that 
he is at his beck and call at any and all times. 

The new President has difficult duties to perform. The 
war and its tremendous requirements has the first call. He 
himself has said that his first concern is to help achieve 
viaory. An administration after his own conception will 
have to be inaugurated. Methods, processes and policies 
wil have to be introduced according to his ideas of propriety, 
efficiency and effectiveness in a regime of democracy and 
freedom. President Osmena is a positive personality with 
positive ideas and positive objectives. He has the power 
and powerful he will be. 

The shortage of qualified personnel is a problem to 
the government. It is rationally to be expected that Presi- 
dent Osmena will canvass the whole field of available Fili- 
pinos and pick out those that could help him efficaciously 
in his work. Politics in its ordinary signification is ad- 
journed. New men with no ambition higher than the wel- 
fare of the Philippines are the men that he would consider 
as his collaborators. We are morally certain that to Presi- 
dent Osmena the standard for the flection of men is the 
possession of patriotism, ability, loyalty, common sense, en- 
thusiasm and invincible determination to serve the best in- 
terests of the Philippines. 

President Osmena is a tried and true statesman. He 
is not a novitiate in national leadership. He has the quali- 
ties of calm in the presence of danger or difficulty, courage 
that does not go over radonal limits, mental penetration 
that sees right and wrong, a sense of justice that he asserts 
bravely and even-ha ndedly, and a humaneness that he radi- 
ates naturally and with such ineffable charm. He is reli- 
giously devout, a model family man, a progressive conserva- 
tive, a discriminating liberal, a gentleman in its noblest 
sense, a studious scholar and a profound thinker and, above 
all a good man who likes other good men and is respeaed 
by them. 

A new era, the era of good feeling, mutual respect 
and honest collaboration, dawns for the Filipinos as Presi- 
dent Osmena takes the helm of the Philippine ship of state. 
It is like him, especially in recent years, to be big and gener- 
ous and under his administration there will be no vendettas, 
reprisals, divisions, injustices and discriminations. Those 
who could coopertite sincerely would be welcome, we are 
sure, if they could do so loyally and in accordance with his 
code of principles and discipline. All shades of opinion, 
all ranks of society, all departments of human aaivities we 
hope will be represented in his government, which is in 
effect a coalition government. 

The MAIL, with all its shortcomings and imperfec- 
tions, has always stood by and for Mr. Osmena, believing 
in his rectitude, stability, ability and sincerity. When nearly 
all others have displayed other loyalties and preferences. 
The MAIL was for him and expressed itself with emphasis 
and without equivocation for Sergio Osmena, the man and 
the public official; and all it wants now is to wish him great 
success in his administration as President of the Philippines.

and that therefore American farm- 
ers will soon return to the land. 

It is also contended that Ameri- 
can agriculture can not depend 
permanently on Mexican nationals 
and it is desired to see Filipino 
continue as farm workers and not 
as growers.

dignity, its rights and its welfare. 



The MAIL’S Ideas 
Are Realized 

Wc advocated that the Nationals 
Division bo taken out of the Resi- 
dent Commissioner’s Office. That 
was done by President Quezon less 
than two months ago. We advocat- 
ed that David Bernstein be replac- 
ed by Col. Carlos P. Romulo. That 
was done. 

We suggested the resignation of 
Joaquin M. Elizalde as Resident 
Commissioner for many reasons. 
Now he has resigned and Col. 
Romulo has taken his place. 

We pointed out the inconsistent 
position of Secretary of Finance 
Andres Soriano and the embar- 
rassment that his presence in the 
Philippine government causes it. 
Now he has left the government 
and Auditor General Hernandez 
has been appointed in his place. 

We fought unceasingly the racia- 
lism and discriminations that Com- 
missioner Elizalde started. Now 
that ugly regime has been ended. 

We battled against the anti-de- 
mocratic and Fasclstlc practices in 
the Philippine government and the 
favoritisms and prejudices that ex- 
isted there. Now they are discard- 
ed, discredited and destroyed. 

The foregoing is not a complete 
recital of the success of our cru- 
sades, for others are still to be 
realized. They succeeded because 
the things we fought w'ere wrong. 
When we started the fight it was 
like shouting in the wilderness. We 
were in the position of a David 
thundering at the gate of mighty 
Goliath. But we were determined. 

Now our efforts have been 
crowned with success; and we arc 
not getting puffed up about it. 



Wo WIU Fight 
Fascist Roprisals 
We have been informed that the 
Soriano-Elizalde combine and its 
followers who have left the Philip- 
pine government are going to make 
it difficult for that government 
and punish 'The MAIL for its vig- 
orous campaign that brought their 
Fascism and Falangism before the 
American government, press and 
public. 

’The MAIL is ready for any re- 
prisals. It will fight the Fascists 
with all its force. We are condi- 
tioning our plans against the plans 
of the Fascists and Falangists. 

We know that the Philippine 
government can take care of it- 
self, but we will support and de- 
fend it if any Fascist attacks de- 
velop. We are determined to up- 
hold our government against all its 
enemies.

SOCIAL DOINGS 
Here and There 



By PPA Society Editor 
SAN FRANCISCO (FPA) — 
Nov. 17, 1945 — The Marine Inspec- 
tion at Fort Mason honored two of 
its most distinguished members, 
Capt. S. J. Merrill and Capt. Man- 
uel L. Fuentes, at a despedida din- 
ner in their honor at the Baguio 
Cafe, on Saturday night, Nov. 17. 
1945. Captain Merrill is going to 
the Philippines and Capt. Fuentes 
will command an overseas craft 
after his training at New Orleans, 
Louisiana. Before dinner was serv- 
ed, appreciative talks were* given 
by Capt. Fuentes who acted as 
master of ceremonies, Capt. Mer- 
rill, Mrs. Sulit and Mr. Roldan. 
The Filipino string orchestra of 
the transport MAUI enlivened the 
occasion, which was graced by the 
presence of the very charming and 
famous wife of Capt. Fuentes, 
whose nome de plume is CHaire 
Phillips; and by Miss Susana Mor- 
eno, the cousin of General Manuel 
Roxas, President of the Philippine 
Senate. Among those present were: 
Mrs. Estela R. Sulit, Mr. Vicente 
Roldan, Mr. Amadeo Rodriguez, 
Lt. K. E. Gadau, Mr. Arturo Laz- 
arte, Mr. and Mrs. Del San Jose, 
Mr. Primo C. Bocar, Mr. Pedro 
Kopico, Mr. Mariano Pasay, Mr. and 
Mrs. Allegado and daughter, Mr. 
and Mrs. Taijeron, Mr. and Mrs. 
Joe Vargas, Mr. S. N. Abalos, Mr. 
and Mrs. F. D. Marte, Miss Elva 
Brooks, Mr. Julian Gutierrez, Mr. 
Florencio Mauing, Mr. D. Ibanez, 
Mr. Leopoldo Gomez Llanos, Mr. 

Pedro Ruiz, Mr. and Mrs. Pedro S. 

• 

J. Bernardino, Mr. Vicente Pereira, 
Mr. Simon Palmon, Mr. Jesus Fer- 
nandez, Mr. Roberto Ocapom, Mr. 
Conrado Bernardo, Mr. Felix San 
Jose, Mr. S. Padilla, Mr. and Mrs. 
Romualdo Kimpo, and several 
other friends of the Maritime In- 
spection Division. 

The affair served as a testimon- 
ial of good will and appreciation 
to Capt. MerrDl who has been a 
real friend of the Filipinos both in 
and out of the Marine Inspection 
Division, and also to Capt. Fuen- 
tes whose rise in the ladder of suc- 
cess has been a source of pride to 
his conutrymen. Lt. Gadau takes 
over the duties of Capt. Merrill, 
and his youth and good looks and 
cheerful disposition are assets to 
an assured success in his job. 

Once more the culinary ability 
of Mrs. Edeng Kimpo asserted it- 
self when the delicious lumpia and 
tapa were served to the delight of 
the guests. 



FRIENDS. RELATIVES ENTERTAINED 
DARING GUERRILLA LEADER 




Port Of Missing 
Persons 



When Lt. Col. Rizalino F. 

* — 

Llamas arrived in San Francisco 
the first week of this month en 
route to Camp Lee in Virginia for 
refresher courses, his relatives and 
friends failed to recognize him. 



J J 

The daring, young officer who* 



headed the guerrillas and a Pan- 
gasinan regiment was three times 
captured and three times he 
escaped. But the tortures inflicted 
by the Japanese left a cruel mark 
on his face. 

Lt. Col. Llamas was the first 
Filipino to greet the Americans 
when they landed in Lingayen 
during the liberation of the Philip- 
pines. It was from Lingayen, his 
home town, that the young officer 
retreated to Bataan with his men. 

His first escape was from the 
March of Death. He was twice 
captured as a guerrilla leader in 
Pangasinan. 

The prominence of Col. Llamas’ 
family made it difficult for him to 
conduct his guerrilla campaign 
outside of Lingayen. He had to be 
continually watched by the Japan- 
ese who saw to it that he was nev- 
er out of their sight. 

Under this difficult circum- 



tod introduced the daring colonel 
to her many friends during a Gar- 
den Forum affair at St. Claire 
Hotel where Mr. and Mrs. Primo 
Villarruz and Rev. and Mrs. Juan 
Callao were also part of a dele- 
gation from the Filipino group. 
Also in San Jose, Col. Llamas was 
the guest of Publisher Delfin F. 
Cruz of The PHILIPPINES MAIL. 

In Stockton, he was the guest 
of President and Mrs. Antonio A. 
Gonzalez and Mr. and Mrs. E. L. 
Garcia. 

Col. Llamas paid a surprise visit 
to his relatives. President and Mrs. 
Evaristo C. Pecson of the Filipino 
Federation of America. 

It was in San Francisco at a 
dinner given by President D. T. 
Duga of the Philippine Chamber 
of Commerce of America that Col. 
Llamas learned from Governor 
Confesor that he was the first 
choice to be governor of Pangas- 
inan. The ruling of General Mac- 
Arthur, however, blocked his ap- 
pointment. 



FILIZARDO BORROMEO, be- 
lieved to be living in San Fran- 
cisco, California, whose where^ 
abouts are wanted by his brother 
C^pt. Emilio Borromeo, 0-1801 of 
the Philippine Army, now taking 
a Refresher Course at Fort Leav- 
enworth, Kansas. If any one who 
happens to know the present 
whereabouts of this man, kindly 
communicate with the editor of 
this paper or directly to Capt. 
Borromeo, 316 Apartment 7 Dori- 
phon, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. 



stances. Coll. Llamas rnanaged to, . BALTIMORE, Maryland (PFA) 
contact his men whom he scatter-- 



ed throughout the province, by a 
secret rendezvous in a mongo con 
hielo parlor. His men would con- 
tact Col. Llamas through his wife 
who was thed managing the re- 
freshment parlor. At night, his 
wife would report to him at home. 

When the time came for the 
Americans to strike in Lingayen, 
Col. Llamas gathered his men and 
helped chase Yamashita until he 
ordered them to fight. Four bat- 
talions from Col. Lamas’ regiment 
[was pocketed in Baguio and later 
surrendered. 

Before leaving for Virginia, the 
young officer was entertained by 
many friends and relatives in Cali- 
fornia. 

In San Jose, Col, Llamas was 
the guest of Miss Pacita Todtod at 
her beautiful home. Hostess Tod- 



to leave for Manila towards the 
end of the month to establish busi- 
ness connections in the Philippines. 



Inquiry is being made by Miss 
Sofia Yehen Mendiola from Don 
Pedro Street, Tanawan, Leyte. 
Philippines, as to the whereabouts 
of her uncle Gerardo O. Mendiola 
who left the Philippines in 1909 in 
his early twenties. Lasf word from 
him was in 1919, wheli he was 
then residing on the Pacific Coast. 
Letters of inquiry were received 
by Capt. M. S. Sulit, and anyone 
having information about Mr. Ger- 
ardo O. Mendiola, please commun- 
icate with this paper or with C^pt. 
Sulit at 766 Fell Street, San

CUMSI - CUMSA 



By MARIA MABILOG 
(Waahlng^ton, D. C.) 
President Osmena is getting 
worried at the increasing number 
of "members" In the family of 
Mrs. Aurora Quezon who are go> 
ing to Manila in the plane with 
him. Already there are five ladies 
whose surnames are not "Quezon." 



Miss Jesusa Bautista, sister-in- 
law of Col. Tomas Cabili, has al- 
ready touched tjie romantic sides 
of at least two Filipino officials. 
But one particularly, a doctor in 
economics, is ready to abandon his 
bachelorhood if and when . . . Miss 
Bautista is not only pretty but is 
also the mirror of kindness, 
thoughtfulness and good sense. 



The fiance of Miss Virginia 
Hidalgo is waiting for her in Man- 
ila. He is a Lieutenant in the U.S. 
Army who was with the Filipino 
Regiment which trained at San 
Luis Obispo in California. Virgin- 
ia's return to Manila is predicted 
for an early date. 



Commonwealth Anniversary Feted 
Here; Gov. Conf esor Guest of Honor 

ARROYO GRANDE (FPA) — The biggest civic and social 
event in the Filipino colony hete occurred when the tenth anniv- 
ersary of the founding of the Commonwealth of the Philippines 
was celebrated jointly with the liberation of the Philippines, an 
event Filipinos and Americans looked forward to since the Fili- 
pino Community of San Luis Obispo county announced its 

preparations late last month. 

Highlighting the celebration was^-- ■ - - . ■ — 



Capt. Manuel Abella is now stay- 
ing in one of the dormitories of 
a local University, but he meiin- 
tains his news funnels with the 
Commonwealth ofnee and he has 
got his eyes on what's going on in 
Cong^ress. 



"Will Mrs. Vicente Lim accept 
a new position from President Os- 
mena and be in politics?” 'That's 
the question that Filipino officials 
ask each other. Being the head of 
the women’s federation. President 
Osmena and Resident Commission- 
er Carlos Romulo believe she can 
be of great aid to Mr. Osmena’s 
campaign for re-election. 



*nie taltented Miss Drago helps 
Resident Commissioner Carlos P. 
Romulo in his writings. 



Miss Gladys Beauchamps has 
changed since she returned from 
San Francisco. She is now some- 
what uppish and smarty-ish. 



President Osmena is a regular 
reader of PM newspaper. He has 
been reading articles against him 
in that paper. PM has had some 
good words to say about Gov. 
Tomas Conteaor, 



Everyone in the Commonwealth 
office is conscious of the fact that 
some big political deal is being 
concoted there under the rvame of 
"reorganization." 



It is reported that Gen. Romulo 
wants to be sure that he will con- 
tinue as Commissioner and he as- 
pires to be Ambassa(\or from next 
July 194a 





Believe it or not, Secretary Jai- 
me Hernandez (who is called in 
his back as "Mr. Zero") is report- 
ed to be under consideration by 
President Osmena as his running- 
mate, that is. Vice-President 



‘Why not Cabili and Confesor" 
or "Confesor and Cabili" for Pre- 
sident and Vice-President?" a dis- 
tinguished Filipino asked. The tic- 
ket may be called the T-N-T. The 
two Ts stand for Tomas or Tom- 
my. Now watch the 'TNT ticket 
emerge at the proper time. 



Filipino officials and employees 
outside of one or two, will be much 
happier if Dave Bernstein, public 
relations officer at 10 grand, re- 
sig^ and leaves the Common- 
wealth premises. 



When Attorney Vicente Vlllamin 
came to the C^ommonwealth library 
to read certain books and re- 
ports for several hours the rumor 
immediately spread that he was 
going to be appointed to a high 
position. Mr. Villamin Is a con- 
hrmed out-of-the-govemment man 
and is “agin' the government." 



Dr. Belen Pardo, dentist and 
critic, is under consideration for 
government "p e n s i o n a d o." No 
doubt that pretty and spirited 
Belen is full of ideas, so much so 
that some think she is a Socialist 
or a Communist. 



the presence of Governor Tomas 
Confesor, guerrilla governor of Pa- 
nay who, with Mr. Antonio A. 
Gonzalez, president of the FICOW 
S, and Mr. Jose Reyes, president 
of the Filipino Community of Los 
Angeles, and a newspaperman. 

Big Banquet 

The celebration began with a 
suptuous banquet at a downtown 
hotel in San Luis Obispo where 
the famed governor was guest of 
honor and graced by the company 
and presence of prominent citizens 
of the city and county. 

Repeating his plea for help In 
the rehabilitation of the Philii>* 
pines, Governor Confesor said that 
a one-billion dollar loafi from the 
United States would not only help 
in putting back the country on her 
feet again but also give America 
enough volume in business, because 
the former would be making pur- 
chases for tools and goods very 
badly needed in restoring com- 
merce and industry. 

Good Response 

A very good response came from 
the American audience when Mr. 
Fred Feriini, chairman of the 
board of supervisors of the city of 
San Luis Obispo; District Attorney 
Herbert C. Grundell, and Sheriff 
Murray C. Hathaway expressed 
sympathy with the cause of Philip- 
pine rehabilitation and ccmimented 
on the great part played by Fili- 
pinos in cooperation with civic 
activities of the area. 

. Dr. Howard B. Kirkland, chair- 
man of the San Luis Obispo war 
finance committee, stated that 
Filipinos in the county had always 
gone over their quota in all the 
drives conducted during the war. 
Topping his own report was the 
fact that they had always been 
one of the first to fill their quota 
while other minority groups were 
still woricing hard on their own. 

Loyalty of FiUplnoo 

Elaborating on his statement on 
the loyalty of F'ilipinos to America 
as demonstrated in the Philippines, 
Governor Confesor said: "Bataan 
was not a result of a moment's 
reaction. The guerrilla movement 
had its roots in the years when 
American teachers went there not 
to use their guns but to teach 
principles of American democracy. 
. . . The history of the Philippines 
is a milestone in the history of the 
Far East." 

Governor Confesor traced the 
threads of Philippinc-American 
friendship, and said that because 
of the square dealing and integrity 
of America, the Philippines be- 
came the first line of defense for 
this country in the war. For this 
reason, he declared that Filipinos 
or the Philippines should have first 
priority In regards to loans for 
rehabilitation. 

Huge Barbecue 

The celebration was topped off 
with a huge barbecue in Arroyo 
Grande the following day to which 

ing to occupy a position higher 
than what he is holding now, but 
what it is, nobody knows at pres- 
ent 



the public was invited. American 
friends of the community were 
present to partake of the sumptu- 
ous lunch laid out on big tables. 
In the evening a program and 
dance was held at the high school 
auditorium, also attended by more 
than two thousand Americans and 
Filipinos. At this program (Gover- 
nor Confesor was once more the 
guest speaker, and he outlined his 
plan for rehabilitation of the 
Philippines. 

At the banquet in San Luis Ob- 
ispo, Mr. Ted Fermin, president of 
the Filipino community delivered 
welcome remarks; followed by Mr. 
Salvador Reyes, who also remark- 
ed on the occasion in behalf of the 
Filipino Growers Association of 
San Luis Obispo County. 

Guests Introduced 

Chairman of the evening was 
Mr. Antonio A. Ckmzalez, who in- 
troduced Governor Confesor to the 
audience. He also introduced prom- 
inent personalities of the city and 
county of San Luis Obispo. 

Presented were Mr. Roque dc la 
Ysla, Sheriff Murray C Hathaway, 
District Attorney' H. C. Grundell, 
and Mrs. Grundell, Q)l. and Mrs. 
de Graff, Major Henry Clay Con- 
ner, Jr., Mr. and Mrs. FYed Fer-

Mr. and Mrs. De Leon, Miss Stella

Osmena In 

Washington 

President Sergio Osmena has 
good friends and advisers in Wall 
Street. Amang the are Joseph 
Rovensky of the Chase National 

Bank and Douglas Lynch of the 
Westinghouse Electric Corpor- 
ation. 



When Osmena wants some econ- 
omic information he asks Commis- 
sioner Romulo, who asks Dr. Urb- 
an© Zafra, who asks Dr. Amando 
Dalisay. When the infromation 
reaches Osmena it is so distorted 
that even Dr. Dalisay finds it hard 
to recognize. 



Amcrian representatives of Am- 
erican business in the Philippines 
want Osmena to ignore the com- 
plaint of the Filipino workers, far- 
mers and share-croppers for high- 
er wages. FTobably that’s why Os- 
mena is so non-chalant about the 
people’s complaint. 



The best informed Filipino on 
Philippine economics is in Wash- 
ington who is giving his views to 
Congress on how to re-arrange the 
Philippine economy so the people's 
poverty could be liquidated and 
yet Osrpena does not confer with 
him. He is Vicente Villamin, who 
is working on his own and is con- 
nected with no business or politic- 
al interests and who is giving his 
time, energy, experience and en- 
thusiasm free to be of service to 
the Filipino people. 



High American government offi- 
cials are slow to discuss long-term 
plans with Osmena because they 
consider that he will be wiped out 
from power by Gen. Manuel Roxas 
and it's better to wait until a new 
President is elected by the Fili- 
pinos. 



Everytime Osmena gets in touch 
with Senator Millard Tydlngs, the 
Senator makes him feel that his 
suggestions are unnecessary and in 
many cases have already bee car- 
ried out without consultation with 
him. 



Osmena thinks that Gen. Manuel 
Roxas will repent and come to him 
and ask to be permitted to be on 
his ticket as Vice-President. But 
all American government agencies, 
newspapermen, army and navy 
officials report that Roxas will 
beat Osmena hands down — and 
Roxas is not a man with a banana 
backbone or is so blind as not to 
see Osmena’s "juego" (game). 



Persons who talk with Osmena 
are painfully surprised to find out 
that he does not know thoroughly 
the provisions of the bills pending 
in Congress affecting the Philip- 
pines. 



Mrs. Gloria Tuazon, as direc- 
tress of the Philippine Center, is I 
doing very well and everybody 
likes her. Good for Gloria! 



many people who want to see him ^

m u c h and too publicly about ano is described as an "ex-Filipino 
"them business corporations." y nuevo Americano." Some people 

predict that he will end up by be- 
ing an Argentine citizen. 



When former Resident Commis- 
sioner Ellizalde was in Washington 
it was believed by many that he 
made inquiries on how to become 
an American citizen. 



Major Antonio Madrigal, mill- 1 
tary aide to President Osmena, | 
seems to be sleepy all the time. He ■ 
doesn’t seem to be interesed in 
what he is doing. 



American lobbyists who come to 
the Commonwealth office act and 
talk as if they own the Filipino 
officials. They make enemies for 
the groups that they represent. 



President Osmena expresses sur- 
prise at the report that certain 
officials of the Commonwealth! 
have organized themselves into 
private business corporations in 
violation of the Constitution. 



Mrs. Maria Batoon feels that 
she has been left high and dry by 
Dr. Maximo M. Kalaw, who talked 
to her about many cultural and 
artistic things that they were go- 
ing to start. That was before the 
Doctor lost interest In those 
things. 



Don’t be surprised if Col. Tomas 
Cabili becomes the C!hief of Staff 
of the Philippine Army, succedlng; 
Gen. Basilic J. Y&ldes. 



"Admiral" Manuel Adeva is go- 



It is said that Mrs. Eusebio Ore- 
nse will raise h— if she is not tak- 
en on the plane by President Os- 
mena. She will bring up the trips 
of the Madrigal girls. Miss Clem- 
ena and Mrs. Guillermo Rustia. 



Miss Puring Hernandez, daugh- 
ter of Secretary Hernandez, has 
stopped using the official car, say- 
ing that she didn’t know that she 
was violating certain rules in use- 
ing it once in a while, not often. 
Excused. 



Miss Maria Madrigal wants to 
go back to Manila with President 
Osmena, but she was told not to 
mention it to the President for he 
won't like it. 

Miss Juling Nakpil also wants 
to go with the President and her 
friends are liable to raise h-;- also 
if she is left behind. Poor Mr. 
Osmena! 



"Where’s Manuel Roxas and why 
isn’t he here to discuss these 
Philippine bills?" are Questions 
Members of Congress are asking. 
Osmena doesn’t worry, for he has 
with him that "great economist,” 
Gen. Carlos Romulo, who doesn’t 
know what tariff its. 



Osmena has overstayed in Wash- 
ington and worn out his welcome. 
The big joke is that he will make 
the Filipino people believe that 
everything good done by President 
Truman, Secretary Ickes, High 
Commissioner McNutt and the U. 
S. Congress for the Philippines are 
his work. In nomine Deo (In the 
name of God), this is an absolute, 
absolute falsehood! 



Because Osmena wants to hog 
all the credit for what is being 
done in Washington, he doesn’t 
want to receive the cooperation of 
Filipinos like Roxas, Villamin and 
others, and so the Filipino people 
will pay several hunderd million 
dollars fo rthe reclection of Os- 
mena.

THE PHILIPPINES MAIL. SALINAS. CALIFORNIA 



NOVEMBER, 1945 




Filipino Hero Returns to Mainland; 
Entertained at Palace Hotel, S. F. 






Hail! Hail! A returning hero! to the Philippines 

A crowed of around 200 men and | taking his wife along with him. 
women at a banquet and baill in! “It is my sincere hope,” he said, 
the Rose Room of the Palace that was the war for us to 



Hotel, San Francisco, last Satur- 
day, the 24th, cheered M/Sgt. 
Eustaquio Cabais, recently return- 
ed from the South Pacific and the 



fight. But, just in case, some hood- 
lum nation would again start trou- 
ble with our Uncle Same — boy! if 
I were 80 years old, believe me, no 



Philippines, as he was introduced grandpa-me-much-too-old- 



to them by Matias Ayon, master 
of ceremoniefe of the evening. 

The affair was sponsored by the 
SamcU>Leyte Association of San 
Francisco and it was about the 
biggest social event of that group 
since the war. And one of the 
sponsors was Frank M. Bolima, 
big farmer and leader of Mt. Eden. 
He was also one of the speakers. 

Col. Olson, special guest speak- 
er, was the spellbinders. He lauded 
the great contribution of the Fili- 
pinos, soldiers and civilians, in this 
war. He attended with his charm- 
ing wife, Mrs. Olson. Col. Olson 
just arrived that morning from 
Manila. 

Mrs. Luisa Robin was the only 
speaker among the ladies. She and 
Mr. Simeon Robin, her husband, 
are both Samarinos. 

The story of the acclaimed hero 
is interesting. He first served in 
World War I, enlisting in the U.S. 
Army when he was barely 17. 
“Over there” he was gassed and 
wounded. At that time he did not 
yet finish his high school. When 
the war was over and he was dis- 
charged he had the rank of corpor- 
al. He went back to school and 
graduated from the nationally- 
known Lowell High School, San 
Francisco. Then he took up a busi- 
ness course at Heald’s Business 
College. 

Right after Pearl Harbor, Cab- 
ais* blood boiled and craved for a 
crack at the Japs. “No Nip is go- 
ing to stab Uncle Sam in the back 
and get away with it,” he said, and 
went to a recruiting station to 
volunteer in the Army again. “But 
you are much too old for this, 
grandpa,” he was told by the re- 
cruiting officers. 

That was no English to Cabais. 
He went back and back to the 
office until he was considered a 
nuisance. In addition he prevailed 
upon a certain Col. Johnson, an 
old officer of his in the first war, 
to help him get back into the 
Army. Johnson knew Eustaquio’s 
number — knew the kind of a fight- 
er he was. So, after more persist- 
ence on this Filipino’s part, he was 
notified that he was going to be 
accepted. “Good God!” he yelled. 



I’ll be 



for-that-damned-thing 
there fighting again!” 

Col. Olson, Frank Bolima, Mrs. 
Robin and the rest knew he meant 
it, too. 



Prof. Vicente Lava 
Hukbalahap" Chief 
Is Eminent Chemist 



■ I 



MALOLOS, Philippines — The 
hundreds, of thousands of agrarians 
organized into the “Hukbalahap” 
is headed by one of the most em- 
inent Filipino chemists. He is Dr. 
Vicente Lava, a graduate of the 
University of the Philippines and 
a postgraduate in the United 
States. He was in the U. S. Chem- 
ical Warfare Service in the First 
World War. 

Prof. Lava is a tall, lanky man, 
who has an intense interest in the 
welfare of the Filipino farmer and 
worker and who got sick and tired 
of promises made by politicians, 
including nUie now President Qs- 
mena, that they would do something 
for the common man. His organiz- 
ation was a great help to the Am- 
erican Army and fought the JapS 
while Osmena was an exile in 
Washington. Osmena’s words are 
empty and meaningless to them. 

At first Osmena tried to mis- 
represent the movement in the 
United States, according to re- 
ports from Washington. But the 
report of the U. S. Army Intelli- 
gence showed that the “Huks” are 
patriotic, pro-American Filipinos 
whose only desire is to get a 
square deal from the landowners, 
stop the politicians from their ex- 
cesses and extravagance and pro- 
mote the real well-being of the 
Philippines. 

President Truman obviously 
realizes the nature of the Hukbal- 
ahap movement and its members 
are grateful for his sympathetic 
interest. But they have no faith in 
President Osmena and Gen. .Rom- 
ulo.

fresher courses. 



Heartless Government 
Also Ugly Favortism 



Bolima Succeeds In 

Growing Business 



WASHINGTON— The case of a 
Filipino evacuated from the Philip- 
pines is an eye-opener. This man 
came here with his son to register 
him in a college. He got short of 
funds. He couldn't pay his hotel 
bill of $127. He was bewildered. He 
went^ to the Philippine govern- 
ment. There they read to him 
technical rules and laws. He got 
no help encouragement. And yet 
that government helped with loans 
rich Filipino men and women who 
idled themselves instead of work- 
ed here and in New York during 
the war. So the Filipino doctor 
went to the District of Columbia 
Government, which, after getting 
authority from the Federal gov- 
ernment, went to his aid. That’s 
the Philippine government, that 
spends thousands of dallors for 
useless trips and useless work and 
yet is willing to let a Filipino 
starve. The allowance of President 
Osmena for one day and a half 
would have taken care of his press- 
ing needs. 



Frank M. Bolima is one of the 
best known Filipino leaders any- 
“here’s where I’ll feel at home where in California. He is a lead- 



killing those d — Japs!” 

Back in the Army, and in 30 
days he was made master serge- 
ant. He went overseas — fought 
here — and there — result: Purple 
Heart, Presidential Citation, and 
one or two more decorations. 

Sgt. Cabais is still taking special 
treatment at an Army Hospital. 
When he completely recovers he 




ing Filipino gorwer of Mt. Eden 
and is referred to as the Filipino 
strawberry and tomato “king”. 

Successful businessman that he 
is, Mr. Bolima never has any af- 
fections and says, “If I were a 
success I wouldn’t be ‘slaving’ 10- 
12-14 hours a day in hot sun or in 
the sleet and rain on the farm”. 

Mr. Bolima is a native of Samar. 
He has been in this country for 
bver 20 years. He is a brilliant and 
witty conversationalist and posses- 
ses a fine oratorical voice. He’d do 
well in politics in the Islands. He 
was the founder and first presi- 
dent of the Filipino Community of 
San Francisco. He has been in Mt. 
Eden only four years and has 
made quite a success of himself in 
farming. He lives happily with his 
wife and children and has been 
helpful in War Bond and Red 
Cross Drives of the town.

and loyal friends of the Filipinos, not help the rice growers at all. 



MAIL Proposes Ban 
On Personalisms 



The MAIL proposes to Fili- 
pino newspapers that they don’t 
publish such very personal and 
undignified news items like the 
statement of Senator Mariano 
Cuenco that President Osmena 
is now selling for $6 a square 
meter lands which he bought 
while he was Governor of Cebu 
at less than 5 centavos. The 
fact is real estate has gone up 
in value and Mr. Osmena or 
anybody else has the absolute 
right to .sell his holdings of any 
kind at the best price he can 
obtain. Those who don’t want 
to buy need not buy. 



Gonzalez Is Worth Keeping 



At this period of the history of the Filipino Inter-Com- 
munity Organization of the Western States we are once 
more beset with the task of choosing a man who will be en- 
trusted with administration for another term. It is a serious 
task, and we cannot be too lax in picking such a man. 

What the next ten years^ hold for us we do not know, 
but we are certain that in that time we shall have many 
more problems than we think, and it is up to us now to pile 
up strength for those eventualities. More and more we have 
come to realize what power we shall have within the 
FICOWS when they come, and therefore the choice of a 
man who will stand for us, who will symbolize our united 
front, must not involve too much politics or the many out- 
cries from imagined slights. Of the utmost importance now 
is the choice of a man who will not shirk his responsibility, 
who will have the personality, knowledge or background to 
handle our problems, and above all the willingness to sac- 
rifice in spite of all the odds. That man must be the person- 
ification of our conception of courage, culture, perseverance, 
patience, endurance, tactfulness, and many other qualities 
which would be required of a man we can trust with the des- 
tiny of the organization, nay, our own. 

Looking around to the candidates for the presidency of 
the organization, we have no other choice than Antonio A. 
Gonzalez, who must be kept for another term. 

There seems to be no doubt as to Antonio A. Gonzalez’s 
ability for the office insofar as we are concerned. Even his 
severest critics concede that he is the most able among the 
candidates for the office. Undoubtedly a man of culture and 
with the required personality and manner in meeting both 
Filipinos and Americans, we Hold that we cannot lose in giv- 
ing him the presidency once more. He has had years of ex- 
perience in executive positions of various types, and knows 
the laborer’s side as well as that of the employers. 

We want Gonzalez, not only because of the foregoing, 
but because of his achievements of the past few years. One 
of his toughest jobs has been that of fighting discrimination 
among all kinds of people against Filipinos, particularly in 
hotels, restaurants, and places of employment. He is active 
in inter-racial aaivities both in his own city and and also 
throughout the state. And for the cause of inter-racial unity 
he has spoken before many groups. 

We found it was necessary to convince our leaders from 
the Philippines that we who reside in this country must 
have American citizenship in order to raise us to the level of 
other nationalities, notably the Chinese. It was Antonio A. 
Gonzalez who helped convince them of our need. Mrs. Lim, 
General Romulo, and President Osmena subsequently in- 
dorsed it. He had also been instrumental in getting Assem- 
blyman Vincent Thomas to pledge his efforts to support any 
legislation that will do away with all '*ani-Filipino” laws. 

Because of the efforts of Gonzalez, the Filipino on the 
Pacific Coast has come closer to his government representa- 
tives, who have made sincere Efforts to understand the aver- 
age Filipino and his problems. 

Gonzalez did more to build up the high morale of the 
Filipino Infantry by bringing entertainers who put on high- 
ly moral-building programs which were long remembered 
and discussed. A problem concerning the obtaining of allot- 
ments of the families of our Filipino service men arose to 
smooth out this difficulty quickly. Before the boys left for 
duty in the Pacific, a bus was chartered and spending money 
was given to all service men who availed themselves of this 
opportunity to go to New Mexico to be married. 

There was the problem of the custody of the property of 
some service men. Plans were readily formulated and put 
into aaion so that service men could leave for combat duty 
with their minds at ease and their families settled. 

Because his time is his awn, he has been able to visit 
member communities frequently. In many cases he has set- 
tled local problems whether among idiviuals or members. 

We can also point with pride that for the first time in 
the history of Filipinos in California, the governor of the 
state was present at a Filipino gathering when he was a 
guest at the FICOWS banqa^ held last June. For the first 
time also the Filipinos were able to4iave the president of 
the Philippines jjs their guest when the Honorable Sergio 
Osmena accepted Gonzalez’ invitation to a reception and tea 
held at the San Francisco Palace of the Legion of Honor this 
month. Both of these during the administration of Gonzalez. 

Besides all these qualifications, and there are many 
more, we want Gonzalez again because he fights for the 
FICOWS against those who have been wanting to destroy it 
with a sincerity that is indeed admirable, and because he 
really believes in its future.

THE SEMAPHORE 







Osmena Respondini::? 

Led and spearheaded by The 
MAIL, the Filipinos in America 
have been giving their views and 
suggestions on different Philippine 
oroblems, including the govern- 
ment personnel. 

At first some Filipinos who 
don’t know what their rights and 
duties are as citizens in a democ- 
racy thought it was unpatriotic, 
even treasonable, to be frank to 
their government. These Filipinos 
sought to stop and discourage ’The 
MAIL in discharging its civic duty 
in a democracy. They were aided 
by government officials whose in- 
terest is to shield the government, 
including its inefficiencies, irregu- 
larities and unpatriotic acts. 

Today it is different. The MAIL 
is recognized as having done a goo(J 
job of democratising the govern- 
ment and its officials. And these 
officials are now responding and 
for the first time they are recog- 
nizing the Filipinos in America. 
Before they simply ignored them, 
high-hatted them and considered 



Part of the head table at the banquet for Sgt. Cabals. Left to right: Mlomeno Ma<'asaet, Frank Bolima, them as nobodies and harmless in- 
IVfrs. Bolima, Sgt. Cabals. I dividuals. 



Take the case of President Ser- 
gio Osmena himself. He never paid 
any attention before to the Fili- 
pinos in America. He never even 
answered respectful letters from 
Filipinos. Now he pays attention 
to the Filipinos in America. The 
MAIL has had a great deal to do 
with it. 

A few davs ago. before he flew 
to Manila, he held a tea partv to 
which he ^pvited several hundred 
Filipinos. Did he ever do that be- 
fore? 

In Washington, he visited Sen- 
ator Eastland, of Mississippi, and 
asked him to work for the passage 
of the bill for the naturalization 
of Filipinos in the United States. 
Did he ever do anything like that 
before ? 

He is now careful not to have 
anv Filipinos in the government 
who are not liked by the Filipino 
masses, and today a swell-headed, 
do-nothing, dull-headed or grafting 
official as well as misfits like 
Laurel and Madrigal will be yank- 
ed out of the service. 

We are making progress, al- 
though late!

Col. Peralta Resumes 
Former Command 



DINGLE. ILEILE, Philippines, 
(FPA) — Col. Macario Peralta, Jr., 
of guerrilla fame, has returned to 
his former command, the 52nd In-

headquarters at Dingle, Iloilo. 
During the absence of Col. Peralta 
when he went to the General Staff 
and Command School at Ft. Leav- 
enworth, Kansas, in the United 
States, the Emergency Currency 
Committee of the Army went 
through his books and found them 
to be in perfect order, all sums of 
money accounted for, and his 
books were judged to be the best 
kept of all Philippine guerrilla 
organizations. The Committee has 
asked for an accounting of the 
money turned over to Gov. Tomas

Lopez Candidacy 
Announced at Senate 



WASHINGTON — Major Pedro 
Lopez, member of the Rehabilita- 
tion Commission, is the only Fili- 
pino in the entire history of Philip- 
pine-American relations who had 
“the luxury” to announce his can- 
didacy for the Philippine Congress 
at a Senate hearings here. Asked 
questions on the payment of war 
damages to Filipinos not only in 
the Major’s constituency in Cebu 
but also throughout the country, 
Lopez answered firmly that h^was 
for the payment to the Cebuanos 
first as “ a candidate for re-elec- 
tion to the Philippine Congress.” 
The quick-minded Senator Tydings 
said, “I understand, Mr. Congress- 



man. 



o 



Lest We Forget 

President Sergio Osmena, 
who has been in Washington 
for two months, had a great op- 
portunity to prove that he was 
for good government and for 
the common people. He had be- 
fore him a bill passed by the 
Philippine Congress which pro- 
vides for the payment of Cong- 
ressmen for the 3 years during 
which the Japs were in control 
of the Philippines and only for 
46 days for the rest of the offi- 
cials and employees of the gov- 
ernment who received small sal- 
aries. President Osmena, in- 
stead of vetoing the hill, ap- 
proved it. Thus he is a party to 
that salary grab deal. And he 
revealed himself as nothing but 
on ordinary {Mlitician whose 
first concern Is his own person- 
al political fortimc and not the 
welfare of the people and the 
cause of democracy and good 
government. He thereby loses 
-any claim to the support of the 
Filipino i>cople and the respect 
of the American people. He is 
the greatest provocateur of rev- 
olution and the deadliest enemy 
of the government of, by and 
for the people. 



Filipino Labor Be Allowed Entrance 
In United States Basing Similar 
To Importation of Mexicans 



SALINAS (PPA) — The recently initiated movement to iuj. 
port Filipino laborers to the United States began to take definite 
form when representatives of the Filipino Labor Supply Associ- 
ation, Salinas Valley growers and shippers, and Governor Tomaj 
Confesor, member of the Philippine Rehabilitation Commission 
met at a luncheon here on November 8 to discuss ways ai4 

beans of effecting the recruiting.^^ 



transporting, and entrance of Fili- 
pino labor into this country. 

After a well conducted discus- 
sion of the issues involved in the 
project, the growers and shippers 
realized that it is a matter to be 
taken up with the federal govern- 
ment in Washington, the question 
of immigration laws being the 
paramount obstacle. . 

It has been suggested that Fili- 
pino labor' may be allowed en- 
trance into the United States on 
a basis similar to the importation 
of Mexican nationals, although 
some modifications will be made. 

Under the proposed labor impor- 
tation, each laborer will be re- 
quired to go through a rigid phys- 
ical examination before being sign- 
ed up for agricultural labor in 
this country. The proposed length 
of residence will be three years 
with an option to stay one more 
year. 

It has also been suggested, and 
it will probably be included when 
the project becomes a reality, that 
a certain percentage of the earn- 
ings will be deducted each pay-day 
to be deposited in the laborer’s 
name to ensure an amount of sav- 
ings. 

Because of the adaptability of 
Filipino laborers in the highly sci- 
entific agricultural industry here, 
and the pleasant and profitable ex- 
perience of employers, the same 
labor is still highly in demand, and 
specific provisions have also been 
suggested as to how to keep them 
in the area during the tenure of 
their contract. The growers and 
shippers group offered a solution 
in the year-round jobs in the val- 
ley. The limited acreage of small 
farmers was no problem, inasmuch 
as bigger farming companies could 
employ them whenever another 
crop is ready for harvesting. 

In the wake of reported wide- 
spread unemployment in the 
Philippines. Governor Confesor ex- 
pressed confidence that approval 
of the exportation of Filipino la- 
bor by the Philippine government 
would not be much of a problem. 
It is his belief that in the rehabili- 
tation of the Philippines, a great 
number of Filipinos here on con- 
tract labor and spending the 
greater part of their earnings 
home would be of great help in 
swelling the national income and, 
therefore, aiding greatly in the 
reconstruction of the country. 

'The dismissal of 400,000 public 
works employees in the Philip- 
pines gives an idea of a possible 
source of labor recruits, according 
to persons interested in the pro- 
ject. The number is swelled when 
600,000 unrecognized guerrillas 
will be disbanded. 

There being an oversupply of la- 
bor in the Philippines, Governor 
Confesor’s contention leaves the 
growers and shippers the problem 
of easing the inunigration laws of 
this country preparatory to the re- 
cruiting of Filipino labor. 'They, 
however, promised that a cam- 
paign will be launched to effect 
the change by law if necessary. 

The meeting was instigated on 
the suggestion of labor supply re- 
presentatives when Governor Con- 
fesor came here to surv^ey condi- 
tions obtaing among Filipino com- 
munities of the Pacific Coast. 

Filipino Labor Supply Associ- 



ation representatives present H 
the meeting were Mr. M. R. Ga£. 
cia, president: Mr, F. S. Maraj»; 
and Mr. D. C. Manuel. *

I

Beyond Understanding 



I'l 






Information from Washington 
to the effect that one of the gre^- A 



est, if not the greatest, FilipinB;% 
heroes of the war is going to t 
sign in disgust. He is Major 
Villamor, No. 1 Filipino ace aai 
the first man “to return” to tk 
Philippines after the surrender d 
Bataan and Corregidor. 

Everytime his case is brougfel 
up, Filipinos always say that it 
Carlos Romulo is a General, ViBi. 
mor should be a Generalissimo.* 
They also say that “if Villamor ji 
only a Major, Romulo shoud be i 
mere Sergeant.” That’s how 2 
goes. Filipinos talk that way. 
can’t help it. 

The case of Villamor is really^ 
most serious reflection on 
Philippine government. It rev 
in its most lurid light the favonr- 
ism and indifference to persoirt^ 
merit on the part of high offidak. 
It is particularly killing beao^ 




this is the time,. after a most 
structive war, that public offir^^^ 



should at last decide to 
real men, real patriots and 
Filipinos. 

Villamor probably will be drSj

PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION Q 
CHEAPENED BY ROMULO 



SAN FRANCISCO — From 
of the Filipino officials accompBEf- 
ing President Osmena it has bea 
learned that Commissioner Carla 
P. Romulo presented to Congre»' 
a very ridiculous proposition, th# 
is. that all the 20 add provisioa 
of the pending Philippine bill abort 
sugar, coconut oil. abaca and what 
not shall be incorporated into tk 
Philippine Constitution, bfca, 
countrymen, have you heard oft 
Constitution with such provisions? 
What went through the head of 
Gen. Romulo to cheapen our Cot 
stitution like that? 

Incidentally, the very definite 
impression that we received art 
only from the Filipino offidali 
with President Osmena but alp - 
from the Filipino ladies witii to 
is that Romulo has so many critio ^ 
and enemies that he will not beii p 
office long, especially when the 
Roxas followers in the Philippins 
have started the move to have hip 
unseated as Commissioner. 

From Manila, accordingto one d 
the officials, came the ne\%’s that 
a former Filipino Colonel in thi 
Philippine Army and now with the 
Federal Government on duty & 
Manila is urging an investigatia 
of how Romulo w’as promoted ^ 
General and how he got his many 
medals and decorations. His pw- 
motions and citations have brok« 
down the Filipino moral.
