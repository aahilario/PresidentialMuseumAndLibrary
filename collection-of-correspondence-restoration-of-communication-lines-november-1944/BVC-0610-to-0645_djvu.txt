After verification has been made, I found out that the 
following post-offices are also in need of canceling post- 
marking (Dispatching) and receiving postmarking stamps in 
addition to Tacloban as per our requisition dated November £ 
26, 1944 i

Capoocan, Leyte, Philippines

Pan Hi quel, Leyte, Philippines 


All of the above post-offices nave either been looted 
or destroyed by fire; hence their supplies and records in- 
cluding postmarking stamps are no v/ missing. 

• 

In view of this, I earnestly**' • b that requisition 
be made to supply them wir . le necessary postru . tamps, 

preferably steel, but if steel is not available, rubber 
stamps with complete dates may be utiliybd. for^the purpose.

Sir : 

A® we have now sufficient postage stamp© t® distri- 
bute to the different post-offices which have. not yet boon 
reopened » it is my plan to reopei i tn©ia as soon as possible « 
But before this can b©. done# it would b© neceaa&ry t© make 
arrangement as to how the different post-office® can be 
connected thru a system of mail rout®© m before the out- 
break of the war* 

For this purpose it shall be necessary to hav© at 
least three sail trucks to transport tbo mails to the dif- 
ferent towns ©f Leyte In accordance with the following 

proposed nail routes % 

I* Mail Route "Tacloban-Baybay" via Palo# Tanauan# 
Dagami# Bur&uen 0 Duleg and Abuyog* On© truck 
is needed t© transport the mails between these 
places# two ©r three times weekly* Th© letter- 
carriers at Tolosa ^nd La Pas may be required 
to carry the mails to Tanauan and Dulag respec- 
tively by either foot or by hors©* 

A 

2. Mail Route "Taeloban-Omoc” via Alangalang# 

Jar© 9 Garigara and Capoocan* Chi© xaail truck is 
also needed to transport the mails on this rout©* 
The letter-carrier© at Pastrana a San Miguel and 
Barug© may b© required t© carry th© mail© to Pal©® 
Alangalang and Carigara respectively by either 
foot or by hors©* 

5. Mail Rout© "Baybay-Libagoa" via Inopaean, Hin- 
daag 9 Hilongos # Bat©# Matalom, Maesla# Macrohon, 
Maiitbog and Sogod, also by mail truck* 

To th© other town© not mentioned above# mails m.j 
be carried by employing Mail Messengers from on© ©ffi@© 
t© another who may utilize sailboat© or horses to trans- 
port the mails© „ A ^ 

As can be aeon from the above# th© most important 
thing Is to provide the means of transporting the mail© 




J 


Pag® ® 8 «* 


which ©an ©aly b© done by Moans of motor vehicles, Is

Qm® this is solved, it would be as ©asy matter to reopsn

office quarter© including supplies and record® were entire- 
ly reduced to ashes and in certain ©aees they h&v© been

SUBJjjCTj Application for the position of postoffice inspector 


Major-General Basilio J. Valdez 

Secretary of National Defense and Communications 

Tacloban, Leyte 


Sirs 


Anticipating that there vdll be need for postoffice inspectors 
in the near future in our Government, I have the honor to apply to fill 
one such position. 

I qualified in the following Civil Service examinations? 


Starting as a student operator in the Bureau of Posts in Decem- 
ber, 19$? I saw service in the Philippine Commonwealth as radio- 
telegraph operator, postmaster, clerk and as assistant chief of sec- 
tion. In October, 1941, I transferred to the Philippine Signal 
Depot, U. S. Army but, finding an opening in the Budget Commission, 

I transferred again to that Office where I stayed only until the 
Japs occupied Manila. 

By force of extreme necessity— that is, I was broke, sick with 
malaria and with a family to feed— I sought employment in the Bureau 
of the Budget and Accounts of the Philippine government during the 
time of the Japs as clerk and bookkeeper beginning November 2, 1942, 
and subsequently, as a relief worker in March, 1944, with station 
in Tacloban, Leyte, up to the time of our redemption by the American 
forces. 

At present, I am employed in the U. S. Labor Office. 

I am a first year pre-law student, a typist, have knowledge of 
bookkeeping, accounting and has specialized in all sorts of postal 
business together with its rules and regulations. 

Regarding my character, behavior and other personal circumstances, 

I may refer you to Mons. M. Mascarinas, Bishop of Palo, Mr. Juan Perez, ' 
Mr. Jose Brillo and Mr. Severo Villegas.

Civilian Postal Service- : Mr. Andres V. Corpus was ap- 
pointed as acting postmaster of abuyog by the Commonwealth I 

Government effective 7 December 1944. Mr. Corpuz has no way 
to transport the mail to Tacloban as he was directed to do 
on each Monday and Thursday. This unit will adsist the 
Postmaster in every way. It is recommended, however, that 
in future cases satisfactory arrangements for transporting 
of civilian mail be made prior rather than subsequent to 
the order requiring opening of a post office.
