to ti^q Quezon Momorial Cenmittco, 
Manila, 

Gentlemen t 

It seems to mo Quite premature to mako the following snggos- 
tieo to the Commit tco , but j believe 'tacit an idea nh6"ld now be 
t crmed of tno ns*<ulnose. r boaef its and new services that the pcoplo 
will constantly enjoy from the monument Of President Qneson to 
which I now propoeo that the none of "Queson Memorial Foundation" 
be given, X boll eve that with the addition of the word "Founda- 
tion* thonime of the Committee will bo "better attained as it is 
the desire of many and it le favorably reeeiyod by the people in- 
asmuch ae such name is mere appropriate. 

It ie* theroforo, necessary to make on early dofinite state- 
nest on this point so that this name may be used by us as the 
basis for ear appeals to the public* in the different forms of pro- 
pagandas In our let tore, leaflets, pamphlets, posters, cinema pro- 
3octions, radio programs » and in this way the name of "Quezon 
Foundation" will be psychologically usod to advantage in said 
propaganda by extolling tic merits and benofits that will be de- 
rived from the "Quezon Memorial Foundation*" There is no doubt 
that it will bo an effective moons in the appeal to tho people 
by the subcommittees even in the remotest barrios* In eolieit- 
ing contributions* the mention of a "Quoson Foundation," whioh 
will contain conference halls, objects and relies of groat cul- 
tural value and the mausoleum will arouse popular interest, al- 
though the mole mention, of the name of the late Pre Bidont will 
bo more thou sufficient for the Committee to bo optimistic in 
this drive) bat in order to avoid any unforeseen eironmstancos 
whit h may arise and affect the maehinory of our organization 
whioh may result in the failure of our estimates, I believe that 
the inclusion of the wfrd "Foundation" will giro the impression 
that thore will be ample jeSsibiHty of seenring sufficient re- 
souroos ft* its eontinuod existence so that the activities of 
bonofieenss may be maintained continuously in such a way that 
as the asms of Quezon Memorial alone already implies majesty, 
veneration and culture, the saps feelings will bo doubly reflected 
under tho material and spiritual point of view if the name Of 
"iuoeon Memorial Foundation, B whioh is more ample and more speci- 
fic, is adopted, 

•Quezon City," "Quezon Bridge," "Quezon Institute," ana, 
"Quezon Boulevard* are in themselves monuments to the groat 
leader* Bat the; Quezon Foundation is entirely difforont from 
them because of the foot that it is going to be erected witib 
money voluntarily donated by the pooplo, and therefore, it will 
be his crowning monumont, for the practical boneflta to bo de- 
rived therefrom in the form of cultural, social* seicntifie and 
spiritual assets will constitute a e ontinued and perpetual blessing 
to his people* 

It is proposed that study be mads of the possibility of or* • 
ganizlmg a non-stock corporation that will afterwards take charge 
of the administration of the "Quezon Memorial Foundation, " mot 
only to provide it with all t at is necessary fo* its preserva* 
tion and to introduce improvements in the building and in its

ootttonta, but also that it may do its boat to propogato its pur- 
poses and to carry thorn out into practice, especially oota of 
benofieonse, whioh functions will greatly holp la tho activities 
of tho government itself, without duplicating tho worlt of tho 
Soft Cross and other siuilur insti tut Ions. And under tho moral, 
social, and spiritual points of viow, thoy will constituto tho 
example Ho. 1 of its class until philanthropic works of permanent

2, The publicity offioor must prepare in advance a program 
or schedule of the dates agroed upon with each newspaper through 
the Press Bnroau for tho publication of those statements whioh 
will bo of vital importance in arousing popular enthusiasm on tho 
alms of the drive, 

4. The publicity officer, whllo collecting tho written state-

communicating with Pr. Ve Iosco for the purpose of coordinating 
and systematically preparing in advance ill the publicity plan*

beneficent works spooially, for example, tho medical aid to b© 
rondorcd to thoso suffering from spooifio diseases, to tho ohildron 
of parents without moans, tho social and matorial promotion (in a 
spooifio way) of tho laboring classes; it will fostor tho interest 
of tho privileged classes in the comprehension of bilatorol bone- 
fits of philanthrophy and altruism with a view to accelerating tho 
progress of tho people and their omorgoaoo from the ruins and ra- 
vages of war. 

11. The publicity of floor is also roqnostod to prepare now 
different forms and stylOB of propaganda leaflets from whioh the 
most appropriate ones will bo soleotcd. This was one of the moans 
suggested by President Roxas. 

12. It is recommended to tho Exooutivo Committee to request 
tho management of tho air companies FEATI and PAL to donate two 
pormanont passes for tho Chairman or the Vico-Chairman or in thoir 
stead tho Manager and ono sooretory to mako trips to tho provinces

President Quezon himself and through the Governor ! s unqualified 
support and help we have lately been honored with the receipt of 
books, magazines, pamphlets and other reading matters donated ty 
the chiefs of tBe various divisions of the Provincial Government 
and prominent persons of the province « 

It is our consuming desire to push the project through 
until the same is ma.de a living reality, lie realize, as much as 
others do, that trials and handicaps ^are before us; but we ar un- 
daunted • We will carry on in spite of deterrents • 

In this connection, we have a feeling that this Blatter 
should be brought to your kind attention primarily because we feel 
the inexplicable urge to do so, and because we believe that you

to the fact that she gave birth, but the Manager, Dr. Pedro 
J, Velasco certified ner record as having rendered full time 
service during the period and Mrs. Araceli Velasco received 
her salary for that period; 

3. That a housemaid of Dr. Velasco by the name of 
Leonila Abella was on the pay-roll of the Quezon Memorial 
Committee and received therefrom salary on the pretext that 
she helped packing papers and materials df Quezon Memorial 
Committee for shipment to the provinces, but the truth is 
that she never rendered any work for the Committee; 

4. That as an employee of the Quezon Memorial Commit- 
tee I was given work as checker at night in the Del Rosario- 
Cabanell Boxing Bout with extra compensation of Twenty Pesos 
{ 1*20. 00) a night. My "pays" and those of sixteen other per- 
sons were not given us buty were pocketed by Dr« Pedro J. 
Velasco; and 

That I know these facts to be positively true from my 
personal knowledge and experience. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto signed my name this 
27th day of June, 1948, Manila, Philippines.

The Quezon Memorial Committee 
Manila 

Sirs: 

Supplementing my letter dated May 14, containing charges 
against Dr, P. J. Velasco, manager of Quezon Memorial Fund 
Drive, I have the honor to submit this memorandum: 

Charge No. 1 

Kt. VELASCO INSTEAD OF HELPING OR ENCOURAGING THE PROMOTER 
G. G. LEDONIO IN HIS EFFORTS TO RAISE MONET FOR THE QUEZON MEMO- 
RIAL FUND, IS EXERTING ALL EFFORTS TO DISCREDIT HIM BEFORE THE 
EIES OF THE PUBLIC, BY WRITING LETTERS TO ALL GOVERNMENT AGEN- 
CIES AND SEMI -GOVERNMENT CORPORATIONS TO FURNISH HEM 17ITH A 
LIST OF THE NUMBER OF TICKETS WHICH MR. LEDONIO AND HIS HELPERS 
HAVE SOLD TO THEM. AND THE TONE OF HIS LETTERS IS SUCE AS TO 
REFLECT ON THE INTEGRITY AND HONESTY OF THE PROMOTER • 

Mr* Ledonio in response to the appeal of the Committee for 
cooperation from civic-spirited citizens to help swell the Quezon 
Memorial Fund, agreed to promote benefit cines for said Fund with 
the exhibition of his own film, HEME NA BUNSO KO, throughout the 
Philippines. The Chairman agreed to the said proposition and 
Mr. Ledonio held the premier showing of this film at the Manila 
Grand Opera House on March 13, 194.8, After tho show Mr. Ledonio 
sent to the Manager of tho Committoo statoments of receipts and 
expenses and also a statement of tho amount that has not boen 
collected from the purchases of admission tickets. 

Not contended with the said statement, although according 
thereto there was the sum of f*76$.00 as share of the Quezon Memo* 
rial Fund and also of a similar amount from the accounts receiv- 
able, Dr. Velasco has boen requiring Mr. Ledonio to submit a list 
of the persons who hove bought tickets* 

When Mr. Ledonio failed to submit such list because there qas 
no such condition in tho agreement of promotion, Mr. Velasco arbi- 
trarily and with justification and with intention of discrediting 
Mr. Ledonio, wrote to several provincial governors, provincial 
treasurers and provincial auditors asking them to suspend all 
the benefits promoted by Mr. Ledonio. 

This arbitrary action of Dr* Velasco resulted to the pre- 
judice of Mr # Ledonio because he was been obstructed in his pro- 
motion of benefit cines especially in the provinces of Tarlac 
and Nueva Eteija* When ho was informed that Mr A Ledonio was pro- 
moting benefit cines in the province of Tarlac, ho sent a 
representative there to ask tho governor to stop all such benefit 
cines. Those acts of Dr. Volasco greatly impaired the activities 
of Mr. Ledonio and the success of this promoter, who invested a 
large capital in his film, MEME N4 BUNSO KO^ Tho manager of the 
Quezon Memorial Fund has no right to impose so many unreasonable 
restrictions upon tho promoter becaueo tho Committee has not in- 
vested capital in such promotion and whatover share is given to 
tho Quezon Memorial Fund in accordance with tho agreement it _is 
considered a donation by Mr. Lodonio to the Cfcozon Memorial Fund, 

Dr. Volasco has no reason for doubting the transactions of 
Mr f Ledonio because tho provincial auditor and the provincial 
troasuror and tho municipal troasurcr of tho municipalities whoro 




- 2 - 



benefit cines arc held ore authorized to chock the account of 
every show and to toko hold of tho Quezon Memorial Fund share. 
So far no illegality has boon committed by Mr. Lodonio nor he de- 
frauded in any way the Quezon Memorial Fund. 

Chargo No. 2 

THE MANAGEMENT OF THE QUEZON MEMORIAL FUND DRIVE IS UTERLY 
FAILING IN THE DRIVE BECAUSE AFTER THREE YEARS OF CAMPAIGN ONLY 
THE SUM OF ABOUT ?350,000.00 HAS BEEN COLLECTED. 

It was reported in tho newspapers that already P1,000,000.00 
has boon collected for tho Quezon Memorial Fund but this is un- 
true* If it was Dr. Volasco who furnished the information to the 
press and to tho chairman of tho committee, he was only boosting 
and this misinformation is prejudicial to tho good name of the 
Committee and of its chairman, tho Honor ablo Jose C. Zulueta, 
Secretary of tho Interior* 

The books of tho Treasurer show that only about F350, 000.00 
has so far boon collected for tho Quozon Momorial Fund. 

And all of this amount of P350,000.00 cannot be credited to 
the management of tho Quozon Momorial Fund because tho Department 
of Education has colloctcd Pl$0>COoOO thru the Division^ Super- 
intendents of Schools and teachers -without the intervention of 
the manager, about P37,000.00 arc the proceeds of the benofit 
horse races authorized by His Excolloncy, the President of tho 
Philippines and tho P46,000„00 r<as donated by Mrs. Aurora Quezon^ 
to tho Committeo out of tho procoods of tho shoeing of the techni- 
color film of tho late Presidents funoral in the United States. 
This amount fcotalfe S*26?vC0ttCO anfl^tloaue^n^tKL'sr amount** ffecn-- 
B??0,000.00 only P37,000 c 00 has boon collectod by the iranagemont 
proper of tho Quezon Momorial Fund Drivo in thros yoars. This 
small amount cannot be credited entirely to Dr. Velasco, because 
Dr. Artemio Nabor as Executive Secretary, was the first roal 
manager of the drive fo;r almost two yoars so that we can say 
that 5*43,500.00 has been collected during the management of Dr. 
Volasco since he was appointed on April, 194-7. 

I am onclosing herewith a statement from the National Treasu- 
rer which supports tho allegation made in this charge. If I cited 
in my letter in the case of Gov. Castro it is to show that Dr« 
Velasco lacks the necessary tact in his dealings with civic- 
spirited people who are willing to cooperate with him; Dr. Volasco 
is extremely suspicious of anybody believing that every person 
who cooperates with him is a racketeer. This in a great way con- 
tributes to the failure of Dr. Velasco in his task.

PROTESTING AGAINST SO MANY PROPAGANDA MATERIALS AND THE DEPARTMENT 
SECRETARIES AND BUREAU DIRECTORS AND MANAGERS OF GOVERNMENT-OWNED 
CORPORATIONS ARE NOW TIRED OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF PROPAGANDA, MATER- 
IALS BEING SENT BY DR. VELASCO ONE AFTER ANOTHER. 

THESE PROPAGANDA MATERIALS INSTEAD OF BOOSTING THE CAMPAIGN 
ARB PREJUDICING IT BECAUSE THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT PROPAGANDA 
MATERIALS WHICH DO NOT COST THEM MORE THAN f*1.00, CONSIDER THAT 
THE? HAVE ALREADY CONIRIBUTED TO THE QUEZON MEMORIAL FUND. THE 
RED CROSS COLLECTED P 500^000 .00 IN ONE MONTH AND YET THERE WERE 
NO PROPAGANDA MATERIALS. 



HI. VELASCO PRACTICES NEPOTISM BECAUSE MRS. ARACELI V. VELASCO. 
WHO IS REALLY MRS. ARACELI A. VELASCO, THE WIFE OF DR. MARIO VELASCO, 
HIS SON, SECURED HER APPOINTMENT AS SOCIAL SECRETARY WITH P150.00. 
SHE HAS BEEN FOR ONE YEAR IN THE OFFICE. THE CHXHHAN SIGNED HER 
APPOINTMENT PROBABLY WITHOUT KNOWING THAT SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER-IN- 
LAW OF DR. VELASCO. DR. VELASCO DISMISSED TOO LADY TYPISTS TO GIVE 
WAY TO HIS DAUGHTER-IN-LAW. THEY ABB MISSES MONDRAGON AND CELO. 

THEN DR. VELASCO EMPLOYED ALSO TOO DAUGHTERS-IN-LAW, WIVES OF 
TOO OF HIS SONS, AS HELPERS AND ALSO A HOUSE MAID TO PACK MATERIALS 
TO BE SHIPPED TO THE PROVINCES. 

ALL HIS THREE DAUGHTERS-IN-LAW ARE LIVING IN HIS HOUSE WHERE 
THE OFFICE OF THE QUEZON MEMORIAL FUND DRIVE IS INSTALLED AND ALSO 
THE HOUSE MAID. THIS IS SHAMEFUL NEPOTISM. 

A STATEMENT OF THE AUDITOR OF THE QUEZON MEMORIAL COMMITTEE IS 
HERETO ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT B WHICH SHOWS THE NAMES OF THE TOO 
DAUGHTERS-IN-LAW OF DR. VELASCO WHO WERE EMPLOYED AS HIS HELPERS . 
AND ALSO HIS HOUSE MAID. 



DR. VELASCO INSTEAD OF GIVING THE PRINTING WORK TO THE BUREAU 
OF PRINTING WHICH IS AN OFFICIAL INSTITUTION OF THE GOVERNMENT GAVE 
IT TO CARMELO & BAUERMANN. WE DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY THE REASON FOR 
THIS BUT WE KNOW THAT THE BUREAU OF PRITING SHOULD DO THE WORK 
BUT IT DOES NOT GIVE COMMISSION TO THE ONE WHO IS GIVING THEM THE 
WORK, WHILE PRIVATE PRINTING RESTABLISHMENTS GIVE GOOD COMMISSION. 



DE. VELASCO GET COMPLIMENTARY TICKETS FROM ALL THE PROMOTERS 
OF BOXING BOUTS WITH THE PRETEXT THAT THEY ARE FOR THE QUEZON MEMO- 
RIAL COMMITTEE. BUT .HE GIVES ONLY TO A FEW OF THE MEMBERS OF THE 
COMMITTEE, WHAT DOES HE DO WITH THE REST? LET HIM ENSWER. 



DR C VELASCO IMPOSES UPON PROMOTERS OF BOXING BENEFITS THE 
OBLIGATION TO PAI CHECKERS OF THE QUEZON MEMORIAL COMMITTEE AT THE

HEREWITH ARE ENCLOSED WHAT DR. VELASCO CALLED CHART NO. * 



OR PLAN OF LOCAL COMMITTEES. I CHALLENGE DR. VELASCO TO SHOW THAT 
THIS IS A DEAD CHART. I DO NOT KNOW OP ANY CIVIC OR SOCIAL ORGANI- 
ZATION COMMITTEE NOR PROFESSIONAL SUB-COMMITTEE, AND IF THERE ARE 
ANY THEY ARE HOT DOING ANYTHING FOR THE CAMPAIGN AND YET DR. VELASCO 
SPENT MUCH FOR THE PRINTING OF THOUSANDS OF CHARTS. ENCLOSED HERE- 
WITH IS THE SAMPLE CF THE CHRISTMAS GREETING PRINTED WITHOUT THE 
AUTHORITY OF THE QUE20N MEMORIAL COMMITTEES BY CARMELO & BAUERMANN. 
THOUSANDS OF THESE CHRISTMAS CARDS WERE SENT TO DIFFERENT INSTITU- 
TUIONS FOR SALE AT ABOUT P3 # 00 A DOZEN BUT VERY FEW HAVE BEEN PAID 
FOR UNTIL NOW* 

Dr. Velascc should be required to inform the Committee in his 
answer to his Memorandum, how much has he received from the Filipi- 
nos in Hawaii and California as payment of the thousands of Christ- 
mas cards sent there by him. He should also be required to inform 
the Committee how much he paid the Carmelo & Bauer mann in printing 
the so called Christmas cards. The only importance of these Christ- 
mas cards is to show that Dr. Velasco published in the Manila Times 
an article entitled "Roosevelt and Quezon linked by Destiny". The 
effect of this articles appears in the place on the top of the set 
describing the propaganda materials but this has no effect at all 
if only to boost the name of the r.onager because he himself is 
giving prominence to the work. 

Dr. Velasco should also be required to inform the Committee as 
to how many thousands have been printed of this sheet describing 
propaganda materials. Copy of which is inclosed as Exhibit D # 

Charge No. 10 

DR. VELASCO IS TREATING THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNORS AS HIS SUBOR- 
DINATES AS SHOWN IN THE PRINTED NOTICE PASTED ON THE BLACKBOARD IN 
THE DEPARTMENT CF THE INTERIOR WHICH READS AS FOLLOWS: : 

M Hon. Governors: 

"Please take at the management office at 643 Legarda 
your tabulation sheets for use in your campaign. n 

'•Management 1 * 

The governors fooling offended did not go to take the sheets 
at the Que son Memorial Fund Drive office . This notice was posted 
about April 24 when many governors came to Manila to attend the 
funeral of the late President. Some of them upon, seeing this 
notice just laughed. This is one of the reasons why Dr. Velasco 
cannot secure the full support of tho Provincial Governors many 
of whom are aot interested in this campaign. 

I request that in answering this memorandum Dr. Velasco 
should be required to explain why so little headway has taken 
place in the drive although he has wholly spent much in printing, 
in salaries of employees and helpers. 

Respectfully submitted*

CONFIDENTI AL REPORTS 



Charge No. 11 

In boxing promotions for the Quezon Memorial Fund, Dr. 
Velasco invariably makes two kinds of contracts signed by him 
and by the promoter. In one of the contracts it is ride to ap- 
pear that the promoter gives 10% of the net proceeds to the 
Quezon Memorial Fund, while in the other contract it is made to 
appear that the promoter is only a technical assistant employed 
by the Committee on account of his experience in boxing promo- 
tions iB given a salary for his work. 

This has been discovered by the Collector of Internal 
Revenue who wrote him a letter asking for explanaition why 
there are two (2) contracts in the case of Mr* Felix Caliwag, 
promoter of the Tut-Naven fight* 

In answer to the Collector of Internal Revenue on August 
26, 1948, he gives the following explanation: 

w That the first contract dated April 5, 1948, 
was signed because Mr. Caliwag would promote the 
fight himself promosing to give 10J6 of the net pro- 
ceeds to the Quezon Memorial Fund.* 1 

But that one month later, that is, on May 5, 1948, Mr. Caliwag, 
says Dr. Velasco, want back to him saying that under the first 
contract he would lose in the venture because he was informed 
that the amusement taxes would be collected by the Bureau of 
Internal Revenue only on the share of the Quezon Memorial Fund 
and so the second contract was signed* 

The explanation is unsatisfactory and against common 
sense. If Mr. Caliwag and Dr. Velasco made another contract on 
May 5, 1948, we afeked why was not the first contract cancelled? 

You will notice that under the second contract the Quezon 
Memorial Committee is the principal promoter and the promoter 
is only a technical assistant with a fixed salary, the amount 
depending upon the net proceeds of the affair. So that under 
the Second contract there is a good chance for the Manager 
to make money for himself without the knowledge of the Chair- 
man or of the Committee because if he is asked by the Chairman 
or by the Committee to produce the contract with Mr. Caliwag, 
he would produced the first contract whereby the Committee has 
10% of the net proceeds and this 10% would be turned over to the 
Treasurer of the Philippines. But under the second contract, 
supposing that the net proceeds of the affair is P15,OC0.0O and 
he gives a salary of F5,000.00 to the promoter, then he would 
get 10% of 1*10,000.00, frhat is PI, 000.00 and give it to the 
Quezon Memorial Fund. .How, where is he going to put the t>9*000? 

The existence, therefore, of two contracts for every 
boxing promotion gives way to many chances of committing fraud 
or graft and, therefore, I request that his additional charge 
be referred to the National Bureau of Investigation for veri- 
fication. In case the contracts do not appear in the sealed 
files of the Quezon Memorial Committee, they can be found in the 
hands of the Collector of Internal Revenue. 

Charge No. 12 

The championship fight between Tirso del Rosario and 
Manuel Ortiz staged at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum was also for 



the benefit of the Quezon Memorial Fund.. The share of the fund 
was turned over to the Treasurer of the Philippines* 

But I wish to invite your attention, Mr. Chairman, thai 
Dr* Velasco had another contract with the promoter, Mr. Ted 
Lewin, to film the fight and to exhibit it in the important 
theatres of the Philippines and abroad and that a certain per- 
centage of the proceeds of the showing of this film would go to 
the Quezon Memorial Fund* 

I am not sure of the exact date but it Aay be one or two 
weeks after the boxing fight. The film was shown at the State 
Theatre in Manila to full capacity for five consecutive days. 

And presumably, it has been shown in many other theatres 
here and abroad* But in the records of the National Treasurer 
there does not appear any amount representing the share of 
the Quezon Memorial F und in the proceeds of the showing of the 
film* 

I would also request that the NBI be requested to see the 
file of the Quezon Memorial Committee about the contract altho, 
it is believed, that contracts of this nature are not kept in 
the official file of the office of the <$KJ but in the private 
file of Dr. Velasco in his own room. At any rate, on the sup- 
position that such contract cannot be located, the National 
Bureau of Investigation may contact Mr* Ernesto Rufino or the 
Manager or the Secretary of the Corporation managing the State 
Theatre and ask for a letter written by Dr. Velasco to Mr*. 
*nif ino or the Manager informing him that under a contract of 
the promoter of the Tirso del Rosario and Manuel Ortiz fight, 
the Quezon Memorial c ommittee was entitled to a certain percen- 
tage and that the manager of the theatre should not deliver 
the share of the Quezon Memorial Committee to Ted Lewin or his 
representative. He should hold it in his office until called 
for by the management of the Quezon Memorial Fund*. If this 
letter can be found in the files of the corporation managing 
the State Theatre, I suggest that a photostatic copy of some 
be made as evidence of this charge* 

Charge No. 13 

From January 17 to 31. 1948, Mrs* Araceli Alameda Velas- 
co, so-called social secretary, file-clerk and accountant, 
gave birth in the house of Dr. Velasco her father-in-law; 
during that period she could not and did not perform her du- 
ties with (JfflC, and yet she was paid her full salary during her 
inability to work as shown by the time record on file with the 
payroll in the National Treasurer of the Philippines* 

In support of this charge, I am enclosing herewith an 
affidavit of Mr. Prudencio Jiraeno, an employee of the Quezon 
Memorial Fund Office dated June 27, 1948. I suggest that the 
National Bureau of Investigation be requested to investigate 
this charge. I suggest also that another employee, Mr. Antonio 
Mationg be questioned by the Bureau of National Investigation 
on this point* As corroborative evidence the National **ureau of 
Investigation should secure a certified copy of the birth cer- 
tificate in the office of the Civil Registrar of Manila of a 
child bom within January 17 to 31> 1948 - male baty - surnamed 
Velasco Alameda, son of Mario Velasco and Araceli Alameda. 



3 



I have hi so information that Mrs, firaceli Alameda Velasco 
absented herself f*om the office at least twice to vist Ye* 
husband in the provinces of Ilocos Norfce and Ilocos Sur where 
Dr. Mario Velasco, her husband was employed with the United 
States Relief Organization. She was given a free pass by her 
father-in-law, granted by the Santiago Sambrano Transporation 
Co. and stayed one week each time and yet her absences during 
these two weeks more or less do not appear in her time records 
certified by the Campaign Manager, Dr. Telasco. This point may 
also be corroborated by the abovementioned employee* Messrs. 
Mationg and Jimeno, in the office of the Qbezon Memorial Fund 
Drive. 

Charge No. XL 

Manager Velasco 1 s conduct in the case of Mr. P. V. Coni- 
conde, the designer of the Quezon Portrait, is also highly 
impdM>per. 

Mr. Coniconde, by vi*tue of a contract with the Quezon 
Memorial Committee, is entitled to a royalty of 10$ of the pro* 
ceeds of the sale of 100,000 copies of his portraits at Pl.00 
each. 

Due to financial pressure, he had been going to Dr. Velasco 1 s 
home asking him to speed up the lithographing of his portrait so 
that he might receive his royalty sonn* Dr. Velasco, in spite 
of the long time that had elapsed since the signing of the 
contract did not intentionally order the lithographing of said 
portrait. 

Taking advantage of Mr. Coniconde 1 s financial needs, he 
offered to eeJJL his royalty for Pl*OC0.00 to a friend (Dr. . 
Velasco 1 s). As Mr. Coniconde had already received from the 
Philippine National Bank, with the guaranty of the Chairman, 
a loan of P3* 700.00, including interest, he was 3till entitled 
to a balance of P6, 300.00, on the basis of 1*100,000.00 for 
100,000 copies of the portrait. Mr. Coniconde refused at first 
to sell his f*6, 300.00 royalty for the trifle sum of ^1,000.00* 
but Br. Velasco told him not to expect P6, 300.00, because out 
of this amount, the following were to be deducted; 30% for 
sales commission and 20$ for transportation expenses, depreeia- 
tian and administration. So, deducting 5055 from said balance of 

6,300.00 he was to receive only P3»150.0O, hs Ms*tciial**oyaity# 
and as he had already received P3>700. 00, he would be indebted to 
the Quezon Memorial Committee in the sum of F-550.00. 

This discouraged Mr. Coniconde and at last he agreed to 
sell his royalty for the paltry sum of P1,000.00. ft contract 
was drafted and Mr. Coniconde was asked to come back on the fol- 
lowing day to sign it and received the money from the supposed 
purchaser, (probably a dummy of Dr. Velasco). 

But fortunately for Mr. Coniconde, his sister, upon being 
informed of the proposed sale, told him that it was foolishness 
to sell his royalty for such a paltry sum. So, Mr. Coniconde 
backed out from the deal* 

Mr. Coniconde reported the matter to the Chairman of the 
Committee. This angered the Manager and in retaliation, to show 
him that he would get nothing more, he- succeeded in having the 
Committee pass a resolution providing (l) that from the proceeds 



of the sa le of the portrait* 30% must deducted as sales corals* 
si on and 20# for transportation expenses* The Committee approv- 
ed it without knowing that in the Coniconde contrast no provision 
was made as to sales commission and transportation expenses* This 
is violative of the terms of the contract. 

find the malice that inspires Dr* Velasco* s actuation in the 
Coniconde case is shown by the following glaring and undeniable 
facts*- 

1. There is no sales commission because all the propagan- 
da materials of the Committee are sold through the Directors of 
Bureaus, offices and government-owned companies in Manila and 
by the Provincial Governors* Provincial Treasurer*. Municipal 
Mayors and Municipal Treasurers in the provinces. Those agen- 
cies have already sold P8,600.00 worth of posters and £1,176*00 
worth of Christinas cards and no commission nor transportation 
charges were deducted from said amounts. The record of the 
National Treasurer bears out this statement. 

Now can transportation charges be deducted from the pro- 
ceeds of the sale of the portrait, when the Committee does not 
pay for such expenses, because the Committee has free passes 
for its fr&ight given, out of courtegy, by land, air and ship- 

Sing companies, like the PSL, CMJ, MRR Co** Luzon Bus Line, 
AL* Halili Transit, Rural Transit, Pantfrantio and others? 

The records of the National Treasurer do hot show any 
disbursement for transportation expenses from Manila to the 
provinces and even to Hawaii and California for the materials 
sent there were loaded in PfiL planes without charges. 

51 "iric 1 for %yw$$or*a"?3 ' ft • " ases* • !/ v. 

The only ' transportation expenses incurred for these 
laaterials are those small transportation charges from the * 
office to the stations of the transportation companies, 
which are insignificant in amount. 

Charge No» 15 

One of the evidences of poor management due to poor 
Judgment on the part of the Manager is that without authority 
from the Que2on Memorial Committee, he ordered the printing of 
what he calls Christmas Cards for sale at P3*00 a dozen. Thou- 
sands were sent to the Filipino Consuls at Hawaii and California, 
After 9 months, none of said eards have been sold # 

I request that this matter be looked intb by the NBI 
to determine how ouch the Committee lost in this queer ^ m ~ 
authorised venture. 

The greatest benefit given by those -cards was for Dr. 
Velasco for he ordered the printing of one hundred fifty cards 
with Ms name printed on which he sent to his friends with 
stamps of the Committee. 

t Samples of these cards with the 
may still be found in this office*

enclose herewith, for your information, a copy of the 
charges preferred by Representative lHateo K. Nonato 
against Dr. Pedro J. Velasco. 

The Quezon Memorial Committee, at its session 
held September 6 last, created a special sub-committee 
headed by Ex-Senator Hernaez, and the investigation has 
been set for September 28, 1§U8. 

One of the charges is for falsification of 
the daily tine record of hie daughter-in-law for havrlng 
certified that she reported to duty on the very day she 
delivered a child on January 17, 19*f8 and for several 
days thereafter, in order to enable her to receive her 
salary during that time. The daily time record and the 
birth certificate support this charge. Theee employees 
of the uuezon Memorial Office have signed affidavits. 
The case will be submitted to the City Fiscal* 

The Bureau of Investigation is now gathering 
evidence in support of the charges. 

It is not true that we have not given any 
cent to the Quezon Memorial Fund Drive, The checks 
not in possession of the : uezon Memorial Committee 
amount to *2, 500,00 and there is still money corning 
from the province of Tar lac. 

All the proceeds of our shows were checked 
by the respective Provincial Treasurers. 

I will send yon a copy of ny detailed re- 
port to the ^uezon Hemorial Committee regarding my 
activities in connection with the film "Meme Ka, Bun- 
so Ko." AS^F2>.

I am taking the liberty of sending you 
the papers herewith attached for your basis of in- 
formation pertinent, to the persecution and injus- 
tices to which I am being made the target, simply 
because I followed what I believe to be reasonable 
and just in compliance with my duty to rightfully 
protect and defend the interests of the Quezon Me- 
morial Committee, 

I believe that in a few days the inves- 
tigating sub-committee will soon render its deci- 
sion with full justice and fairness to all .parties 
concerned* 

Gleanings from said information shows 
that, this case is one of the few intrigues being 
engineered and fabricated by sinister hands, who 
by taking advantage of their power and influence, 
are exerting all their efforts to eliminate the 
Manager of the Quezon Memorial Committee for the 
purpose of satisfying their personal convenience, 
thereby affecting even minor employees whose lo- 
yalty to duties and services to the Quezon Memo- 
rial Committee are unquestioned*

ADI-IIN JSTEA.T IVE ORDER } 

) 

__ _) 

WHEREAS , under Resolution dated September 6, 1948, of 
the Quezon Memorial Committee, it was decided that the suspen- 
sion of Dr» Peiro J. Velasco, as Campaign Manager of the Quezon 
Memorial Committee decreed by the Chairman of the said Commit- 
tee be lifted immediately after the sub-committee on filing 
cabinet shall have certified that it had completed the segre- 
gation and inventory of the documents needed in the investiga- 
tion of the administrative case against the said Dr. Velasco; 

WHEREAS j the said sub-committee on filing cabinet has 
certified that it has completed its task of segregation and 
making the inventory of the documents mentioned in the next 
preceding paragraph; 

WHEREAS, a complaint was filed by Rep. Mateo M. Nonato 
against fir. Velasco in the Office of the City Fiscal of Manila 
for falsification of a public document in connection with the 
daily time record of Araceli Velasco Almeda daughter-in-law of 
Dr. Pedro J. Velasco; 

WHEREAS, the administrative investigation against Dr. 
Velasco as ordered by the Quezon Memorial Committee is still 
pending ; 

WHEREAS, Dr. Velasco filed in the Fiscal* s Office of 
Manila a complaint for trespass to dwelling against the em- 
ployees of the Quezon Memorial Committee, BBI Agent No. 49, 
Capt. V. Versoza, PC, and others who helped in transferring 
the office of the Quezon Memorial Committee from its former 
location at 643 Legarda, Manila, to the Department of the 
Interior at City Hall, Manila, upon order of the Chairman and 
the Committee; 

WHEREAS, the filing of said complaint for trespass, 
againdt precisely those employees of the Quezon Memorial 
Committee cited as witnesses against Dr. Velasco was prac- 
tically a threat to compel them not to testify against him 
in the administrative investigation and in fact it appears 
in the record of said investigation that said employees have 
either repudiated their previous sworn statements against Dr. 
Velasco or have actually dfcsisted from testifying against 
him fearing, of course, further reprisals; 

WHEREAS, the National Bureau of Investigation which 
was requested by the former Chairman of the Committee to ga- 
ther evidence in support of the charges preferred against 
Dr. Velasco by Rep. Mateo N. Nonato has not as yet completed^ 
its task due to the fact that Dr. Velasco ha s refused, as^j 

Of 



member pf t&e committee on filing cabinet, to continue segre- 
gating documents requested by the NBI on the ground that said 
sub-committee has already completed its work required Under 
Resolution of the Committee dated September 6, 1948 creating 
said sub-committee and that it cannot reopen anymore said fil- 
ing cabinet unless ordered by proper authority; 

WHEREAS, to reinstate now Dr. Velasco as Campaign Mana- 
ger would give him control of the documents of the Quezon Memo- 
rial Committee which are being used in the administrative and 
criminal cased against him and it would afford him opportunity 
to coerce or other-wise intimidate witnesses against him some 
of whom are employees of the Quezon Memorial Committee j 

WHEREAS, the records show undue interference by Dr. 
Velasco in the management of the Office even during the period 
of his suspension, said Dr. Velasco hating written to the Di- 
rector of Posts wherein he demanded delivery of official mails 
at his residence after the office has been ordered transferred 
therefrom and, it appearing also of record that Dr. Velasco 
during the said period of his suspension has been blocking, 
openly or surreptitiously, all appointments of the undersigned 
to important positions newly created in the current budget, 
under the pretext that he is still the Campaign Manager of the 
Quezon Memorial Drive, in defiance of the orders of the Chairman 
and of the Committee, to the embarrassment of the appointees 
who are former governors or representatives and thereby obs- 
tructing deliberately the normal functioning of the Office; 

NOV/, therefore, in the interest of the Quezon Memorial 
Committee and of a fair and impartial investigation of the ad- 
ministrative and criminal charges aforementioned against Dr. 
Pedro J. Velasco, his suspension is hereby continued until 
the investigations of the said charges are terminated.

I have the honor to invite your attention 
to the fact that the '8ub-comraitt.ee of three appoin- 
ted by the Quezon Memorial Committee to go over its

its letter to the Quezon Memorial Committee on No-

ty of furnishing you. 

Pursuant to thin, I have the honor to re- 
quest that the managership of said Quezon Memorial

the condition imposed and agreement arrived at by 
the Quezon Memorial Committee in session assembled 
on November 6, 1%#, and in accordance ;vith its Re- 
solution No. 212 of the satlG date# 

If the wishes of the governing body of the 
Quezon f-iemorial Fund are to have any value at all, 
and if the regulations set in resolution form, duly

force at all, and not become a force t.nd a tool of

you as Chairman, sir, see that the will of the go- 
verning body of this organization is carried out in 
spirit and to the letter? 

Trusting that you will see the fiirneos of

The Honorable 

The Sub-Committee on Investigation 

on the Charges against Dr. Velasco 
Quezon Memorial Committee 
Manila 



Gentlemen: 



+ . J J® Present this complaint in connection 
with the administrative case now pending before this 
Sub-Committee: 

^ ^ ^ , In disre gard of the powers of the Board 
and those of the Manager, the Honorable Chairman of the 
Quezon Memorial Committee made appointments to several 
positions which appointments, as per Resolution No. 36 
of the Committee should belong to the Manager, subiect 
to the approval of the Committee. Confusion is thus 
created* 

2. Without waiting for the report of this 
Sub-Committee, the Honorable Chairman issued administra- 
tive Order. No. a copy of which is hereto attached. 

continuing my suspension which is contrary to the reso- 
lution No. 212 which provided that my suspension would 
only last until the opening of my filing cabinet and the 
segregation of the papers that the attorney for the com- 
plainant needed, opening and segregation that have al- 
ready been made. 

# The grounds for the administrative order con- 

tinuing my suspension are not contemplated in the resolu- 
tion of the Board. They are: 

^ „ a * The administrative investigation conducted 

by this Honorable Sub-Committee; 

v ' b \ t The r^ plainti filed by Re P- M ateo M. Nonato 
at the Fiscal » s Office connected with the daily time 
report of Mrs. Araceli Velasco; 

c. The complaint that I have filed for tres- 
pass against some employees of the Quezon Memorial Com- 
mittee; and 

Of x 



- 2 - 



d» The investigation which the former Chair- 
man requested from the National Bureau of Investi- 
gation. 

The complaint before your Committee should not 
be the ground for continuing my suspension unless the 
Committee itself so recommends pending by the said 
Fiscal after investigation* 

My complaint filed in the Fiscal 1 s Office for 
trespass against several persons can not, under any 
rule or law or justice , be a ground for my suspension 
unless the intention is simply to cause me irreparable 
prejudice • 

The investigation of the National Bureau of In- 
vestigation should neither be a cause for my suspension 
because mere investigation does not imply my guilt* 

In order to avoid injustices and for the sake 
of the Quezon Memorial Committee, which should func- 
tion smoothly without conflict of authority, it is 
respectfully requested that the Sub-Committee recom- 
mend to the Quezon Memorial Committee immediate ac- 
tion on the above matters. 



Very respectfully,

Manila, November 25, 1943 



Hon* Sotero Baluyot 
Chairman 

Quezon Memorial Committee 
Manila 



Sirs 

I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter 
of November 13, 194#i enclosing a copy of your Administrative 
Order dated November 17, 1943, erdering continuation of my 
suspension until the investigation of certain charges there- 
in mentioned is terminated* In your letter I am directed 
to deliver to Atty. Jose M* Manalo as Acting Campaign Mana- 
ger the key to the filing cabinet of the Quezon Memorial Com- 
mittee and all the records, documents, materials and other 
properties of the committee including the Quezon Funeral 
Film* 

In this connection, I beg to invite your attention to 
the fact that by Resolution No. 212 of the Quezon Memorial 
Committee I am entitled to be reinstated immediately after 
the sub-committee created for the purpose of opening my 
filing cabinet has completed its work* The said sub-com- 
mittee having already reported the completion of its task 
as per your very Administrative Order, I feel that I am 
entitled to reinstatement and I respectfully urge that I 
be recognized as reinstated effective as of the date of the 
Filing Cabinet Committee f s report* 

And with reference to the ground on which you have or- 
dered the continuation of my suspension, I beg to states 

1* As to the opening of my filing cabinet under your 
very Administrative Order, my suspension should be lifted 
immediately after the sub-committee on filing cabinet shall 
have certified that it has completed its work, and under 
paragraph 2 of your said Administrative Order, said sub- 
committee has already certified the completion of its task* 

2* With regards to the second ground of your Adminis- 
trative Order, namely that Representative Nonato has filed 
in the City Fiscal *s Office charges for falsification against 
me in connection with the daily time record of Mrs* Araceli 
Velasco Almeda, I beg to inform you that the City Fiscal, 
after investigation, dropped the dharges as unfounded* 

3* The third ground mentioned in your administrative 
Order - the administrative investigation against me, I wish 
to present to you the fact that the sub-committee appointed 
for the purpose has already finished investigation and while 
it has not yet rendered its decision* 5 it has not recommended 
the modification of the conditions of my suspension* Conse- 
quently, the lifting of my suspension should have been im- 
mediately recognized after the sub-committee on filing cabi- 
net had submitted its report* 

4* Your Administrative Order also is based on the fact 
that I have filed complaints for trespass against some emplo- 
yees of the Quezon Memorial Committee and its agents* In 
this connection, I wish to call your attention that under no 
principle of law or justice should a complainant be suspended 
pending the investigation of his complaint* 




I 

i 



- 2 



5* The Administrative Order also states for ground 
of my suspension, the fact that the National Bureau of In- 
vestigation was requested by the former Chairman of the 
Committee to "gather evidence in support of the charges 
against me by Representative Mateo N* Nonato* On the one 
hand, it is an injustice on the part of anybody that an 
investigation be ordered precisely n to gather evidence in 
support of charges" instead of an investigation to deter- 
mine the truth of the charges* Such an investigation 
fl togather evidence in support of charges 11 is naturally 
partial and one-sided* On the other hand, the fact that 
investigations are being conducted by the National Bureau 
of Investigation has never been the ground for any such 
a drastic action as suspension* Recently we have witnessed 
cases of government officials being investigated by the 
NBI without any suspension* 

6* There is also a statement in your Administrative 
Order that my reinstatement would give me control of the 
documents and influence over witnesses, which parts from 
the hypothesis that I would violate ray duties if reinstated, 
when the presumption of law is that a public official and 
everybody is honest* 

7* The other statements contained in your Administrative 
Order show that you have simply condemned me without previous 
hearing and assumed that I have no right to the office of 
Manager* Appointments have been made by your Honor which, 
by standing resolutions of the Quezon Memorial Committee 
belong to the manager with the approval of the Board* Such 
appointments, I submit, are therefore, illegal and only 
create confusion and conflict in the Quezon Memorial Com- 
mittee is offices* 

Finally, I wish to invite your attention to the fact 
that I was not appointed by the Chairman, that I owe my 
appointment as Manager to Resolution No* 107 of the Que- 
zon Memorial Committee and consequently it is only the 
Board that has the right to suspend me from office* 

Trusting that you will see the justice of this letter 
and of my insistence that instead of turning over the office 
and all its belongings to the Actirjg Manager appointed by 
you, it is he who should be ordered to turn over whatever 
properties came into his possession belonging to the said 
institution, and with the request, that your Administrative 
Order be given no effect and that the Acting Manager be ins- 
tructed to turn over the office and its belongings to me, 
I am yours 



Very respectfully,

Mrs. Aurora Quezon is deserving of all ap- 
preciation and respect for the efforts she is exert- 
ing to maintain inexhaustible the resources and pos- 
sibilities of the Philippine Red Cross. Her self- 
denial in the performance of her duties in this bene- 
ficent mission evidently constitutes a magnetic force 
that is attracting the moral sense of persons of good 
will, either for the effect of autosuggestion which 
inspires in them with desires and civic spirit to de- 
dicate themselves to noble and humanitarian tasks 
that the people need. But the most admirable in the 
distinguished widow of President Quezon is the fact 
that in her heart benevolence that has saturated her 
spirit towards her fellow-beings is inexhaustible, 
guided by the same idiosyncracy that she acquired from 
her deceased husband. 

What would be the feeling of the distinguished 
widow if she were informed of the great interest or the 
indifference of the people in a province, city or town in 
the campaign for the Quezon Memorial Foundation ; when 
Dfia. Aurora, for the welfare of the people whom her 
late hus band served until the hour of his death , is 
constantly entertaining the affection of a most lov- 
ing mother, planning day and night what she must do 
to comply with her duties towards those who may need 
assistance in the bitter hours of misfortune, or to 
remedy in some manner the deficiencies in the services 
of social welfare, that the people need daily to main- 
tain even if only a bearable standard of life of the 
unfortunate! 

While on the other hand, what would be the 
moral satisfaction felt by the generous widow of the 
III* ? S i dent Q ? ezon wh en she thinks that the proposed 
Spon???/^^^"^ 0 ^ of her husband will be in 
?S JiS V 1 ™ JPWTIOT that will aid the government

for the vital existence of a nation like ours.

1 irmTS! S i°o S of thG Executive Committee of the Phi- 
lippine Red Cross under the chairmanship of Mrs. Que- 
f™' ®° ™ at all provincial and municipal Sub-Commit- 
™J+t S 2? act ^ the same manner and in accordance 
wixn Chart No. h and Graphic No. 5 following the des- 
criptions of Appendix "A" so that all activities may 
De well coordinated and systematized in the interest 
of the Quezon Memorial Fund Drive? 

In these moments very few would realize the 
purely constructive effects for the government and for 
the people in general of the original services that 
will be rendered by the future QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDA - 
TION thru a technically planned organization under the 
control of a Board of Trustees. 

When the realization of the Rizal Memorial 
Coliseum was but a dream, nobody imagined that some- 
day it may have so great a national importance much 
less as a positive factor for the physical culture of 
our students under the national point of view, but now 

that the COLISEUM is actively operating, we ask: did 
not our athletes give world renown to the Philippines 
in the international tournaments where they took part, 
bringing to the Philippines the LAURELS of their cham- 
pionship? - thanks to the genius and decision of the 
late President Quezon who did not spare any effort to 
erect the Jose Rizal Memorial Stadium to realize in 
tangible deeds the ideals of Jose Rizal who said: 
" Filipino vouth. beautiful hope of the fatherland" . 

If now we palpably see the glorious success 
C f the Rizal Memorial Coliseum , we will witness other 
glories and colossal surprises in regard to the social 
welfare and aducational services that will be rendered 
fo the people by the Q UEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION. 

Therefore, your maximum effort is requested 
in cooperating in all the activities being undertaken 
for the QUEZON MEMORIAL FUND DRIVE. 



Sincere!

My dear 

The estimated minimum quota of your province for 
the Quezon Memorial Fund is f , of which you were 

duly notified by us at the beginning of this campaign. 

In order to carry out with efficiency and coordi- 
nated action the provincial and municipal campaign, your 
activities must be systematized and for this purpose you 
are requested to provide for the execution of the plans 
laid out in Chart No. 4 in all the Municipalities, divid- 
ing each locality into Sections or Districts and that eve- 
ry Sub-Committee should take charge of each Section or 
District. 

Disregarding the specific nature of the sub-com- 
mittee to which members are assigned according to Chart No. 
4, and to secure the greatest profit from their plausible 
services, they may however, receive the contribution of 
any person residing within the Section assigned to each. 

A day of the week should be fixed for all the sub- 
committee or their members to go from house to house to ask 
for voluntary contributions, and to sell our campaign sou- 
venirs, and this work may be extended to the barrios; each 
councilor or the barrio lieutenant, or a well known resi- 
dent to be in charge of his District. It is necessary that 
an executive central organization be established to be in 
continuous action in checking up the activities. It is for 
this purpose that the Provincial Sub-Committee presided over 
by the Governor and City or Municipal Sub-Committee with the 
Mayor as Chairman, have been created. 

It is requested that a list of all the members. of 
each Sub-Committee organized in conformity with Chart No. 
4 be sent to us immediately so that we may be informed of 




the assignment of each one and the EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 
may in due time send them expressions of its grateful 
acknowledgment. 

Taking advantage of the great help of the Sub- 
Committee, the leaders should be encouraged to organize 
their respective Benefit Programs fixing dates in ad- 
vance and avoiding that they should coincide with one 
another in order that all may cooperate simultaneously 
on the date set for the event by each Committee, for only 
in this way it will be a success* 

According to the rule, 20% of the gross proceeds 
of any Benefit may be appropriated for promotions and orga- 
nization expenses to cover even part of the essential ex- 
penses, thus avoiding the organizers from spending too 
much of their money, without prejudice to exerting every 
effort to give the Quezon Memorial Fund a considerable in- 
come from each affair. The Municipal Treasurer and the 
Auditor must be advised in advance of these shows so that 
they may check up the tickets. The share of the Quezon 
Memorial Fund must be turned over to the Treasurer. 

• 

Herewith is enclosed a sample BLUEPRINT of the 
Topographic View of a town as (CHART NO. 5) showing its 
division into Sections, each of which shall be placed 
under a Sub-Committee, as it appears in the attached 
(Appendix B A n ). 

Please answer this letter as soon as possible 
with such suggestions as you may deem advisable. 



Sincerely yours, 

DR. PEDRO J.JTELASCO 
Campaign Manager 
Quezon Memorial Committee 




LET US HAVE A QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION 




President Quezon at a meeting of the Pacific powers presided by Roosevelt and 
attended by Churchill, Canada's Premier King, and Spokesmen of China, Australia 

and New Zealand. (1943) 



The crowning glory of his career was when he signed the Declaration of the United Nations 
on June 14, 1942, in the name of the Philippines, winning the world's recognition of the Philippines 
as a nation. Later, the Philippines also became an equal participant in the Pacific War Council. 

Just a few days before the American forces landed in Leyte to begin the battle of liberation 
of the Philippines, Manuel L. Quezon passed to the Great Beyond. 

President Sergio Osmena said of him on August 3, 1944, over the NBC hoolc-up: "The Story 
of Manuel L. Quezon's life is the story of a people who love* freedom and are ready to sacrifice for 
it. He is not really dead. He lives in the hearts of 18,000,000 Filipinos, and in that of every man who 
loves freedom." 




i 



-THE PHILIPPINES OF TOMORROW WILL BE A COUNTRY 
OF PLENTY, OF HAPPINESS AND OF FREEDOM. IT WILL BE A 
PHILIPPINES WITH HER HEAD RAISED IN THE MIDST OF THE 
WEST PACIFIC." 

This is one of President Quezon's messages to his people : "There is 
one thought which I want you always to have in mind, and that is: that 
you are Filipinos, that the Philippines is your country and the only coun- 
try God has given you; that you must keep it for yourselves, for your 
children, and for your children's children until the world is no more; and 
that you must live for it and die for it, if necessary. 

"Your country is a great country. It has a great past, a great pre- 
sent and a great future. 

"The Philippines of yesterday was consecrated by the sacrifices of 
lives and treasures of your patriots, martyrs and soldiers. 

"The Philippines of today is honored by the whole-hearted devotion 
to its cause ot unselfish and courageous statesmen. 

"The Philippines of tomorrow will be a country of plenty, of hap-

—THE SITE OF THE MONUMENT— 

It will be in a prominent site in Quezon City. The place will be converted into a truly ideal 
park, surrounded by the wonders of nature, which will attract the continuous pilgrimage of tourists, 
specially the students. When we say "wonders of nature" it is because there will be surprises in the 
global interpretation between practical life and art, science and culture of the Philippines, virtues which 
will constitute part of the treasures of the monument. In that park the splendors of the city will 
blend with the panoramas of nature in a rural and wild atmosphere; the vcrdour of the park- will be a 
pleasure to the eyes and will enhance the health of its inhabitants, visitors and daily guests; there in 
the midst of an enchanting scenery, the rose and the orchid will strive for supremacy in glamour, 
beauty and loveliness — no doubt the landscape experts will lay it out with such perfection as will make 
of it a real botanical garden, pleasant, beautiful and ideal. 

—THE LIBRARY— 

There is no doubt that it will have a good Quezonian Library of international character. The library 
will be for public use specially the scholars and the students. There are good probabilities that this 
library will contain valuable materials on the level of progress in its real sense. 

-THE MUSEUM — 

Perhaps one of the best attractions of the Quezon Memorial will be a museum containing rare and 
historical objects to admire, relics of diverse physical expressions with their ethnological characters, 
some of which will be archeological rarities, historical amulets of natives and aborigines, rare ob- 
jects of anthropology, etc. The last war has created a very wide field where abound materials for mu- 
seum collections; beside the specific objects and personal appurtenances that have direct or indirect con- 
nection with the private and public life of President Quezon. 

—THE QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION— 

The feeling of humanity and affection towards the unfortunate is innate in al- 
truistic peoples who move with the course of civilization, and an. Independent Phil- 
ippines must not only preserve its patrimony as a Christian people, but strengthen 
it, by improving its beneficent facilities, so that without resorting to means of doubt- 
fur decency, they may comfortably shoulder their duties in maintaining a good service 
for social welfare. 

The Foundation will no doubt be the soul and living spirit of the Quezon Monu- 
ment. It is proposed to establish an "Organized Beneficence," from which the Gov- 
ernment itself will derive much benefit. It will be under the control of a board 
of trustees. 

In almost the majority of progressive countries of advanced culture and civilization 
exist institutions of social welfare and security, specially in the United States of America 
where there are not less than fifty kinds of the biggest and the best FOUNDATIONS 
which are engaged in different activities on Beneficence, Sociology, Education, Sciences, 
Eleemosnary, Physical Culture; Medical, Agricultural and Industrial Research, Inter- 
national Peace, Principles of Democracy, Racial Questions, Labor Problems, Public 
Health, Scholarship, Religion, etc. 

— * The abundance in the United States of America, unlike other countries, of its Foundations, has posi- 
tively influenced in the formation of the National Character of the most powerful country in the world, for 
its Altruism, Democracy and Humanitarian sense. 

While the Axis countries and their allies have branded humanity as idiotism liable 
to degenerate afterwards with the instinct of destruction of the human species and 

Christianity President Quezon, on the other hand, proclaimed that "Democracy is a 

farce without Social Justice", and strove to outline a policy that produced tangible 
results for the people, particularly to the working masses. 

An accredited institution like the "Quezon Memorial Foundation" would be an 
ideal organization to take charge of an "Organized Beneficence" to supplement the 
Government in the services that it has to render to the public, in this line, whidi is 
most indispensable for the social welfare. The Government as well as the Red Cross 



8 



' and other similar organizations would welcome the creation of another national ins- 
titution intended to help cope with the necessary work of relief that they are required 
to render to the needy. 

The lack of centralization in this line gives way to many sorts of deceits, . mis- 
appropriations of funds and property, yet the' services rendered are almost imperceptible, 
although they are good enough as a means of emotional appeal for financial support. 

Jhor this reason, it is deemed proper to establish a new institution to centralize 
certain services, which only give chances to unnecessary overlapping that spoils the good 
will of the few philanthropists in the Philippines; but when we say few, we do not mean 
that many of the privileged class are indifferent towards this Christian duty; on the 
contrary, everybody knows that the sentiment of Christianity is common among the 
Filipinos but on the other hand no organization solidly established with popular support 
has had the courage to take the initiative of shouldering this mission, to stimulate those 
who are altruists and philanthropists, capable of cooperating disinterestedly with full 
devotion and for this purpose, it is planned to create the "Quezon Memorial Founda- 
tion" which will be the ideal institution to perform this great service of social justice 
within certain limits, under proper regulation. 

—A GALLERY OF FILIPINO HEROES AND MARTYRS— 

This hallowed hall will be a part of the museum and will undoubtedly attract the admiration of 
cosmopolitan people; who knows! It will be a. solemn hall containing the historical figures in 
natural size (made of wax) of the Filipino heroes and martyrs who strove for justice and liberty for the 
Philippines, from Lapu-lapu, Soliman, Burgos, Bonifacio, Rizal, Mabini, Marcelo del Pilar, Luna, Gregorio 
del Pilar, to President Quezon with the other heroes of Bataan and Corregidor. 

The hall will be decorated with fine engravings of different anthropological groups of the Philip- 
pine race. 

Beautiful sarcophagi representing, symbolic figures and emblems of heroism in an array of art will 
give pre-eminenc« to the whole in full harmony with the solemnity of the hall of the "Quezon Foun- 
dation". , 

—SEEDS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE— 

Appeal must be made to public opinion that the Quezon Memorial Fund Drive 
must not be affected by party differences although we are the first to respect the prin- 
ciples and political reactions of every one, inasmuch as all have the right to freedom of 
action within our democratic set-up; we wish, however, to remind everybody that this 
noble undertaking is purely of a civic nature, its main purpose being to show the popular 
recognition and gratitude to the late President Quezon for his patriotic labors and that 
the monument to be erected in his honor will be an institution intended to promote 
national culture and works of beneficence as reminiscent of his social justice pro- 
gram to the end that those in need of relief or some help that will open to them some 
opportunity for betterment, may feel the beneficial effects of the institution. Quezon 
sowed the seeds of social justice, and so the Committee is desirous of seeing to it that the 
erection of the monument will give birth to a FOUNDATION that will continue ren- 
dering services to the people. 

It is understood that the Committee will do its best to have the FOUNDATION 
render the services mentioned, provided the goal set for in this drive will be fully covered 
to defray the cost of construction of this huge project. 

All of us, therefore, must give our contributions and ask others to help also in 
the realization of this work of national importance.

1898 under General Emilio Aguinaldo, he

one of the last to surrender to American

"FREEDOM OF THOUGHT, OF SPEECH AND FREEDOM OF 
ACTION ARE THE MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSIONS OF A FREE 
MAN." 

Filipino unity as the first and foremost consideration in the con- 
struction of our national edifice, had always been advocated by President 
Quezon "as his lifelong service to his country. For his idea of unity he 
said, "when I speak of unity, I do not mean that we must all think alike 
or that all must accept as gospel truth the opinions and ideas of the 
leader of the nation, or that everyone must blindly follow his advice. 
Freedom of thought, of speech and freedom of action are the most pre- 
cious possessions of a free man." 

He fought sectionalism as a political cancer. Even when he had al- 
ready attained the highest office in the gift of the people, when with his 
power he could do anything that he wanted, he strove for the unity of 
the people in matters of general and national concern. And he succeeded 
in this to a high degree. It is undisputable that there is a strong Philip- 
pine nationalism based on the unity of people. 

Let us then unite in giving our share to the construction of the Que- 
zon Memorial. It will be anoth?r symbol of Filipino unity. 

"When I speak of unity, I do not mean that we must all think alike 
or that all must accept as gospel truth the opinions and ideas of the 
leader of the nation, or that everyone must blindly folloiu his advice.

possessions of a free man."

As the leader of 18,000,000 Filipinos, he showed sincere concern for the welfare 
of the masses. He established Quezon City principally for government laborers and 
employees, bought big haciendas and parcelled them to tenants at cost, rewarded 
enlightened capitalists, evolved other socjal justice programs.

RECIPROCAL CONSIDERATION TOWARD ONE ANOTHER 



President Quezon succeeded in putting into effect his plans of Social 
Justice in his administration through legislation and personal campaigns. 
He improved the relations between capital and labor, between land owners 
and tenants and between employers and employees and he emphasized 
that these relations should be based upon reciprocal consideration of 
one toward the other. He trained his administration towards definite 
and specific goals calculated to establish suoh economic relations be- 
tween individuals and groups as are based upon mutual regard and con- 
sideration of each other's interest, reciprocity and mutual human con- 
sideration. 

He caused the passage of legislation authorizing the purchase of big 
landed estates to be sold to the tenants, he established colonies in fertile 
virgin lands in Mindanao and Northern Luzon so that laborers in con- 
gested regions might emigrate to such places and colonize them; in the 
City of Manila he caused the construction of tenement buildings for 
laborers to eliminate the city slums; he fixed a high standard of wage 
of Government laborers so that private interprises might adopt such rate 
of wages; the labor legislation passed by the Legislature to improve the 
living conditions of laborers is due to his interest in the welfare of the 
masses.

ACKNOWLEDGED LEADER OF A RACE THAT HAS RAISED 
HIM TO DOMINANCE FOR THE LAST TWO DECADES. 

In the words of General Mac Arthur, "Manuel L. Quezon is 
the President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. He has been 
twice exalted to that eminent position by the peaceful suffrage of the 
Filipino people. When he speaks, however, he does not do so merely 
as the official representative of his country. He speaks as the acknowl- 
edged leader of a race that has raised him to dominance for the last two 
decades." 

If we could get what we needed from America during the days of 
President Quezon, it was not because America could so easily grant US 

what we asked, but to a large measure because of America's esteem 
to our chosen leader. His presentation of our cause was so lucid and 

real that the Americans could not help but give us what we really needed. 

One of the greatest political achievements of the late President was 
his success in securing the passage of the Tydings-McDuff ie Law under 
which Philippine Independence was finally attained on July 4, 1946. 
When he arrived in America, a hostile Congress was pitted against 
him. Yet, with his eloquence and virtue of persuasion and with the 
support of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he came back to the Philippines 
with the TydingB-McDuffie Law in his portfolio. 

Let us not allow the name of our beloved leader to be lost in obliv- 
ion. Let us remember the man who placed his country above self by 
contributing our share to the Quezon Memorial Fund. 

When he speaks, he does not do so merely as the official repre- 
sentative of his country.. . He speaks as the acknowledged leader of a 
race that has raised him to dominance for the last two decades.

A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECTS, FEATURES AND SERVICES OF WHICH 
THE PROPOSED MONUMENT OR QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION SHALL CONSIST 

—THE STATUE OF PRESIDENT QUEZON— 

Efforts will be made to make his statue the natural expression of his dynamic character with 
certain reflections on Social Justice. (The engineers and artists will take care to reproduce these de- 
tails through the most brilliant execution of art, to form a combination of beauties, concentrated in a 
colossal symbol of patriotism and humanity.) 

—THE MAUSOLEUM OF PRESIDENT QUEZON— 

Perhaps the mausoleum will be a happy combination of art in an -allegorical design, which will 
show a particular feature of the architectures of the nations in the course of their epochs and centu- 
ries—with the use of prime materials of the Philippines. (The architects and artists will have the 
final say.)

—THE SITE OF THE MONUMENT — 
It will be in a prominent site in Quezon City. The place will be converted into a truly ideal 
park, surrounded by the wonders of nature, which will attract the continuous pilgrimage ^f tourists, 
specially the students. When we say "wonders of nature" it is because there will be surprises in the 
global interpretation between practical life and art, science and culture of the Philippines, virtues which 
will constitute part of the treasures of the monument. In that park the splendors of the city will 
blend with the panoramas of nature in a rural and wild atmosphere; the verdour of the park will be a 
pleasure to the eyes and will enhance the health of its inhabitants, visitors and daily guests; there in 
the midst of an enchanting scenery, the rose and the orchid will strive for supremacy in glamour, 
beauty and loveliness— no doubt the landscape experts will lay it out with such perfection as will make 
of it a real botanical garden, pleasant, beautiful and ideal. 

—THE LIBRARY—- 

There is no doubt that it will have a good Quezonian Library of international character. The library g 

will I* for public use specially the scholars and rhe midtna There arc good probabilities that this j- 

library will contain valuable materials on the level of progress in its real sense. uj 

— THE MUSEUM— O 

Perhaps one of the best attractions of the Quezon Memorial will be a museum containing rare and 

historical objects to admire, relics of diverse physical expressions with their ethnological characters, ^ 

some of which will be archeological rarities, historical amulets of natives and aborigines, rare ob- q 

jects of anthropology, etc. The last war has created a very wide field where abound materials for mu- >- 

scum collections; beside the specific objects , and personal appurtenances that have direct or indirect con- ^ 

nection with the private and public life of President Quezon. O 

—THE QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION— g 

The feeling of humanity and affection towards the unfortunate is innate in al- X 

truistic peoples , who move with the course of civilization, and an Independent Phil- 2 

ippines must not only preserve its patrimony as a Christian people, but strengthen o_ 

it, by improving its beneficent facilities, so that without resorting to means of doubt- uj 

ful decency, they may comfortably shoulder their duties in maintaining a good service ^ 

for social welfare. ^ 

The Foundation will no doubt be the soul and living spirit of the Quezon Monu- o 

ment. It is proposed to establish an "Organized Beneficence," from which the Gov- ^ 

eminent itself will derive much benefit. It will be under the control of a board " 

of trustees. S 

In almost the majority of progressive countries of advanced culture and civilization 5? 

exist institutions of social welfare and security, specially in the United States of America q 

where there are not less than fifty kinds of the biggest and the best FOUNDATIONS O 

which are engaged in different activities on Beneficence, Sociology, Education, Sciences, < 

Eleemosnary, Physical Culture; Medical, Agricultural and Industrial Research, Inter- £ 

national Peace, Principles of Democracy, Racial Questions, Labor Problems, Public 5 

Health, Scholarship, Religion, etc. <> 

77 JC abundance in the United States of America, unlike other countries, of its Foundations, has posi- 
tively influenced in the formation of the National Character of the most powerful country in the world, for 
its Altruism, Democracy and Humanitarian sense. 

While the Axis countries and their allies have branded humanity as idiotism liable 
to degenerate afterwards with the instinct of destruction of the human species and 
Christianity— President Quezon, on the other hand, proclaimed that "Democracy is a 
farce without Social Justice", and strove to outline a policy that produced tangible 
results for the people, particularly to the working masses. 

An accredited institution like the "Quezon Memorial Foundation" would be an 
ideal organization to take charge of an "Organized Beneficence" to supplement the 
Government in the services that it has to render to the public, in this line, which is 

15 



most indispensable for the social welfare. The Government as well as the Red Cross 
and other similar organizations would welcome the creation of another national ins- 
titution intended to help cope with the necessary work of relief that they are required 
to render to the needy. 

The lack of centralization in this line gives way to many sorts of deceits, mis- 
appropriations of funds and property, yet the services rendered are almost imperceptible, 
although they are good enough as a means of emotional appeal for financial support. 

For this reason, it is deemed proper to establish a new institution to centralize 
certain services, which only give chances to unnecessary overlapping that spoils the good 
will of the few philanthropists in the Philippines; but when we say few, we do not mean 
that many of the privileged class are indifferent towards this Christian duty; on the 
contrary, everybody knows that the sentiment of Christianity is common among the 
Filipinos but on the other hand no organization solidly established with popular support 
has had the courage to take the initiative of shouldering this mission, to stimulate those 
who are altruists and philanthropists, capable of cooperating disinterestedly with full 
devotion and for this purpose, it is planned to create the "Quezon Memorial Founda- 
tion" which will be the ideal institution to perform this great service of social justice 
within certain limits, under proper regulation. 

—A GALLERY OF FILIPINO HEROES AND MARTYRS — 

This hallowed hall will be a part of the museum and will undoubtedly attract the admiration of 
cosmopolitan people; who knows! It will be a solemn hall containing the historical figures in 
natural size (made of wax) of the Filipino heroes and martyrs who strove for justice and liberty for the 
Philippines, from Lapu-lapu, Soliman, Burgos, Bonifacio, Rizal, Mabini, Marcclo del Pilar, Luna, Gregorio 
del Pilar, to President Quezon with the other heroes of Bataan and Corregidor. 

The hall will be decorated with fine engravings of different anthropological groups of the Philip- 
pine race. 

Beautiful sarcophagi representing symbolic figures and emblems of heroism in an array of art will 
give pre-eminence CO the whole in full harmony with the solemnity of the hall of the "Quezon Foun- 
dation". 

—SEEDS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE— 

Appeal must be made to public opinion that the Quezon Memorial Fund Drive 
must not be affected by party differences although we are the first to respect the prin- 
ciples and political reactions of every one, inasmuch as all have the right to freedom of 
action within our democratic set-up; we wish, however, to remind everybody that this 
noble undertaking is purely of a civic nature, its main purpose being to show the popular 
recognition and gratitude to the late President Quezon for his patriotic labors and that 
the monument to be erected in his honor will be an institution intended to promote 
national culture and works of beneficence as reminiscent of his social justice pro- 
gram to the end that those in need of relief or some help that will open to them some 
opportunity for betterment, may feel the beneficial effects of the institution. Quezon 
sowed the seeds of social justice, and so the Committee is desirous of seeing to it that the 
erection of the monument will give birth to a FOUNDATION that will continue ren- 
dering services to the people. 

It is understood that the Committee will do its best to have the FOUNDATION 
render the services mentioned, provided the goal set for in this drive will be fully covered 
to defray the cost of construction of this huge project. 

All of us, therefore, must give our contributions and ask others to help also in 
the realization of this work of national importance. 

Colkct the pamphlets from I to XUL Read them and yon will find on the top of the first pages 
some interesting words. Place them in correlative order and you will discover something of interest.

President Quezon not only preached social justice as Chief of State; as a land- 
lord he gave a practical example by increasing the share of the tenants. The above 
picture, taken in a moment of relaxation in his Arayat plantation, shows him distribut

PRESIDENT QUEZON HAD THE WELFARE OF THE LABOR 
POPULATION AT HEART — IT WAS HIS FERVENT DESIRE TO 
HAVE HEALTHY, EFFICIENT AND HAPPY LABORERS 

The late President Manuel L. Quezon was the patron of the labor- 
ers. To him, they were foremost in his heart. It was always his wish- 
es "to pay good wages to our laborers, to give them proper nourishment, 
proper nutrition which means health. A healthy laborer can do more 
and better work than one who is sickly and underfed/' 

Through his career as a public servant to his country, primarily as 
a legislator and as chief executive, President Quezon had always taken 
particular interest in improving the lot and welfare of the laboring 
class. The masses loved him to the same extent that he loved them. 
If the late President had our welfare at heart, it is but proper that we 
show our profound gratitude to him by supporting the movement to erect 
a monument in his honor. 

The postulate of Social Justice inserted in our Constitution has 
been inspired by the late President. And in his life-time he was able 
to translate such Social Justice into reality. 

Let us contribute to the Quezon Memorial fund. We feel sure 
that the labor population will gladly give their corresponding share to 
this worthy cause. 

Let us make the movement a success. Its success is the common 
success of all. 

"To pay good wages to our laborers, to give them proper nourish- 
ment, proper mutrition tvhich means health."

There is no better tribute to the memory of the 
late President than the establishment of a Memorial 
Foundation with the grains of sand donated by the 
people, a living institution of beneficence and culture-

was the main concern of his life.

WE SHOULD NOT BE A SLAVISH IMITATOR OF OTHER 
COUNTRIES 

Like Dr. Rizal, President Quezon during his life time worked hard, 
enhanced the progress of his people along cultural lines, in education, 
in civic virtues, in the development of a national language of their own. 
He said, "it is far better that a nation should evolve its own type of 
culture and of government and should follow its own instincts in se- 
lecting a path toward the attainment of a higher civilization than that 
it should be made a slavish imitator of any: other country or group of 
countries however elevated may be the civilization of the latter." 

For the purpose of developing a National Language, the National 
Language Institute was created and is until n6w functioning and achiev- 
ing considerable progress in the realization of the purposes for which 
it was created under the leadership of the late President. 

The Quezon Memorial will be a testimonial of the people's grati- 
tude to the man who helped raise their standard of culture and as the 
Quezon Memorial will be a memorial for Filipino culture, it merits your 
help and support. 

" . . . .it is far better that a nation should evolve its own type of 
culture and of government and should folloio its own instincts in selecting 
a path toward the attainment of a higher civilization."

FOUNDATIONS AND THEIR SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE 



"THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION" 

The United States has a number of foundations established primarily to promote the welfare of 
humanity in all lines of human endeavor. The Rockefeller Foundation, a philanthropic trust, was incor- 
porated by Act of the N. Y. Legislature of May 14, 1913. By the terms of the Act, the trustees were 
constituted a body corporate with power to receive and manage funds for the purpose of "promoting 
the well-being of mankind throughout the world," through charitable, religious, missionary and educa- 
tional activities as well as through research and publication. The Foundation received gifts aggregating 
$100,000,000 from John D. Rockefeller and $48,000 in trust for specific purposes from Mrs. John D. 
Rockefeller. The management of the Foundation is practically unrestricted in respect to the business 
activities it may undertake in the interest of the Foundation. 

The activities upon which the Foundation has entered cover a wide range of affairs. Among the 
most important was the organization of a world-wide campaign against the hookworm disease; the 
establishment of the China Medical Commission for the promotion of public health and medical 
education in China; the creation of an Industiial Relations Investigation Division for conducting a 
itudy of the relations of capital and labor; the foundation of a "War Relief Commissjpn to cooperate 
with the Commission for Relief in Belgium; work in cooperation with the Red Cross Society to check 
the ravages of typhus in Serbia. 

THE LAURA SPELMAN ROCKEFELLER MEMORIAL FOUNDATION 

In 1929 the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Fund of $2,500,000 was combined with the 
Rockefeller Foundation. The plan of work adopted provided for cooperation toward the advancement 
of knowledge in the fields of public health, the medical sciences, the natural sciences (taking over the 
foreign program of the International Educational Board), "the social sciences (formerly the province of 
the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial), and the humanities. For the administration of the program 
in public health, an international health division was created. 

The International Health Division assists in projects for improving public health, not only in tho 
U. S. but also in foreign countries. This aid includes participation in studies of yellow fever, malaria, 
hookworm disease, tuberculosis and respiratory diseases; in campaigns for the reduction of malaria

THE CARNEGIE^ FOUNDATION 

Carnegie Foundation tor the advancement of teaching (N. Y.) — This was founded originally 
in 1905 to provide pensions for teachers in the form of free gifts. The system was at first non- 
contributory, but after elaborate investigation, a new system was adopted by which colleges and 
teachers both contribute on a properly calculated actuarial basis. The Foundation has under- 
taken inquiries in the field of education, and issued reports. Its capital and reserves amount to 
nearly $50,000,000. 

THE JOHN SIMON GUGGENHEIM MEMORIAL FOUNDATION

the Russell 'Sa?c Foundation to improve the social and living conditions of the U. S., 1907; over 
$3,500,000 to educational purposes, and $300,000 for the Sage Institute of Pathology. She died Nov. 
4, 1918, and by her will over $50,000,000 was distributed to charities, hospitals, and ' educational 
institutions. 

THE MELLON FOUNDATION 

Mellon, Andrew William, an American financier and public official, donated to the U. S. Gov- 
ernment his collection of paintings by old masters, valued at $19,000,000, and the sum of $8,000,000 
for the erection of a National Gallery of Art. There are about seventy paintings in the collection. 
Among Mr. Mcllon's stipulations were the following: that additions to the collection shall meet a high 
standard; that the building in which they are housed, to be designed by John Russel Pope, shall be 
erected on the mall near the Smithsonian Institution; that it shall not bear the Mellon name; that the 
Smithsonian Institution shall supervise the project; and that Congress shall provide for the upkeep of 
the building. For one of the pictures in the collection, Raphael's Madonna of the House of Alba, 
Mr. Mellon paid the Soviet Government $1,166,400. 

THE PULITZER FOUNDATION 

Pulitzer, Joseph, an American editor and newspaper proprietor, and who in his lifetime had 
given liberally, in 1903, endowed the School of Journalism of Columbia University, opened in 1912. 
In his will he established a scries of prizes known as the Pulitzer prizes, to be awarded annually for 
letters, the drama, music and newspaper work. He founded 12 five-year collegiate scholarships of 
$250 annually for poor and meritorious boy graduates of the New York public schools. 

These foundations are dedicated to all kinds of research activities for advancing the happiness of 
the people of the United States in particular and of the entire world in general. 

"FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT MEMORIAL FOUNDATION" 

Scarcely eight months after the death of President Quezon in the United States, 
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt of the United States went to his grave. Today 
the American people, as a testimonial of their recognition of the great service rendered 
by President Roosevelt to his people and to the world, are going to establish a memo- 
rial foundation in his honor, according to former Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, 
President of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Foundation in his announcement 
reported in the Manila Times of April 14, 1947. As a living memorial the foundation 
is planning the establishment of a system of international scholarships to bring students 
to the United States from all over the world. In this way the "Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt Memorial Foundation" will be of great benefit not only to the people of 
the United States but to the people throughout the world. 

In on article entitled "Roosevelt and Quezon Linked by Destiny in Memory of 
Filipinos," published in the Manila Tribune- of April 14, 1947 by Dr. Pedro J. Velasco, 
member of the Quezon Memorial Committee, the close contact between the two late 
Presidents in their common efforts for the welfare of both peoples and the preserva- 
tion of their independence, is disclosed. Dr. Velasco says: 

"The relationship between them began when President Quezon was sent by the 
Philippine Legislature to secure from the American Congress a new Independence Act. 
President Quezon was able to convince the then new American President (Roosevelt) 
and the latter recommended the Tydings-McDuffie Law and Congress approved it. 



27 



"Quezon's second signal triumph was achieved when he persuaded General Mac- 
Arthur, then Chief of Staff of the U. S. Army, to come over, to the Philippines as 
military adviser of the new Commonwealth. President Roosevelt readily consented to 
part with the invaluable services of General MacArthur as Chief of Staff for the sake 
of the future safety of the Filipino people. 

"The Filipino people will soon erect a Foundation in honor of President Quezon. 
The Quezon Memorial Committee is raising voluntary contributions of the people for 
this purpose. In view of the close association that existed between the two Presidents, 
both of whom became international figures, the Quezon Foundation will also be con- 
sidered as a spiritual monument to the great American President, the redeemer of 
subject peoples" 

LET US HAVE A QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION 

It is high time that we Filipinos should have a similar foundation established for 
the same ends, not necessarily to the same extent but in a more moderate proportion 
entirely within our financial capacity. And it is but proper and fitting that this 
foundation should be named after the most distinguished son of the country whose 
patriotic services throughout his life made it possible for us to gain our freedom — 
not in the field of battle, nor through bloodshed but in the field of practical wisdom 
and dispassionate controversial discussion. A fitting memorial can be made to honor 
the memory of President Quezon whose services in the preservation of our democratic 
way of life is universally recognized with the organization of the Quezon Memorial 
Fund. 

Our definite plan is to erect a building symbolic of the nobility, achievements and 
prestige of our late President. This building will house the Quezoniana Library and 
Museum containing all mementos, souvenirs, historical or artistic objects, symbolic of 
his heroic efforts to make our country recognized and regarded as one of the inde- 
pendent countries in the world. 

As an independent nation, we cannot afford to waste human talent — the talent 
of our youths which should be devoted to help our country in her reconstruction and 
rehabilitation from her prostrate condition after she has been ruined by this war. 
We need the technical knowledge of our youths in varied lines of human endeavors. 
The Quezon Memorial Foundation will finance these activities. 

It is an axiom that a country should first and foremost help herself before she can 
look up to others for extra help. This FOUNDATION is a patent proof that we are 
endeavoring our utmost to help ourselves in the lines already enumerated. We Filipinos 
should therefore contribute to this FOUNDATION, not only as a fitting expression of 
love, respect and admiration for our late leader, Manuel L. Quezon, but also as a 
demonstration of our desire to improve the service of beneficence and social welfare 
as a realization of his postulate of social justice.

QUEZON MEMORIAL FUND DRIVE 

VIII 



"WE WOULD PREFER TO BE POOR BUT FREE RATHER THAN 
TO BE RICH BUT SUBJECTED!" 



The freedom of the Filipino people was the sacred ideal of the late 
President Quezon. What we are now, we owe it mostly to him. To 
him "there is one thing we cannot, we should not, we must not sacri- 
fice for the sake not even of the whole world — that is, our freedom, 
the rights we already have and those we are struggling to obtain. These 
are not ours only; they are the rights of our people, of our race, of 
our nation — a right that is sacred because it is a God-given right; 
a right that does not belong to one generation of Filipinos, but to all the 
unborn generations. " 

To him, freedom from foreign domination was a sacred ideal. "If 
to be free," he continued, "we must be poor and remain poor, we will 
unanimously and unhesitatingly prefer to be poor but free rather than 
to be rich but subjected! I would be ashamed of my country, I would 
be ashamed of myself, if such was not the definite attitude of all the 
Filipinos in every walk of life." 

Shortly before the date set by the Tydings-McDuffie Law for 
the declaration of our National Independence was approaching, many 
Filipinos advocated for a re-examination of the question because they 
were afraid that the new nation could not withstand the ruins and rav- 
ages of the last war. If the President were then living he would have 
opposed such a movement as an act of national cowardice. 

In memory of that sacred ideal that he had sponsored not for him- 
self but for all of us Filipinos, let us subscribe to the Quezon Memorial as 
a lasting tribute to our great leader. 

"// to be free we must be poor and remain poor, ive will unani- 
mously and unhesitatingly prefer to be poor but free rather than to be 
rich but subjected! I %voidd be ashamed of my counti*y, I would be 
ashamed of myself, if such was not the definite attitude of all the Fi- 
lipinos in every walk of lifer

A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECTS, FEATURES AND SERVICES OF WHICH 
THE PROPOSED MONUMENT OR QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION SHALL CONSIST 

—THE STATUE OF P IESIDENT QUEZON— 

Efforts will be made to make his statue the natural expression of his dynamic character with 
certain reflections on Social Justice. (The engineers and artists will take care to reproduce these de- 
tails through the most brilliant execution of art, to form a combination of beauties, concentrated in a 
colossal symbol of patriotism and humanity.)- 

—THE MAUSOLEUM OF PRESIDENT QUEZON— 

Perhaps the mausoleum will be a happy combination of art in an allegorical design, which will 
show a particular feature of the architectures of the nations in the course of their epochs and centu- 
f . ej w j t jj tne uge of prime materials of the Philippines. (The architects and artists will have the 

final say.) 



30 




—THE SITE OF THE MONUMENT— 
It will be iti 4 a prominent site in Quezon City. The place will be converted into a truly ideal 
park, surrounded *by the wonders of nature, which will attract the continuous pilgrimage of tourists, 
specially the students. When we say "wonders of nature" it is because there will be surprises in the 
global interpretation between practical life and art, science and culture of the Philippines, virtues which 
will constitute part of the treasures of the monument. In that park the splendors of the city will 
blend with the panoramas of nature in a rural and wild atmosphere; the verdour of the park will be a 
pleasure to the eyes and will enhance the health of its inhabitar. visitors and daily guests; there in 
the midst of an enchanting scenery, the rose and true orchid will strive for supremacy in glamour, 
beauty and loveliness — no doubt the landscape experts will lay it out with such perfection as will make 
of it a real botanical garden, pleasant, beautiful and ideal. 

j — THE LIBRARY— 

Inhere is no doubt that it will have 3 good Quczonian Library of international character. The library 
will oe for public use specially the scholars and the students. There arc good probabilities that this 
library will contain valuable materials on the level of progress in its real sense. 

—THE MUSEUM— 

Perhaps one of the best attractions of the Quezon Memorial will be a museum containing rare and 
historical objects to admire, relics of diverse physical expressions with their ethnological characters, 
some of which will be archeological rarities, historical amulets of natives and aborigines, rare ob- 
jects of anthropology, etc. The last war ha. created a very wide field where abound materials for mu- 
seum collections; beside the specific objects and personal appurtenances that have direct or indirect con- 
nection with the private and public life of President Quezon. 

—THE QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION— 

The feeling of humanity and affection towards the unfortunate is innate in al- 
truistic peoples who move with the course of civilization, and an Independent Phil- 
ippines must not only preserve its patrimony as a Christian people, but strengthen 
it, by improving its beneficent facilities, so that without resorting to means of doubt- 
ful decency, they may comfortably shoulder their duties in maintaining a good service 
for social welfare. 

The Foundation will no doubt be the soul and living spirit of the Quezon Monu- 
ment. It is proposed to establish an "Organized Beneficence, ,, from which the Gov- 
ernment itself will derive much benefit. It will be under the control of a board 
of trustees. 

In almost the majority of progressive countries of advanced culture and civilization 
exist institutions of social welfare and security, specially in the United States of America 
where there are not less than fifty kinds of the biggest and the best FOUNDATIONS 
which are engaged in different activities on Beneficence, Sociology, Education, Sciences, 
Eleemosnary, Physical Culture; Medical, Agricultural and Industrial Research, Inter- 
national Peace, Principles of Democracy, Racial Questions, Labor Problems, Public 
Health, Scholarship, Religion, etc. 

— > The abundance in the United States of America, unlike other countries, of its Foundations, has posi- 
tively influenced in the formation of the National Character of the most powerful country m the world, tor 
its Altruism, Democracy and Humanitarian sense. 

While the Axis countries and their allies have branded humanity as idiotism liable 
to degenerate afterwards with the instinct of destruction of the human species and 
Christianity— President Quezon, on the other hand, proclaimed that "Democracy is a 
farce without Social Justice", and strove to outline a policy that produced tangible 
results for the people, particularly to the working masses. 

An accredited institution like the "Quezon Memorial Foundation" would be an 
ideal organization to take charge of an "Organized Beneficence" to supplement the 
Government in the services that it has to render to the public, in this line, which is 

31 



most indispensable for the social welfare. The Government as well as the Red Cross 
and other similar organizations would welcome the creation of another national ins- 
titution intended to help cope with the necessary work of relief that they are required 
to render to the needy. 

The lack, of centralization in this line gives way to many sorts of deceits, mis- 
appropriations of funds and property, yet the services rendered are almost imperceptible, 
although they are good enough as a means of emotional appeal for financial support. 

For this reason, it is deemed proper to establish a new institution to centralize 
certain services, which only give chances to unnecessary overlapping that spoils the good 
will of the few philanthropists in the Philippines; but when we say few, we do not mean 
that many of the privileged class are indifferent towards this Christian duty; on the 
contrary, everybody knows that the sentiment of Christianity is common among the 
Filipinos but on the other hand no organization solidly established with popular support 
has had the courage to take the initiative of shouldering this mission, to stimulate those 
who are altruists and philanthropists, capable of cooperating disinterestedly with full 
devotion and for this purpose, it is planned to create the "Quezon Memorial Founda- 
tion" which will -be the ideal institution to perform this great service of social justice 
within certain limits, under proper regulation. 

—A GALLERY OF FILIPINO HEROES AND MARTYRS— 

This hallowed hall will be a part of the museum and will undoubtedly attract the admiration of 
cosmopolitan people; who knows! It will be a solemn hall containing the historical figures in 
natural size (made of wax) of the Filipino heroes and martyrs who strove for justice and liberty for the 
Philippines, from Lapu-lapu, Soliman, Burgos, Bonifacio, Rizal, Mabini, Marcelo del Pilar, Luna, Gregorio 
del Pilar, to President Quezon with the other heroes of Bataan and Corregidor. 

The hall will be decorated with fine engravings of different anthropological groups of the Philip- 
pine race. 

Beautiful sarcophagi representing symbolic figures and emblems of heroism in an array of art will 
give pre-eminence to the whole in full harmony with the tolemnity of the hall of the "Quezon Foun- 
dation". 

—SEEDS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE— 

Appeal must be made to public opinion that the Quezon Memorial Fund Drive 
must not be affected by party differences although we are the first to respect the prin- 
ciples and political reactions of every one, inasmuch as all have the right to freedom of 
action within our democratic set-up; we wish, however, to remind everybody that this 
noble undertaking is purely of a civic nature, its main purpose being to show the popular 
recognition and gratitude to the late President Quezon for his patriotic labors and that 
the monument to be erected in his honor will be an institution intended to promote 
national culture and works of beneficence as reminiscent of his social justice pro- 
gram to the end that those in need of relief or some help that will open to them some 
opportunity for betterment, may feel the beneficial effects of the institution. Quezon 
sowed the seeds of social justice, and so the Committee is desirous of seeing to it that the 
erection of the monument will give birth to a FOUNDATION that will continue ren- 
dering services to the people. 

It is understood that the Committee will do its best to have the FOUNDATION 
render the services mentioned, provided the goal set for in this drive will be fully covered 
to defray the cost of construction of this huge project. 

All of us, therefore, must give our contributions and ask others to help also in 
the realization of this work of national importance.

[E REPUBLIC OF THE* "PHILIPPINES AND ITS INSTITU- 
ARE AS MUCH PRESIDENT QUEZON'S WORKS AS THEY 
COULD BE OF ANY SINGLE MAN" 

President Roxas paid the late President Quezon high tribute by say- 
ing that "we are a free people and a free nation, in large part, because 
of President Quezon. That our present government, the Republic and 
its institutions are as much his work as they could be of any single 
man and they constitute his perpetual monument. "In recalling his 
life/' he continued, "we recall the story of the modern growth of our 
nation. His climb to fame and leadership is a tale which must be told 
to all our generations. The spirit which broke the bonds of personal 
poverty which hurdled every obstacle because there was none great 
enough to stay him, is one of the proudest products of our race: His 
name is truly a glittering ornament of this nation." 

We can therefore claim that President Quezon was the founder of 
the Philippine Republic as Washing/ton was the founder of the Amer- 
ican Republic. He will go down in history as the father of this Coun- 
try. 

True to the ideals for which he had labored and died, let us con- 
tribute our share to the Quezon Memorial as a token of our undying 
gratitude for our late President Manuel L. Quezon. 

"President Quezon's climb to fame and ledership is a tale which

"PRESIDENT QUEZON KNEW THE HISTOKY OF HIS COUN- 
TRY AND REALIZED HOW HIS PEOPLE STRUGGLED IN ORDER 
TO REGAIN THE FREEDOM ENJOYED BY THEIR ANCESTORS." 

Our late President Quezon was considered by the competent lead- 
ers of the world as one of the foremost six leaders of his age. This 
observation was based on his personality, competence, and achievement. 
Had he been born in Europe, or in America, or India, he would have 
been the foremost leader in any one of those countries. 

As a tribute to President Quezon's leadership, Speaker Perez of the 
House of Representatives of our Congress said, "President Quezon knew 
the history of his country, how his people struggled in order to regain 
the freedom enjoyed by their ancestors previous to the coming of alien 
rulers to these shores. Realizing the great need of reestablishing the 
dignity of his people in the eyes of the free-loving peoples of the world, 
he took upon himself the mission of carrying out a campaign for the 
liberation of his country, first in the field of battle, then in his gov- 
ernment, then in the halls of U.S. Congress until he was able to get 
the assurance of the American People that the Independence of the 
Philippines would be granted as soon as a stable form of government 
could be established. From that as 'a starting point, it became com- 
paratively less difficult for his people to get Congress grant them another 
big concession which is the establishment of the Republic of the Phil- 
ippines. 

"In all his struggles for this libertarian crusade, he made it clear 
first that he was a Filipino having been born in this country and was 
proud to be so; that the Philippines is one of the best countries that 
God has ever created; that before he would make his last journey to the 
other world, he would see to it that thru his dynamic leadership it is 
led into the promised land of liberation. And he was so proud not only 
that he was a Filipino, but also that his countrymen raised and elevat- 
ed him "from the lowest rung of the ladder to the highest seat of author- 
ity in the gift of his people." 

The Philippines, therefore, has the more reason to feel proud of 
him. Let us contribute our share towards the construction of an appro- 
priate Quezon Memorial, befitting the brilliance of his personality, com- 
petence, achievement and service to his people and country. 

"In all his struggles for this libertarian crusade, he made it clear 
first that he was a Filipino, born in this country and was proud to be 
so, that the Philippines is one of the best countries that God has ever ' 
created; that before he would make his last journey to the other ivorld, 
he would see to it that through his dynamic leadership it is led- into 
the promised land of liberation."

tails through the most brilliant execution of art, to form a combination of beauties, concentrated in a 
colossal symbol of patriotism and humanity.) ( 



—THE MAUSOLEUM OF PRESIDENT QUEZON — 

Perhaps the mausoleum will be a happy combination of art in an allegorical design, which will 
show a particular feature of the architectures of the nations in the course of their epochs and centu- 
ries — with the use of prime materials of the Philippines. (The architects and artists will have the 
final say.) 

—THE SITE OF THE MONUMENT— 

It will be in a prominent site in Quezon City. The place will be converted into a truly ideal 
park, surrounded by the wonders of nature, which will attract the continuous pilgrimage of tourists, 
specially the students. When we say "wonders of nature" it is because there will be surprises in the 
global interpretation between practical life and art, science and culture of the Philippines, virtues which 
will constitute part of the treasures of the monument. In that park the splendors of the city will 
blend with the panoramas of nature in a rural and wild atmosphere; the verdour of the park will be a 
pleasure to the eyes and will enhance the health of its inhabitants, visitors and daily guests; there in 
the midst of an enchanting scenery, the rose and the orchid will strive for supremacy in glamour, 
beauty and loveliness — no doubt the landscape experts will lay it out with such perfection as will make 
of it a real botanical garden, pleasant, beautiful and ideal. 

—THE LIBRARY — 

There is no doubt that it will have a good Quezonian Library of international character. The library 
will be for public use specially the scholars and the students. There are v .good probabilities that this 
library will contain valuable materials on the level of progress in its real sense. 

—THE MUSEUM— 

Perhaps one of the best attractions of the Quezon Memorial will be a museum containing rare and 
historical objects to admire, relics of diverse physical expressions with their ethnological characters, 
some of which will be archeological rarities, historical amulets of natives and aborigines', rare ob- 
jects of anthropology, etc- The last war has created a very wide field where abound materials for mu- 
seum collections; beside the specific objects and personal appurterpnees that have direct or indirect con- 
nection with the private and public life of President Quezon. 

—THE QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION — 

The feeling of humanity and affection towards the unfortunate is innate in al- 
truistic peoples who move with the course of civilization, and an Independent Phil- 
ippines must not only preserve its patrimony as a Christian people, but strengthen 
it, by improving its beneficent facilities, so that without resorting to means of doubt- 
ful decency, they may comfortably shoulder their duties in maintaining a good service 
for social welfare. 

The Foundation will no doubt be the soul and living spirit of the Quezon Monu- 
ment. It is proposed to establish an "Organized Beneficence," from which the Gov- 
ernment itself will derive much benefit. It will be under the control of a board 
of trustees. * 

In almost the majority of progressive countries of advanced culture and civilization 
exist institutions of social welfare and security, specially in the United States of America 
where there are not less than fifty kinds of the biggest and the best FOUNDATIONS 
which are engaged in different activities on Beneficence, Sociology, Education, Sciences, 
Eleemosnary, Physical Culture; Medical, Agricultural and Industrial Research, Inter- 
national Peace, Principles of Democracy, Racial Questions, Labor Problems, Public 
Health, Scholarship, Religion, etc. 

p T/ Je a b nm la}icc in the United States of America, unlike other countries, of its Foundations, has posi- 
tively influenced in the formation of the National Character of the most powerful country in the world, for 
its Altruism, Democracy and Humanitarian sense. 

While the Axis countries and their allies have branded humanity as idiotism liable 
to degenerate afterwards with the instinct of destruction of the human species and 
Christianity — President Quezon, on the other hand, proclaimed that "Democracy is a 
farce without Social Justice", and strove to outline a policy that produced tangible 
results for the people, particularly to the working masses. 

An accredited institution like the "Quezon Memorial Foundation" would be an 
ideal organization to take charge of an "Organized Beneficence" to supplement the 



I Government in the services that it has to render to the public, in this line, which is 
most indispensable for the social welfare. The Government as well as the Red Cross 
and other similar organizations would welcome the creation of another national ins- 
titution intended to help cope with the necessary work of relief that they are required 
to render to the needy. 

The lack of centralization in this line gives way to many sorts of. deceits, mis- 
appropriations of funds and property, yet the services rendered are almost imperceptible, 
although they are good enough as a means of emotional appeal for financial support. 

For this reason, it is deemed proper to establish a new institution to centralize 
certain services, which only give chances to unnecessary overlapping that spoils the good 
will of the few philanthropists in the Philippines; but when we say few, we do not mean 
that many of the privileged class are indifferent towards this Christian duty; on the 
contrary, everybody knows that the sentiment of Christianity is common among the 
Filipinos but on the other hand no organization solidly established with popular support 
has had the courage to take the initiative of shouldering this mission, to stimulate those 
who are altruists and philanthropists, capable of cooperating disinterestedly with full 
devotion and for this purpose, it is planned to create the "Quezon Memorial Founda- 
tion" which will be the ideal institution to perform this great service of social justice 
within certain limits, under proper regulation. 

—A GALLERY OF FILIPINO HEROES AND MARTYRS — 

This hallowed hall will be a part of the museum and will undoubtedly attract the admiration of 
cosmopolitan people; who knows! It will be a solemn hall containing the historical figures in 
natural size (made of wax) of the Filipino heroes anoj. martyrs who strove for justice and liberty for the 
Philippines, from Lapu-lapu, Soliman, Burgos, Bonifacio, Rizal, Mabini, Marcelo del Pilar, Luna, Gregorio 
del Pilar, to President Quezon with the other heroes of Bataan and Corregidor. 

The hall will be decorated with fine engravings of different anthropological groups of the Philip- 
pine race. 

Beauciful sarcophagi representing symbolic figures and emblems of heroism in an array of art will 
give pre-eminence to the whole in full harmony with the solemnity of the hall of the "Quezon Foun- 
dation". 

—SEEDS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE— 

Appeal must be made to public opinion that the Quezon Memorial Fund Drive 
must not be affected by party differences although we are the first to respect the prin- 
ciples ;md political reactions of every one, inasmuch as all have the right to freedom of 
action within our democratic set-up; we wish, however, to remind everybody that this 
noble undertaking is purely of a civic nature, its main purpose being to show the popular 
recognition and gratitude to the late President Quezon for his patriotic labors and that 
the monument to be erected in his honor will be an institution intended to promote 
national culture and works of beneficence as reminiscent of his social justice pro- 
gram to the end that those in need of relief or some help that will open to them some 
opportunity for betterment, may- feel the beneficial effects of the institution. Quezon 
sowed the seeds of social justice, and so the Committee is desirous of seeing to it that the 
erection of the monument will give birth to a FOUNDATION that will continue ren- 
dering services to the people. 

It is understood that the Committee will do its best to have the FOUNDATION 
render the services mentioned, provided the goal set for in this drive will be fully covered 
to defray the cost of construction of this huge project. 

AH of us, therefore, must give our contributions and ask others to help also in 
the realization of this work of national importance.

"INSURE HAPPINESS AND CONTENMENT FOR ALL THE 
PEOPLE UNDER THE AEGIS OF LIBERTY AND PEACE" 

As a peace-time leader, he led his people to self-restraint and self- 
discipline, to peace, prosperity and happiness. For without self-con- 
trol, "we shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roar- 
ing torrent, full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. Through self- 
discipline we shall harness all our energies, so that our power, spread- 
ing over the length and breath of this land, will develop its resources, 
advance its culture, secure social justice, give puissance to the nation, 
and insure happiness arid contenment for all the people, under the aegis 
of liberty and peace." 

The relative prosperity attained by the Philippines under his lead- 
ership was due to his statesmanship, for under his guidance the Filipino 
people engaged themselves to the great task of developing their natural 
resources. 

As a war-time leader, he put forth his utmost to insure their pro- 
tection and security — a task so stupenduous that it ultimately cost him 
his life. Let us by all means, if only to show our gratitude, contribute 
to the construction of the Quezon Memorial. 

"Through self-discipline we shall harness all our energies, so that 
our power, spreding over the length and breath of this land, will dev- 
elop its resources, advance its culture, secure social justice, give puis- 
sance to the nation, and insure happiness and contentment for all the 
people, under the aegis of liberty and peace."

"WAR IS UNJUST AS THE DECISION OF THE SWORD DOES 
NOT NECESSARILY ACCORD WITH THE DICTATES OF CON- 
SCIENCE AND OF RIGHT." 

President Quezon fought to regain and maintain the freedom and 
leadership which his fathers had enjoyed before him and at what prize? 
He gave his life for this freedom and on his death bed in foreign soil 
he whispered his last wish that he might be allowed to die and lay his 
bones in the country he so well loved. 

Speaking of tihe war he said: "War is expensive; it has reduced 
many nations to beggary. It is foolish ; there is always a better way 
to settle any difficulty, provided that both sides are willing to substitute 
reason for hatred, prejudice and greed. It is tragic; invariably it 
creates suffering, privation and heart-break. Worst of all, it is unjust; 
the decision of the sword does not necessarily accord with the dictates 
of conscience and of right. ,, 

His remains now rest in the soil of his birth under the tropical 
blue sky that gave him life to serve his country and mankind. 

His remains will be transferred to the Quszon Foundation and kept 
in a magnificent mauseleum that will reflect the glory of his achieve- 
ments for the welfare, freedom and independence of .the Philippines. 

Let us, therefore, express our gratitude for his patriotic service by 
giving our share to the construction of the Quezon Memorial.

Charity was an inborn virtue in President Quezon. Amidst the 
cares of state, he found time to show his love to children by 
giving them of his own food, not out of pity, but in a spirit 
of Christian Chanty.

"CHRISTIANITY'S HIGHEST TEACHING IS TO LOVE OUR FEL- 
LOWMAN. LET US LOVE BY HELPING HIM AND HIS FAMILY 
LIVE HAPPY AND CONTENDED." 

Charity and benevolence toward the poor and the helpless sprung 
from his heart most spontaneously. Without fanfare and publicity, 
President Quezon helped many poor students to finish their studies. 

He believed in and practised Christian charity. He said "It is 
our boast that we are the only Christian nation in the Far East. Our 
boast would be an empty one if we do not show in actual practice that 
we are Christians. Christianity's highest teaching is to love our fel- 
lowman. Let us love by helping him and his family live happy and con- 
tented." 

He said once: "Love is manifested by the kind treatment which we 
give to our fellow-men". He inculcated in his people the productive life 
when he said: "I offer to you the useful life, devoted to self-improve- 
ment and the service of the state. It must be rooted in character self 

discipline and work.* It should glorify productive enterprises, a high 
sense of responsibility, and the ethical virtues. Its objectives are per- 
sonal perfection and social efficiency." (Address at the Rizal Memo- 
rial Stadium on his birthday, 1938.) 

Contribute to the Quezon Memorial that will provide scholarship, 
endowment for the good and benefit of our youth. 

"Christianity's highest teaching* is to love our feUowman.. .Let us

It will be in a prominent lite in Quezon City. The place will be converted into a truly ideal 
park, surrounded by the wonders of nature, which will attract the continuous pilgrimage of tourists, 
specially the students. When we say "wonders of nature" it is because there will be surprises in the 
global interpretation between practical life and art, science and culture of the Philippines, virtues which 
will constitute part of the treasures of the monument. In that park the splendors of the city will 
blend with the panoramas of nature in a rural and wild atmosphere; the verdour of the park will be a 
pleasure to the eyes and will enhance the health of its inhabitants, visitors and daily guests; there in 
• the midst of an enchanting scenery, the rose and the orchid will strive for supremacy in glamour, 
beauty and loveliness — no doubt the landscape experts will lay it out with such perfection as will make 
of it a real botanical garden, pleasant, beautiful and ideal. 

—THE LIBRARY— 

There is no doubt that it will have a good Quezonian Library of international character. The library 
will be for public use specially the scholars and the students. There are good probabilities that this 
library will contain valuable materials on the level of progress in its real sense. 

—THE MUSEUM— 

Perhaps one of the best attractions of the Quezon Memorial will be a museum where there will be 
rare and historical objects to admire, relics of diverse physical expressions with their ethnological charac- 
ters, some of which will be archeological rarities, historical amulets of natives and aborigines, rare ob- 
jects of anthropology, etc. The last war has created a very wide field where abound materials for mu- 
seum collections; beside the specific objects and personal appurtenances that have direct or indirect con- 
nection with the private and public life of President Quezon. 

—THE QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION— 

The feeling of humanity and affection towards the unfortunate is innate in al- 
truistic peoples who move with the course of civilization, and an Independent Phil- 
ippines must not only preserve its patrimony as a Christian people, but strengthen 
it, by improving its beneficent facilities, so that without resorting to means of doubt- 
ful decency, they may comfortably shoulder their duties in maintaining a good service 
for social welfare. 

The Foundation will no doubt be the soul and living spirit of the Quezon Monu- 
ment. It is proposed to establish an "Organized Beneficence," from which the Gov- 
ernment itself will derive much benefit. It will be under the control of a board 
of trusteesT 

In almost the majority of progressive countries of advanced culture and civilization 
exist institutions of social welfare and security, specially in the United States of America 
where there are not less than fifty kinds of the biggest and the best FOUNDATIONS 
which are engaged in different activities on Beneficence, Sociology, Education, Sciences, 
Eleemosnary, Physical Culture; Medical, Agricultural and Industrial Research, Inter- 
national Peace, Principles of Democracy, Racial Questions, Labor Problems, Public 
Health, Scholarship, Religion, etc. 

>The abundance in the United States of America, unlike other countries, of its Foundations, has posi- 
tively influenced in the formation of the National Character of the most powerful country in the world, for 
its Altruism, Democracy and Humanitarian sense. 

While the Axis countries and their allies have branded humanity as idiotism liable 
to degenerate afterwards with the instinct of destruction of the human species and 
Christianity — President Quezon, on the other hand, proclaimed that "Democracy is a 
farce without Social Justice", and strove to outline a policy that produced tangible 
results for the people, particularly to the working masses. 

An accredited institution like the "Quezon Memorial Foundation" would be an 
ideal organization to take charge of an "Organized Beneficence" to supplement the 
Government in the services that it has to render to the public, in this line, which is 



51 



most indispensable for the social welfare. The Government as well as the Red Cross 
and other similar organizations would welcome the creation of another national ins- 
titution intended to help cope with the necessary work of relief that they are required 
to render to the needy. 

The lack of centralization in this line gives way to many sorts of deceits, mis- 
appropriations of funds and property, yet the services rendered are almost imperceptible, 
although they are good enough as a means of emotional appeal for financial support. 

For this reason, it is deemed proper to establish a new institution to centralize 
certain services, which only give chances to unnecessary overlapping that spoils the good 
will of the few philanthropists in the Philippines; but when we say few, we do not mean 
that many of the privileged class are indifferent towards this Christian duty; on the 
contrary, everybody knows that the sentiment of Christianity is common among the 
Filipinos but on the other hand no organization solidly established with popular support 
has had the courage to take the initiative of shouldering this mission, to stimulate those 
who are altruists and philanthropists, capable of cooperating disinterestedly with full 
devotion and for this purpose, it is planned to create the "Quezon Memorial Founda- 
tion" which will be the ideal institution to perform this great service of social justice 
within certain limits, under proper regulation. 

—A GALLERY OF FILIPINO HEROES AND MARTYRS— 

This hallowed hall will be a part of the museum and will undoubtedly attract the admiration of 
cosmopolitan people; who knows! It will be a solemn hall containing the historical figures in 
natural size (made of wax) of the Filipino heroes and martyrs who strove for justice and hberty for the 
Philippines, from Lapu-lapu, Soliman, Burgos, Bonifacio, Rizal, Mabini, Marcelo del Pilar, Luna, Gregorio 
del Pilar, to President Quezon with the other heroes of Bataan and Corregidor. 

The hall will be decorated with fin* engravings of different anthropological groups of the Philip- 
pine race. .... .,, 

Beautiful sarcophagi representing symbolic figures and emblems of heroism in an. array of art will 
give pre-eminence to the whole in full harmony with che solemnity of the hall of the "Quezon Foun- 
dation". 

—SEEDS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE— 

Appeal must be made to public opinion that the Quezon Memorial Fund Drive 
must not be affected by party differences although we are the first to respect the prin- 
ciples and political reactions of every one, inasmuch as all have the right to freedom of 
action within our democratic set T up; we wish, however, to remind everybody that this 
noble undertaking is purely of a civic nature, its main purpose being to show the popular 
recognition and gratitude to the late President Quezon for his patriotic labors and that 
the monument to be erected in his honor will be an institution intended to promote 
national culture and works of beneficence as reminiscent of his social justice pro- 
gram to the end that those in need of relief or some help that will open to them soms 
opportunity for betterment, may feel the beneficial effects of the institution. Quezon 
sowed the seeds of social justice, and so the Committee is desirous of seeing to it that the 
erection of the monument will give birth to a FOUNDATION that will continue ren- 
dering services to the people. 

It is understood that the Committee will do its best to have the FOUNDATION 
render the services mentioned, provided the goal set for in this drive will be fully covered 
to defray the cost of construction of this huge project. 

Alt of us, therefore, must give our contributions and ask others to help also in 
the realization of this work of national importance.

QUEZON MEMORIAL FUND DRIVE 

XIV 



PRESIDENT QUEZON IN HIS LIFETIME NEVER DID ANYTHING 
BY HALF-MEASURES, AND IT CERTAINLY WOULD NOT DO 
CREDIT TO HIS WORK IF WE WERE TO ERECT A MEMORIAL 
WHICH WOULD NOT BE ANYWHERE EQUAL TO HIS GREATNESS 

The Quezon Memorial which the Filipino people are planning to erect 
shall be one that embodies their love, respect and admiration for our 
highly esteemed late President. It is a memorial which is symbolic not 
merely of those attributes but also of the highest aesthetic development 
of the culture of our people. It will be a memorial to our leader as a 
Master Architect in the realization of a higher destiny for his country. 
We should bear in mind that many of our present good fortune, many of 
the blessings we presently enjoy in this struggling world, be they poli- 
tical, economic, social or cultural advancement are in a large measure 
due to our beloved late President. 

President Avelino of the Senate of the Philippines has aptly des- 
cribed the kind of Memorial Monument we should erect to President Que- 
zon in this wise: "It should be the deep concern of every true Filipino 
to see that the raising of the funds for the Quezon Memorial be a great 
success. No one has the right to be niggardly in this respect. Every- 
one must give as much as it is possible for him to give. For on the suc- 
cess of this patriotic enterprise depends much of our ability as a people 
to hold the name of our late leader in appropriate veneration. President 
Quezon in his lifetime never did anything by half-measures, and it cer- 
tainly would not do credit to his work if we were to erect a memorial 
which would not be anywhere equal to his greatness. 

"Our people have a glorious history behind them. This is why even 
as a subject people we never failed to produce men of heroic proportions. 
And now that our country has taken at long last its rightful place in the 
family of nations as free state we cannot afford to fail to come up to 
that standard. We must prove to the world that we are still a proud 
race and that we know how to honor those of our dead who have made 
it their work to provide for us the liberties that we now enjoy. That 
is our national obligation. " 

President AVELINO 



A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECTS, FEATURES AND SERVICES OF WHICH 
THE PROPOSED MONUMENT OR QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION SHALL CONSIST 

—THE STATUE OF PRESIDENT QUEZON— 
Efforts will be made to make his statue the natural expression of his dynamic character with 
certain reflections on Social Justice. (The engineers and artists will take care to reproduce these de- 
tails through the most brilliant execution of art, to form a combination of beauties, concentrated in a 
colossal symbol of patriotism and humanity.) 

—THE MAUSOLEUM OF PRESIDENT QUEZON— 
Perhaps the mausoleum will be a happy combination of art in an allegorical design, which will 
show a particular feature of the architectures of the nations in the course of their epochs and centu- 
ries — with the use of prime materials of the Philippines. (The architects and artists will have the 
final say.) 



—THE SITE OF. THE MONUMENT—

WE ARE PROUD OF MANUEL LUIS QUEZON BECAUSE HE LOVED 
HIS PEOPLE DEARLY AND HAD AN ABIDING FAITH IN THEM 



When President Quezon was met by President Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt and the members of his Cabinet at the Union Station at 
Washington, D. C. upon his arrival in 1942 or shortly after the outbreak 
of the last World War and the doors of the White House were thrown 
wide open to receive him, it was properly emphasized that it was a sig- 
nal honor being accorded by America not merely to President Quezon 
but to the Filipino people. 

What he contributed to the Allies in what proved to be a superhuman 
effort to snatch from the hands of the enemy the freedom and demo- 
cracy that were in actual peril of being lost, was a great credit not only 
to the Filipino people but also to the Malayan race, and proved to be a 
boon to every liberty-loving nation throughout the entire world and for 
all time. 

Secretary of the Interior Jose C. Zulueta in paying a tribute to this 
Statesman of universal renown said: "A firm believer in a government 
of law instead of a government of men, he was the first Filipino leader 
to condemn favoritism and nepotism in the service of the government. 
As a consequence of his sound policies, he commanded the respect, not 
only of his friends, but also of his enemies as well. He knew the value 
of tolerance and had a high regard for the opinions of others. This was 
the secret with which he maintained the loyalty of the men around him. 

"We are all proud of Manuel Luis Quezon, not because he was never 
defeated in any election ; not because he rose from a mere working stud- 
ent to tne Presidency of the Philippine Commonwealth. We are proud 
of him because he was proud of us, because under no circumstance did 
he ever admit in life that another race existed in the world that could be 
superior to the Filipino people. We are proud of him because he was 
willing to risk everything and anything he had for the principles of jus- 
tice, liberty, and equality sacred to us and our ancestors. We are proud 
of Manuel Luis Quezon because he loved, his people dearly and had an 
abiding faith in them." 

We are proud of him because he was proud of us. because under no 
circumstance did he ever admit in life that another race existed in the 
ivorld that coidd be superior to the Filipino people.

The lack of centralization in this line gives way to many sorts of deceits, mis-

LET US HAVE A QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION 




President Quezon not only preached social justice as Chief of State; as a land- 
lord he gave a practical example by increasing the share of the tenants. The above 
picture, taken in a moment of relaxation in his Arayat plantation, shows him distribut 
ing the boon of his generosity to his tenants.

PRESIDENT QUEZON HAD THE WELFARE OF THE LABOR 
POPULATION AT HEART — IT WAS HIS FERVENT DESIRE TO 
HAVE HEALTHY, EFFICIENT AND HAPPY LABORERS 

The late President Manuel L. Quezon was the patron of the labor- 
ers. To him, they were foremost in his heart. It was always his wish- 
es "to pay good wages to our laborers, to give them proper nourishment, 
proper nutrition which means health. A healthy laborer can do more 
and better work than one who is sickly and underfed/' 

Through his career as a public servant to his country, primarily as 
a legislator and as chief executive, President Quezon had always taken 
particular interest in improving the lot and welfare of the laboring 
class. The masses loved him to the same extent that he loved them. 
If the late President had our welfare at heart, it is but proper that we 
show our profound gratitude to him by supporting the movement to erect 
a monument in his honor. 

The postulate of Social Justice inserted in our Constitution has 
been inspired by the late President. And in his life-time he was able 
to translate such Social Justice into reality. 

Let us contribute to the Quezon Memorial fund. We feel sure 
that the labor population will gladly give their corresponding share to 
this worthy cause. 

Let us make the movement a success. Its success is the common 
success of all. . 

'To pay good wages to our laborers, to give them proper nourish- 
ment, proper mutrition tvhich means health."

"THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES AND ITS INSTITU- 
TIONS ARE AS MUCH PRESIDENT QUEZON'S WORKS AS THEY 
COULD BE OF ANY SINGLE MAN" 

President Roxas paid the late President Quezon high tribute by say- 
ing that "we are a free people and a free nation, in large part, because 
of President Quezon. That our present government, the Republic and 
its institutions are as much his work as they could be of any single 
man and they constitute his perpetual monument. "In recalling his 
life/' he continued, "we recall the story of the modern growth of our 
nation. His climb to fame and leadership is a tale which must be told 
to all our generations. The spirit which broke the bonds of personal 
poverty which hurdled every obstacle because there was none great 
enough to stay him, is one of the proudest products of our race: His 
name is truly a glittering ornament of this nation." 

We can therefore claim that President Quezon was the founder of 
the Philippine Republic as Washington was the founder of the Amer- 
ican Republic. He will go down in history as the father of this Coun- 
try. 

True to the ideals for which he had labored and died, let us con- 
tribute our share to the Quezon Memorial as a token of our undying 
gratitude for our late President Manuel L. Quezon. 

"President Quezon's climb to fame and ledership is a tale ivhich 
must be told to all our generations."

QUEZON MEMORIAL FUND DRIVE

"PRESIDENT QUEZON KNEW THE HISTORY OF HIS COUN- 
TRY AND REALIZED HOW HIS PEOPLE STRUGGLED IN ORDER 
TO REGAIN THE FREEDOM ENJOYED BY THEIR ANCESTORS." 

Our late President Quezon was considered by the competent lead- 
ers of the world as one of the foremost six leaders of his age. This 
observation was based on his personality, competence, and achievement. 
Had he been born in Europe, or in America, or India, he would have 
been the foremost leader in any one of those countries. 

As a tribute to President Quezon's leadership, Speaker Perez of the 
House of Representatives of our Congress said, "President Quezon knew 
the history of his country, how his people struggled in order to regain 
the freedom enjoyed by their ancestors previous to the coming of alien 
rulers to these shores. Realizing the great need of reestablishing the 
dignity of his people in the eyes of the free-loving peoples of the world, 
he took upon himself the mission of carrying out a campaign for the 
liberation of his country, first in the field of battle, then in his gov- 
ernment, then in the halls of U.S. Congress until he was able to get 
the assurance of the American People that the Independence of the 
Philippines would be granted as soon as a stable form of government 
could be established. From that as a starting, point, it became com- 
paratively less difficult for his people to get Congress grant them another 
big concession which is the establishment of the Republic of the Phil- 
ippines. 

"In all his struggles for this libertarian crusade, he made it clear 
first that he was a Filipino having been born in this country and was 
proud to be so; that the Philippines is one of the best countries that 
God has ever created; that before he would make his last journey to the 
other world, he would see to it that thru his dynamic leadership it is 
led into the promised land of liberation. And he was so proud not only 
that he was a Filipino, but also that his countrymen raised and elevat- 
ed him "from the lowest rung of the ladder to the highest seat of author- 
ity in the gift of his people. " 

The Philippines, therefore, has the more reason to feel proud of 
him. Let us contribute our share towards the construction of an appro- 
priate Quezon Memorial, befitting the brilliance of his personality, com- 
petence, achievement and service to his people and country. 

"In all his struggles for this libertarian crusade, he made it clear 
first that he was a Filipino, born in this country and was proud to be 
so, that the Philippines is one of the best countries that God has ever 
created; that before he would make his last journey to the other ivorld, 
he would see to it that through his dynamic leadership it is led into

beauty and loveliness — no doubt the landscape experts will lay it out with such perfection as will make Q 
of it a real botanical garden, pleasant, beautiful and ideal. ^

—THE LIBRARY — d 
There is no doubt that it will have a good Quezonian Library of international character. The library q 
will be for public use specially the scholars and the students. There are good probabilities that this 
library will contain valuable materials on the level of progress in its real sense. 3 

—THE MUSEUM— . £ 

Perhaps one of the best attractions of the Quezon Memorial will be a museum containing rare and o£ 
historical objects to admire, relics of diverse physical expressions with their ethnological characters, 2 
some of which will be archeological rarities, historical amulets of natives and aborigines, rare ob- 
jects of anthropology, etc. The last war has created a very wide field where abound materials for mu- ^ 
seum collections; beside the specific objects and personal appurtenances that have direct or indirect con- — i 
nection with the private and public life of President Quezon. j£ 

—THE QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION— 2 

The feeling of humanity and affection towards the unfortunate is innate in al- to 
truistic peoples who move with the course of civilization, and an Independent Phil- I 
ippines must not only preserve its patrimony as a Christian people, but strengthen ^ 
it, by improving its beneficent facilities, so that without resorting to means of doubt- O 
ful decency, they may comfortably shoulder their duties in maintaining a good service £ 
for social welfare. 

The Foundation will no doubt be the soul and living spirit of the Quezon Monu- £j 
ment. It is proposed to establish an "Organized Beneficence," from which the Gov- 
ernment itself will derive much benefit. It will be under the control of a board q 
of trustees. All the independent countries of advanced culture and civilization main- O 
tain bureaus or institutions of social security and welfare of this nature, well ad- < 
ministered. £ 

While the Axis countries and their allies have branded humanity as idiotism liable 5 
to degenerate afterwards with the instinct of destruction of the human species and 
Christianity — President Quezon, on the other hand, proclaimed that "democracy is a < 
farce without social justice," and ,strove to outline a policy that produced tangible 
results for the masses. 

An accredited institution like the "Quezon Memorial Foundation" would be an 
ideal organization to take charge of an "Organized Beneficence" to supplement the 
Government in the services that it has to render to the public, in this line, which is 
most indispensable for the social welfare. The Government as well as the Red Cross 
and other similar organizations would welcome the creation of another national ins- 
titution intended to help cope with the necessary work of relief that they are required 
to render to the needy. 

39 



The lack of centralization in this line gives way to many sorts of deceits, mis- 
appropriations of funds and property, yet the services rendered are almost imperceptible, 
although they are good enough as ;i means of emotional appeal for financial support. 

For this reason, it is deemed proper to establish a new institution to centralize 
certain services, which only give chances to unnecessary overlapping that spoils the good 
will of the few philanthropists in the Philippines; but when we say few, we do not mean 
that many of the privileged class are indifferent towards this Christian duty; on the 
contrary, everybody knows that the sentiment of Christianity is common among the 
Filipinos but on the other hand no organization solidly established with popular support 
has had the courage to take the initiative of shouldering this mission, to stimulate those 
who are altruists and philanthropists, capable of cooperating disinterestedly with full 
devotion and for this purpose, it is planned to create the "Quezon Memorial Founda- 
tion" which will be the ideal institution to perform this great service of social justice 
within certain limits, under proper regulation. 

—A GALLERY OF FILIPINO HEROES AND MARTYRS— 

This hallowed hall will be a part of the museum and will undoubtedly attract the admiration of 
cosmopolitan people; who knows! It will be a solemn hall containing the historical figures in 
natural size (made of wax) of the Filipino heroes and martyrs who strove for justice and liberty for the 
Philippines, from Lapu-lapu, Soliman, Burgos, Bonifacio, Rizal, Mabini, Marcclo del Pilar, Luna, Gregorio 
del Pilar, to President Quezon with the other heroes of Bataan and Corregidor. 

The hall will be decorated with fine engravings of different anthropological groups of the Philip- 
pine race. 

Beautiful sarcophagi representing symbolic figures and emblems of heroism in an array of art Will 
give pre-eminence to the whole in full harmony with the solemnity of the hall of the "Quezon Foun- 
dation". 

—SEEDS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE— 

Appeal must be made to public opinion that the Quezon Memorial Fund Drive 
must not be affected by party differences although we are the first to respect the prin- 
ciples and political reactions of every one, inasmuch as all have the right to freedom of 
action within our democratic set-up; we wish, however, to remind everybody that this 
noble undertaking is purely of a civic nature, its main purpose being to show the popular 
recognition and gratitude to the late President Quezon for his patriotic labors and that 
the monument to be erected in his honor will be an institution intended to promote 
national culture and works of beneficence as reminiscent of his social justice pro- 
gram to the end that those in need of relief or some help that will open to them some 
opportunity for betterment, may feel the beneficial effects of the institution. Quezon 
sowed the seeds of social justice, and so the Committee is desirous of seeing to it that the 
erection of the monument will give birth to a FOUNDATION that will continue ren- 
dering services to the people. 

It is understood that the Committee will do its best to have the FOUNDATION 
render the services mentioned, provided the goal set for in this drive will be fully covered 
to defray the cost of construction of this huge project. 

All of us, therefore, must give our contributions and ask others to help also in 
the realization of this work of national importance.

» FOUNDATIONS AND THEIR SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE 



"THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION" 

The United States lias a number of foundations established primarily to promote the welfare of 
humanity in all lines of human endeavor. The Rockefeller Foundation, a philanthropic trust, was incor- 
porated by Act of the N. Y. Legislature of May 14, 1913. By the terms of the Act, the trustees were 
constituted a body corporate with power to receive and manage funds for the purpose of "promoting 
the well-being of mankind throughout the world," through charitable, religious, missionary and educa- 
tional activities as well as through research and publication. The Foundation received gifts aggregating 
$100,000,000 from John D. Rockefeller and $48,000 in trust for specific purposes from Mrs. John D. 
Rockefeller. The management of the Foundation is practically unrestricted in respect to the business 
activities it may undertake in the interest of the Foundation. 

The activities upon which the Foundation has entered cover a wide range of affairs. Among the 
most important was the organization of a world-wide campaign against the hookworm disease; the 
establishment of the China Medical Commission for the promotion of public health and medical 
education in China; the creation of an Industrial Relations Investigation Division for conducting a 
itudy of the relations of capital and labor; the foundation of a War Relief Commission to cooperate 
with the Commission for Relief in Belgium; work in cooperation with the Red Cross Society to check 
the ravages of typhus in Serbia. 

THE LAURA SPELMAN ROCKEFELLER MEMORIAL FOUNDATION 

In 1929 the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Fund of $2,500,000 was combined with the 
Rockefeller Foundation. The plan of work adopted provided for cooperation toward the advancement 
of knowledge in the fields of public health, the medical sciences, the natural sciences (taking over the 
foreign program of the International Educational Board),' the social sciences (formerly the province of 
the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial), and the humanities. For the administration of the program 
in public health, an international health division was created. 

The International Health Division assists in projects for improving public health, not only in the 
U. S. but also in foreign countries. This aid includes participation in studies of yellow fever, malaria, 
hookworm disease, tuberculosis and respiratory diseases; in campaigns for the reduction of malaria 
and hookworm disease control.. Assistance also is given toward the work of the health organization 
of the League of Nations. 

The Natural Sciences. Under this division are included contributions toward endowments, build- 
ing programs, apparatus and equipment, maintenance and general development of universities and scien- 
tific institutions. 

The Medical Sciences. Grants are made in the form of endowments or contributions toward 
constructive programs or developments, or toward maintenance of a number of institutions; and for 
special projects to medical schools engaged in research important to the advancement of medical 
knowledge. The Foundation also grants and administers fellowships in medicine for graduate students 
to enable them to study in countries other than their own. In addition, it makes grants toward 
studies of hospital service and the training of executives for such service. 

The Social Sciences. Under this division are grouped all grants for the advancement of sociolo- 
gical research, public administration, economic research, child study, industrial psychology, anthro- 
pological study and mental hygiene. 

The Humanities. In this field the Foundation makes grants to universities and institutions for 
the advancement of humanistic studies and classical learning. 

THE CARNEGIE FOUNDATION 

Carnegie Foundation for the advancement of teaching (N. Y.) — This was founded originally 
in 1905 to provide pensions for teachers in the form of free gifts. The system was at first non- 
contributory, but after elaborate investigation, a new system was adopted by which colleges and 
teachers both contribute on a properly calculated actuarial basis. The Foundation has under- 
taken inquiries in the field of education, and issued reports. Its capital and reserves amount to 
nearly $30,000,000. 

THE JOHN SIMON GUGGENHEIM MEMORIAL FOUNDATION 

Guggenheim, Simon, an American legislator, in li>2 5, in memory of their son, he and his wife 
established the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial ¥oiintlalion for scholarships for advanced study 
abroad. 



26 



THE RUSSEL SAGE FOUNDATION 
Sage, Russell, an American capitalist, left about $75,000,000 unconditionally to his widow, Mar- 
garet Olivia Slocum Sage. Her benefactions were correspondingly large, and included $10,000,000 to 
the Russell 'Sage Voundation to improve the social and living conditions of the U. S M 1907; over 
$3,500,000 to educational purposes, and $300,000 for the Sage Institute of Pathology. She died Nov. 
4, 1918, and by her will over $50,000,000 was distributed to charities, hospitals, and ' educational 
institutions. 

THE MELLON FOUNDATION 

Mellon, Andrew William, 3n American financier and public official, donated to the U. ■ S. Gov- 
ernment his collection of paintings by old masters, valued at $19,000,000, and the sum of $8,000,000 
for the erection of a National Gallery of Art. There are about seventy paintings in the collection. 
Among Mr. Mcllon's stipulations were the following: that additions to the collection shall meet a high Z 
standard; that the building in which they are housed, to be designed by John Russel Pope, shall be 2 
erected on the mall near the Smithsonian Institution; that it shall not bear the Mellon name; that the O 
Smithsonian Institution shall supervise the project; and that Congress shall provide for the upkeep of -j 
the building. For one of the pictures in the collection, Raphael's Madonna of the House of Alba, O 
Mr. Mellon paid the Soviet Government $1,166,400. 

THE PULITZER FOUNDATION g 

Pulitzer, Joseph, an American editor and newspaper proprietor, and who in his lifetime had ^ 

given liberally, in 1903, endowed the School of Journalism of Columbia University, opened in 1912. g 
In his will he established a scries of prizes known as the Pulitzer prizes, to be awarded annually for 

letters, the drama, music and newspaper work. He founded 12 five-year collegiate scholarships of :~ 

$250 annually for poor and meritorious boy graduates of the New York public schools. j- 

These foundations are dedicated to all kinds of research activities for advancing the happiness of 2 
the people of the United States in particular and of the entire world in general. 

"FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT MEMORIAL FOUNDATION" g 

Scarcely eight months after the death of President Quezon in the United States, *" 
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt of the United States went to his grave. Today o 
the American people, as a testimonial of their recognition of the great service rendered 
by President Roosevelt to his people and to the world, are going to establish a memo- 
rial foundation in his honor, according to former Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, £ 
President of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Foundation in his announcement S£ 
reported in the Manila Times of April 14, 1947. As a living memorial the foundation O 
is planning the establishment of a system of international scholarships to bring students ° 
to the United States from all over the world. In this way the "Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt Memorial Foundation'' will be of great benefit not only to the people of - 
the United States but to the people throughout the world. O- 

In on article entitled "Roosevelt and Quezon Linked by Destiny in Memory of < 
Filipinos," published in the Manila Tribune of April 14, 1947 by Dr. Pedro J. Velasco, 
member of the Quezon Memorial Committee, the close contact between the two late 
Presidents in their common efforts for the welfare of both peoples and the preserva- 
tion of their independence, is disclosed. Dr. Velasco says: 

"The relationship between them began when President Quezon was sent by the 
Philippine Legislature to secure from the American Congress a new Independence Act. 
President Quezon was able to convince the then new American President (Roosevelt) 
and the latter recommended the Tydings-McDuffie Law and Congress approved it. 



27 



"Quezon's second signal triumph was achieved when he persuaded General Mac- 
Arthur, then Chief of Staff of the U. S. Army, to come over, to the Philippines as 
military adviser of the new Commonwealth. President Roosevelt readily consented to 
part with the invaluable services of General MacArthur as Chief of Staff for the sake 
of the future safety of the Filipino people. 

"The Filipino people will soon erect a Foundation in honor of President Quezon. 
The Quezon Memorial Committee is raising voluntary contributions of the people for 
this purpose. In view of the close association that existed between the two Presidents, 
both of whom became international figures, the Quezon Foundation will also be con- 
sidered as a spiritual monument to the great American President, the redeemer of 
subject peoples " 

LET US HAVE A QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION 

It is high time that we Filipinos should have a similar foundation established for 
the same ends, not necessarily to the same extent but in a more moderate proportion 
entirely within our financial capacity. And it is but proper and fitting that this 
foundation should be named after the most distinguished son of the country whose 
patriotic services throughout his life made it possible for us to gain our freedom — 
not in the field of battle, nor through bloodshed but in the field of practical wisdom 
and dispassionate controversial discussion. A fitting memorial can be made to honor 
the memory of President Quezon whose services in the preservation of our democratic 
way of life is 'universally recognized with the organization of the Quezon Memorial 
Fund. 

Our definite plan is to erect a building symbolic of the nobility, achievements and 
prestige of our late President. This building will house the Quezoniana Library and 
Museum containing all mementos, souvenirs, historical or artistic objects, symbolic of 
his heroic efforts to make our country recognized and regarded as one of the inde- 
pendent countries in the world. 

As an independent nation, we cannot afford to waste human talent — the talent 
of our youths which should be devoted to help our country in her reconstruction and 
rehabilitation from her prostrate condition after she has been ruined by this war. 
We need the technical knowledge of our youths in varied lines of human endeavors. 
The Quezon Memorial Foundation will finance these activities. 

It is an axiom that a country should first and foremost help herself before she can 
look up to others for extra help. This FOUNDATION is a patent proof that we are 
endeavoring our utmost to help ourselves in the lines already enumerated. We Filipinos 
should therefore contribute to this FOUNDATION, not only as a fitting expression of 
love, respect and admiration for our late leader, Manuel L. Quezon, but also as a 
demonstration of our desire to improve the service of beneficence and social welfare 
as a realization of his postulate of social justice.

the mind of the people the necessity of cultivating our agricultural lands as a 
foundation for national economic prosperity.

"INSURE HAPPINESS AND CONTENMENT FOR ALL THE 
PEOPLE UNDER THE AEGIS OF LIBERTY AND PEACE" 

As a peace-time leader, he led his people to self-restraint and self- 
discipline, to peace, prosperity and happiness. For without self-con- 
trol, "we shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roar- 
ing torrent, full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. Through self- 
discipline we shall harness all our energies, so that our power, spread- 
ing over the length and breath of this land, will develop its resources, 
advance its culture, secure social justice, give puissance to the nation, 
and insure happiness and contenment for all the people, under the aegis 
of liberty and peace. " 

The relative prosperity attained by the Philippines under his lead- 
ership was due to his statesmanship, for under his guidance the Filipino 
people engaged themselves to the great task of developing their natural 
resources. 

As a war-time leader, he put forth his utmost to insure their pro- 
tection and security — a task so stupenduous that it ultimately cost him 
his life. Let us by all means, if only to show our gratitude, contribute 
to the construction of the Quezon Memorial. 

"Through self-discipline we shall harness all oar energies, so that 
our power, spreding over the length and, breath of this kind, will dev- 
elop its resources, advance its culture, secure social justice, give puis- 
sance to the nation, and insure happiness and contentment for all the 
people, under the aegis of liberty and peace."

A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECTS, FEATURES AND SERVICES OF WHICH 
THE PROPOSED MONUMENT OR QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION SHALL CONSIST 

—THE STATUE OF PRESIDENT QUEZON — 

Efforts will be made to make his statue the natural expression of his dynamic character with 
certain reflections on Social Justice. (The engineers and artists will take care to reproduce these de- 
tails through the most brilliant execution of art, to form a combination of beauties, concentrated in a 
colossal symbol of patriotism and humanity.) 

—THE MAUSOLEUM OF PRESIDENT QUEZON— 

Perhaps the mausoleum will be a happy combination of art in an allegorical design, which will 
show a particular feature of the architectures of the nations in the course of their epochs and ccntu- 
cies — with the use of prime materials of the Philippines. (The architects and artists will have the 
final say.) 

—THE SITE OF THE MONUMENT— 
It will be in a prominent site in Quezon City. The place will be converted into a truly ideal 
park, surrounded by the wonders of nature, which will attract the continuous pilgrimage of tourists, 
specially the students. When we say "wonders of nature" it is because there will be surprises in the 
global interpretation between practical life and art, science and culture of the Philippines, virtues which 
will constitute part of the treasures of the monument. In that park the splendors of the city will 
blend with the panoramas of nature in a rural and wild atmosphere; the verdour of the park will be a 
pleasure to the eyes and will enhance the health of its inhabitants, visitors and daily guests; there in 
the midst of an enchanting scenery, the rose and the orchid will strive for supremacy in glamour, 
beauty and loveliness— no doubt the landscape experts will lay it out with such perfection as will make 
f it a real botanical garden, pleasant, beautiful and ideal

There is no doubt that it will have a good Quezonian Library of international character. The library 
will be for public use specially the scholars and the students. There are good probabilities that this

"WAR IS UNJUST AS THE DECISION OF THE SWORD DOES 
NOT NECESSARILY ACCORD WITH THE DICTATES OF CON- 
SCIENCE AND OF RIGHT/' 

President Quezon fought to regain" and maintain the freedom and 
leadership which his fathers had enjoyed before him and at what prize? 
He gave his life for this freedom and on his death bed in foreign soil 
he whispered his last wish that he might be allowed to die and lay his 
bones in the country he so well loved. 

Speaking of the war he said: "War is expensive; it has reduced 
many nations to beggary. It is foolish ; there is always a better way 
to settle any difficulty, provided that both sides are willing to substitute 
reason for hatred, prejudice and greed. It is tragic; invariably it 
creates suffering, privation and heart-break. Worst of all, it is unjust; 
the decision of the sword does not necessarily accord with the dictates 
of conscience and of right." 

His remains now rest in the soil of his birth under the tropical 
blue sky that gave him life to serve his country and mankind. 

His remains will be transferred to the Quezon Foundation and kept 
in a magnificent mauseleum that will reflect the glory of his achieve- 
ments for the welfare, freedom and independence of the Philippines. 

Let us, therefore, express our gratitude for his patriotic service by 
giving our share to the construction of the Quezon Memorial. 

"There is ahvays a better way to settle any difficulty, provided that

The Foundation will no doubt be the soul and living spirit of the Quezon Monu- < >_

appropriations of funds and property, yet the services rendered are almost imperceptible, 
although they are good enough as a means of emotional appeal for financial support.

For this reason, it is deemed proper to establish a new institution to centralize 
certain services, which only give chances to unnecessary overlapping that spoils the good 
will of the few philanthropists in the Philippines; but when we say few, we do not mean 
that many of the privileged class are indifferent towards this Christian duty; on the 
contrary, everybody knows that the sentiment of Christianity is common among the 
Filipinos but on the other hand no organization solidly established with popular support 
has had the courage to take the initiative of shouldering this mission, to stimulate those 
who are altruists and philanthropists, capable of cooperating disinterestedly with full 
devotion and for this purpose, it is planned to create the "Quezon Memorial Founda- 
tion" which will be the ideal institution to perform this great service of social justice 
within certain limits, under proper regulation. 

—A GALLERY OF FILIPINO HEROES AND MARTYRS— 

This hallowed hall will be a part of the museum and will undoubtedly attract the admiration of 
cosmopolitan people; who knows! It will be a solemn hall containing the historical figures in 
natural size (made of wax) of the Filipino heroes and martyrs who strove for justice and liberty for the 
Philippines, from Lapu-lapu, Soliman, Burgos, Bonifacio, Rizal, Mabini, Marcelo del Pilar, Luna, Gregorio 
del Pilar, to President Quezon with the other heroes of Bataan and Corregidor. 

The hall will be decorated with fine engravings of different anthropological groups of the Philip- 
pine race. 

Beautiful sarcophagi representing symbolic figures and emblems of heroism in an array of art will 
give pre-eminence to the whole in full harmony with the solemnity of the hall of the "Quezon Foun- 
dation". 

—SEEDS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE— 

Appeal must be made to public opinion that the Quezon Memorial Fund Drive 
must not be affected by party differences although we are the first to respect the prin- 
ciples and political reactions of every one, inasmuch as all have the right to freedom of 
action within our democratic set-up; we wish, however, to remind everybody that this 
noble undertaking is purely of a civic nature, its main purpose being to show the popular 
recognition and gratitude to the late President Quezon for his patriotic labors and that 
the monument to be erected in his honor will be an institution intended to promote 
national culture and works of beneficence as reminiscent of his social justice pro- 
gram to the end that those in need of relief or some help that will open to them some 
opportunity for betterment, may feel the beneficial effects of the institution. Quezon 
sowed the seeds of social justice, and so the Committee is desirous of seeing to it that the 
erection of the monument will give birth to a FOUNDATION that will continue ren- 
dering services to the people. 

It is understood that the Committee will do its best to have the FOUNDATION 
render the services mentioned, provided the goal set for in this drive will be fully covered 
to defray the cost of construction of this huge project. 

All of us, therefore, must give our contributions and ask others to help also in 
the realization of this work of national importance. 

Collect the pamphlets from I to XIII. Read them and you will find on the top of the first pages

LET US HAVE A QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION 




Charity was an inborn virtue in President Quezon. Amidst the 
cares of state, he found time to show his love to children by 
giving them of his own food, not out of pity, but in a spirit 
of Christian Chanty. 



QUEZON MEMORIAL FUND DRIVE

"CHRISTIANITY'S HIGHEST TEACHING IS TO LOVE OUR FEL- 
LOWMAN. LET US LOVE BY HELPING HIM AND HIS FAMILY 
LIVE HAPPY AND CONTENDED/' 



Charity and benevolence toward the poor and the helpless sprung 
from his heart most spontaneously. Without fanfare and publicity, 
President Quezon helped many poor students to finish their studies. 

He believed in and practised . Christian charity. He said "It is 
our boast that we are the only Christian nation in the Far East. Our 
boast would be an empty one if we do not show in actual practice that 
we are Christians. Christianity's highest teaching is to love our fel- 
lowman. Let us love by helping him and his family live happy and con- 
tented." 

He said once: "Love is manifested by the kind treatment which we 
give to our fellow-men". He inculcated in his people the productive life 
when he said: "I offer to you the useful life, devoted to self-improve- 
ment and the service of the state. It must be rooted in character, self — 
discipline and work.' It should glorify productive enterprises, a high 
sense of responsibility, and the ethical virtues. Its objectives are per- 
sonal perfection and social efficiency." (Address at the Rizal Memo- 
rial Stadium on his birthday, 1938.) 

Contribute to the Quezon Memorial that will provide scholarship, 
endowment for the good and benefit of our youth. 

"Christianity's highest teaching is to love our fellowman.. .Let us 
love by helping him and his family live happy and contented."

A BR IFF DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECTS. FEATURES AND SERVICES OF WHICH 
THE PROPOSED MONUMENT OR QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION SHALL CONSIST 

— THE STATUE OF PRESIDENT QUEZON— 

Efforts will be made to make his statue the natural expression of his dynamic character with 
certain reflections on Social Justice. (The engineers and artists will take care to reproduce these de- 
tails through the most brilliant execution of art, to form a combination of beauties, concentrated in a 
colossal symbol of patriotism and humanity.) 

—THE MAUSOLEUM OF PRESIDENT QUEZON — 
Perhaps the mausoleum will be a happy combination of art in an allegorical design, which will 
show a particular feature of the architectures of the nations in the course of their epochs and centu- 
ries — with the use of prime materials of the Philippines. (The architects and f rtists will have the 
final say.) 

50 



—THE SITE OF THE MONUMENT— 

It will be in a prominent site in Quezon City. The place will be converted into a truly ideal 
park, surrounded by the wonders of nature, which will attract the continuous pilgrimage of tourists, 
specially the students. When we say "wonders of nature" it is because there will be surprises in the 
global interpretation between practical life and art, science and culture of the Philippines, virtues which 
will constitute part of the treasures of the monument. In that park the splendors of the city will 
blend with the panoramas of nature in a rural and wild atmosphere; the verdour of the park will be a 
pleasure to the eyes and will enhance the health of its inhabitants, visitors and daily guests; there in 
the midst of an enchanting scenery, the rose and the orchid will strive for supremacy in glamour, 
beauty and loveliness — no doubt the landscape experts will lay it out with such perfection as will make 
of it a real botanical garden, pleasant, beautiful and ideal. 

— THE LIBRARY— 

There is no doubt that it will have a good Quezonian Library of international character. The library 
will be for public use specially the scholars and the students. There are good probabilities that this 
library will contain valuable materials on the level of progress in its real sense. 

—THE MUSEUM— 

Perhaps one of the best attractions of the Quezon Memorial will be a museum where there will be 
rare and historical objects to admire, relics of diverse physical expressions with their ethnological charac- 
ters, some of which will be archeological rarities, historical amulets of natives and aborigines, rare ob- 
jects of anthropology, etc. The last war nas created a very wide field where abound materials for mu- 
seum collections; beside the specific objects and personal appurtenances that have direct or indirect con- 
nection with the private and public life of President Quezon. 

—THE QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION— 

The feeling of humanity and affection towards the unfortunate is innate in al- 
truistic peoples who move with the course of civilization, and an Independent Phil- 
ippines must not only preserve its patrimony as a Christian people, but strengthen 
it, by improving its beneficent facilities, so that without resorting to means of doubt- 
ful decency, they may comfortably shoulder their duties in maintaining a good service 
for social welfare. 

The Foundation will no doubt be the soul and living spirit of the Quezon Monu- 
ment. It is proposed to establish an "Organized Beneficence/* from which the Gov- 
ernment itself will derive much benefit. It will be under the control of a board 
of trustees. All the independent countries of advanced culture and civilization main- 
tain bureaus or institutions of social security and welfare of :his nature, well ad- 
ministered. 

While the Axis countries and their allies have branded humanity as idiotism liable 
to degenerate afterwards with the instinct of destruction' of the human species and 
Christianity — President Quezon, on the other hand, proclaimed that "democracy is a 
farce without social justice," and strove to outline a policy that produced tangible 
results for the masses. 

An accredited institution like the "Quezon Memorial Foundation" would be an 
ideal organization to take charge of an "Organized Beneficence" to supplement the 
Government in the services that it has to render to the public, in this line, which is 
most indispensable for the social welfare. The Government as well as the Red Cross 
and other similar organizations would welcome the creation of another national ins- 
titution intended to help cope with the necessary work of relief that they are required 
to render to the needy. 

The lack of centralization in this line gives way to many sorts of deceits, mis- 
appropriations of funds and property, yet the services rendered are almost imperceptible, 
although they are good enough as a means of emotional appeal for financial support.

WE ARE PROUD OF MANUEL LUIS QUEZON BECAUSE HE LOVED 
HIS PEOPLE DEARLY AND HAD AN ABIDING FAITH IN THEM 



When President Quezon was met by President Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt and the members of his Cabinet at the Union Station at 
Washington, D. C. upon his arrival in 1942 or shortly after the outbreak 
of the last World War and the doors of the White House were thrown 
wide open to receive him, it was properly emphasized that it was a sig- 
nal honor being accorded by America not merely to President Quezon 
but to the Filipino people. 

What he contributed to the Allies in what proved to be a superhuman 
effort to snatch from the hands of the enemy the freedom and demo- 
cracy that were in actual peril of being lost, was a great credit not only 
to the Filipino people but also to the Malayan race, and proved to be a 
boon to every liberty-loving nation throughout the entire world and for 
all time/ 

Secretary of the Interior Jose u. Zulueta in paying a tribute to this 
Statesman of universal renown said: "A firm believer in a government 
of law instead of a government of men, he was the first Filipino leader 
to condemn favoritism and nepotism in the service of the government. 
As a consequence of his sound policies, he commanded the respect, not 
only of his friends, but also of his enemies as well. He knew the value 
of tolerance and had a high regard for the opinions of others. This was 
the secret with which he maintained the loyalty of the men around him. 

"We are all proud of Manuel Luis Quezon, not because he was never 
defeated in any election; not because he rose from a mere working stud- 
ent to tne Presidency of the Philippine Commonwealth. We are proud 
of him because he was proud of us, because under no circumstance did 
he ever admit in life that another race existed in the world that could be 
superior to the Filipino people. We are proud of him because he was 
willing to risk everything and anything he had for the principles of jus- 
tice, liberty, and equality sacred to us and our ancestors. We are proud 
of Manuel Luis Quezon because he loved his people dearly and had an 
abiding faith in them." 

We are proud of him because he was proud of us, because under no 
circumstance did he ever admit in life that another race existed in the 
world that could be superior to the Filipino people.

LET US HAVE A QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION 

It is high time that we Filipinos should have a similar foundation established for 
the same ends, not necessarily to the same extent but in a more moderate proportion 
entirely within our financial capacity. And it is but proper and fitting that this 
foundation should be named after the most distinguished son of the country whose 
patriotic services throughout his life made it possible for us to gain our freedom — 
not in the field of battle, nor through bloodshed but in the field of practical wisdom 
and dispassionate controversial discussion. A fitting memorial can be made to honor 
the memory of President Quezon whose services in the preservation of our democratic 
way of life is universally recognized with the organization of the Quezon Memorial 
Fund. 

Our definite plan is to erect a building symbolic of the nobility, achievements and 
prestige of our late President. This building will house the Quezoniana Library and 
Museum containing all mementos, souvenirs, historical or artistic objects, symbolic of 
his heroic efforts to make our country recognized and regarded as one of the inde- 
pendent countries in the world. 

As an independent nation, we cannot afford to waste human talent — the talent 
of our youths which should be devoted to help our country in her reconstruction and 
rehabilitation from her prostrate condition after she has been ruined by this war. 
We need the technical knowledge of our youths in varied lines of human endeavors. 
The Quezon Memorial Foundation will finance these activities. 

It is an axiom that a country should first and foremost help herself before she can 
look up to others for extra help. This FOUNDATION is a patent proof that we are 
endeavoring our utmost to help ourselves in the lines already enumerated. We Filipinos 
should therefore contribute to this FOUNDATION, not only as a fitting expression of 
love, respect and admiration for our late leader, Manuel L. Quezon, but also as a 
demonstration of our desire to improve the service of beneficence and social welfare 
as a realization of his postulate of social justice.

WHEREAS, the aim of creating a moral influence 
with the establishment of an institution of interna-

inspiration for the people, would be better achieved 
with the QUEZON MEDIAL FOUNDATION , for the J ate

a great leader of his people and for having partici- 
pated in important international assemblies in con- 
nection with the Inst World War II, side by side with 
the heads of State of America, England, F r ance and 
Russia; 

WHEREAS , in consideration of the fact that in 
mentioning in our appeal to the people both of Mani- 
la and the provinces that the plan of the Committee 
is to establish a true MEMORIAL FOUNDATION in honor 
of the Tate President Quezon rendering cultural and 
beneficence services to the people as a reminiscence 
of his works for "SOCIAL JUSTICE" , popular reaction 
to our drive in the form of active interest end coo- 
peration has been noted as shown by the rapidity with 
which voluntary contributions have been sent to the 
Committee when the people have been informed of the 
practical advantages that the public will receive- from 
said FOUNDATION; 

lifflERFAS, the abundance in . the United States of 
America, unlike other countries, of its Foundations 
of education, beneficence, of scientific and. relurous 
character, etc., has positively influenced m the 
formation of the nation b 1_ cha ra c t e r of the most po- 
werful country in the world, for its Altruism, Demo- 
cracy and. Humanitarian sense; 

NOW THEREFORE, the QUEZON i-EU/JLIAL CO: SOTTED,

RESOLVED: To respectfully inform His Excel-

is the sense of this Committee, for the good of 
both the contributing public and the Government 
that the future QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION must

cence and educational services to the people, im- 
mortalising a work of patriotic and charitable ' 
character in consonance with the ideology of the 
late President Quezon and his works for Social

CAMPAIGN SOUVENIRS. 
DESCRIPTION 

The PINS are a striking likeness of the late President in three kinds: 

silver plated and silver gold. . . 

The symbolic PORTRAITS in five colors show the several stages of his life. The pic- 
ture depicts his active participation in the Philippine Revolution and in chronological succession 
the indelible phases of his dynamic existence up to the last stage of his struggles for the freedom 

of the ^ ip ^^p HLETS are 3n almost exhaustive eulogy of his work in the different spheres 
of the public service and statements in abstract on his character and labors. 

These PAMPHLETS arc thirteen in number and each describes a particular achievement 
of the late President. It is illustrated with some feature that fits into the description. If the 
thirteen pamphlets are arranged in alphabetical order, the reader will find out in full a sigm- 

ficant thought. . . . , , , 

The QUEZON • MEMORIAL BOOK— This book contains a description of the posthumous 
homages rendered by the American people on the occasion of the death and funerals. of the late 
President in the United States; the receptions accorded to his remains on their way to the Phil- 
ippines, on the West Coast Cities, in Honolulu and in Manila; the necronolog.cal services held in 
Malacanan, in the Philippine Congress and in Sto. Tomas University chapel, under the sponsor- 
ship of public officials and private institutions in the Philippines, including his burial in the 

North cemetery. ... . j l l 

The Book also contains the programs of the necronological services and the brilliant ora- 
tions delivered by His Excellency, The President, the Honorable Vice-President and other dis- 
tinguished public speakers; also statements eulogizing his character and life by such personalities 
as President Roosevelt, General Mac Arthur, Justice Frank Murphy and many other leaders of 
other countries. The orations are masterpieces in this line of public speaking and they constitute 
a complete synopsis of his life, labors and public services. 

It is profusely illustrated with beautiful photographs; this edition should be the most in- 
teresting and instructive souvenir of the Quezon Memorial Fund Drive. -J 

The POSTERS consist of two different designs: (a) The People (Poster) in one and 
two colors; (b) Democracy (Poster) in one and two colors; they are allegorical of certain char- 
acteristic features of the Social Justice program of the late President Quezon. 

We call them posters because in spite of the high quality of the material of which they 
are made, the price is so cheap that they may be pasted at suitable places where there * a large 
crowd, in order that the greatest number of people may be informed of the existence of the Que- 
zon Memorial Fund Drive; but on the other hand when these posters are pasted on I ^ cardboard 
or a piece of wood, they are better preserved For a long time and they should be used " «.orate 
an office or library so that everybody who sees them may be imbued with their graphic mter- 

pretation. ^ ^ ^ ^ prese rved as part of a cultural collection for the reason 

that this national campaign is historic and they reflect certain features of the 'dcology on soc.a 
justice. The low price of these propaganda materials must not be allowed to lower the concepts 
that they represent. On account of the significance of the ideal that they portray which is 
Social Welfare, they must be appreciated.
