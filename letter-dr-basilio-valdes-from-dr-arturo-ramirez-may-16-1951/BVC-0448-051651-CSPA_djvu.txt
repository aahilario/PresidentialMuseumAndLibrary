Dear Dr. Basilio Valdes, 

I wish to extend my profound gratitude and sincerest thanks 
to you for all the help that you have afforded me during my stay 
as Extern, Junior Resident and Senior Resident Surgeon in the 
Department of Surgery of the UST Hospital, Free Clinics. The op- 
portunities that you extended to me have been very encouraging. 

Yet, in spite of this, I have been a problem student every now and 
then. I do wish, however, that whatever heart-aches I have caused, 
that they were never taken as done to offend but rather as one that 
is likely to be committed by one student who has all the intentions 
of learning as much as possible within the shortest possible time. 

Once again let me state my sincerest thanks and profoundest 
gratitude to you and to all the Staff Members of Orthopaedics; 
and, should I have the occasion to lend a helping hand in the fu- 
ture, please do not hesitate to inform me and I would always be 
willing to do something for my very kind pnd accommodating pro- 
fessor. 



Very sincerely yours,
