Qme of our chief objectives immediately after the re-establishment 
of the Commonwealth government in Manila has been and is the restoration 



within the city and its vicinity. 

At present, the United States Army medical authorities are in 
charge of public health and sanitation in Manilao The Commonwealth 
government is offering to the United States Army Medical Corps all the 



Col® Howard F® Smith $25) has been given charge of sanitation and 

public health for the entire Philippines® Col® Maurice C® Pincoffs (MC) 
has been appointed the Army City Health Officer, and as such, is in 
charge of the institution of public health measures and the adminis- 
tration of hospitals in the City of Manila and vicinity, until the 
Commonwealth* s Bureau of Health is reconstituted® 

There has been a great improvement in the sanitation and clean- 
liness of Manila since the City Health Department under the Army started 
functioning. More than 2,000 restaurants have been inspected® Garbage 
cans have been distributed all over the city and its collection and dis- 
posal are being done night and day with the help of trucks® More than 
one thousand dead bodies have been buried® There are now 43 hospitals 
functioning® In Mandaluyong, an orthopedic hospital will soon be esta=> 
blished® I am happy to report that the majority of the streets in the 
city are now clean and that so far, there has been no epidemio of any sort® 



of health facilities and services and the maintenance of good sanitation

It is regrettable to state, however, that there were recently, 

11 deaths and many cases of blindness resulting from poisoning with 
wood alcohol, illicitly manufactured by some of our greedy and unpat- 
riotic citizens » I earnestly enjoin everybody to report to the Provost 
Marshal in Bilibid Prison or to me personally, any person who is known 
to be illicitly manufacturing liquor# 

It is also gratifying for the people of Manila to know that prac- 
tically the entire north seotion of Manila and parts of Quezon City 
have running water® It is hoped that South Manila will have a resump- 
tion of its water supply in a week® 

Five markets have been opened and they are closely supervised 
by sanitary inspectors® 

The United States Army Health authorities and the Commonwealth 
government will continue in trying their best to restore to normalcy in 
as early a date as is possible with existing facilities all the esta- 
blishments essential in keeping our city clean and sanitary®
