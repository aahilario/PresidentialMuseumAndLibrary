  <description>This book honors a dedicated public servant, in the hope that his life and career will serve as an inspiration and challenge to the Jesse M. Robredos of the future. Just as the death of Ninoy Aquino inspired Jesse to enter public life, we hope that Jesse's story, and the manner in which the nation came together to pay tribute to him, will inspire future generations to pursue what has memorably come to be known as tsinelas leadership. 

The Committee on Funeral Arrangements and Burial of the late Secretary Jesse M. Robredo presents this book to the Filipino people, in fulfillment of President Benigno S. Aquino III's instructions--that the Republic should render the highest and most meaningful honors to one of its most faithful sons.

Number of pages: 141
