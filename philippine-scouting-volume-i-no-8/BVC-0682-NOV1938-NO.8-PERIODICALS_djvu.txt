■VT OT a few persons inclined to- 
- wards retrospection have re- 
marked “My! how time flies!” Not 
a few of them have noticed the 
swift advance of time, the rapid 
arrival of days and nights, the al- 
most hasty departure of month 
after month. 

Only three hundred and sixty- 
five days oi - so ago, we were cele- 
brating a significant day. The 
atmosphere bespoke something 
peaceful yet glorious, quiet yet full 
of meaning. The evenings were 
cold. In the streets, there was an 
air of festivity prevailing above 
the noisy din of usual business life. 
From windows hang beautiful, 
novel lanterns, brilliantly illumin- 
ated. It was the Christmas Sea- 
son. 

Now, we feel again the same 
peaceful yet glorious atmosphere. 
There is again that strange com- 
bination of quietude and festivity 
in our streets. Once again, the 
nights are getting cold. Once 
more, beautiful attractive lanterns 
adorn our windows. It is Christ- 
mas again. 

To Scouts, the advent of Christ- 
mas possesses a meaning double 
the usual significance which others 
attribute to it. To Scouts, Chi is - 
mas is a day not only of great ie- 
joicing over the anniversary^ 
His birth but also a day of extra- 
ordinary opportunities foi Seivice 
performed in the name of the 
Great Scoutmaster who was boi n 

"’"little 1 hearts of all Scouts re- 
sits what we call 
Spirit”, which, mingling 

“Scout Spirit”. *> e T! " atto of 
wonderful force in the inattei o 

giving Service to others. 

During Christmas mankind has 
a tradition of exchanging gilts 

and presents. Scouts exchange 
gifts also, — and give gilts to 
bthorfi— but they are not always 
material presents. Thai is wn.v 
Scouts can afford to be happy 
even if. during Christmas, they 
in i r 1 ihpmselves unable to buy what 


they want for their loved ones. 
They only have to perform 
“Christmas good turns”, and they 
are happy, — happy because of the 
Christmas spirit which dwells in 
their hearts, happy in the thought 
that on the day of His birth, they 
performed something which would 
make Him glad. 

Christmas is indeed symbolic of 
a thousand things. It is one day 
on which a great portion of the 
population of the world joins in 
a huge celebration. In the West, 
in the East, in the North, in the 
South — from far and near — come 
indications of extraordinary pre- 
parations for Christmas. 

In such a world as ours today — 
wherein disorder, bloodshed, and 
mass killings on the battlefield are 
common newspaper headlines — 
wherein the boom of cannons is 
not an unusual sound — wherein 
greed and selfishness are gradual- 
ly and constantly gaining expres- 
sion through ruthless war and 
unjust destruction — the coming of 
Christmas should have a greater 
meaning. 

Let us not forget that on the 
twenty-fifth day of December, 
many, many, years ago, the Prince 
of Peace was born in Bethlehem. 
A mock celebration of Christmas 
we would perform indeed if, on 
this day, the joyful clangs of 
church bells and chapel chimes are 
drowned out by the shots of guns 
and the roar of raiding airplanes. 
Mock Christians indeed we woul.d 
be if, on this day of the Saviour’s 
birth, the voices of the dying and 
the suffering outdo in volume the 
tunes of Christmas carols. 

It is always morbid to think of 
these things at such a time as this. 
It is not Christmas-like to ponder 
over the “darker side” of present 
day existence while everyone of us 
is expected to put on his most con- 
| aj rjnilS smile and emit his merriest 
iauW Yet, we cannot escape al- 
together the reality which stares 
a l us, and which compels us to 

•stare at U i» return. 


The most we can do, therefore, 
is to remember that we are 
Scouts. Scouts! There is magic 
in the name! Christmas for 
Scouts! There is mysterious joy 
in that phrase!! 

How fortunate are we, — mem- 
bers of the Scout Movement — 
who, in spite of all prevailing dis- 
agreements and misunderstand- 
ings, stand perfectly united, un- 
animous in creed and ideals ! How 
glorious is the Christmas which 
we share! Millions of Scouts — 
coming from different lands, ut- 
tering different tongues, dressed 
in various styles, contrasting in 
political, religious, and social be- 
liefs — and yet united and undivid- 
ed in a universal Oath to do our 
duty to God, to Country, to others, 
and to ourselves. No wonder that 
on the day of the Great Scout- 
master’s birth, we unconsciously 
consolidate our thoughts and in- 
tentions in one large lump of 
prayers and offerings to Him who 
is the source of all life. Peace 
on earth — good will to men! Thus 
has been our all-time Christmas 
slogan. Let us keep it so! There 
is great need for it today! 

As we approach the twenty-fifth 
of .December, let us unite our 
hearts and souls in prayer to the 
Great Scoutmaster : 

“Our Father in Heaven - 
Above us, we ask Thee 
For guidance in our daily 

task. 

May virtue and manhood 
Stand strongly amongst us. 
To Thee we give all of our 

thanks. 

The Scout Oath, the Scout 

Law, 

Their lessons unfolding 
To our youth, in members 

untold, 

Our Motto, our Good Turn, 
May ere live it and teach it. 
Great Spirit of SeeutMg, we 

pray.’’

1114 Qen. BASILIO J. DALDES 

Member, National Executive Board, 

Boy Scouts of the Philippines 


(nr 1 HIS month, we are glad to 

L present to you as the feature 
of our Roll-Call a distinguished 
personage in the Philippines, — 
Major-General Basilio J. Valdes, 
Deputy Chief of Staff of the Phil- 
ippine Army and prominent mem- 
ber of our National Executive 
Board. 

General Valdes is among those 
of whom our organization is very 
proud. Not only is he recognized 
as one of the highest officials of 
the Philippine Army but also as 
a surgeon of international re- 
nown. . , , 

Although General Valdes is 
better known as an Army official, 
it was not his boyhood ambition 
to become such. Medicine has al- 
ways been his chosen field of seiv- 
ice to his country. 

General Valdes was born m Ma- 
nila on July 10, 1894. His father 
is Dr. Benito Valdes y Salvador 
while his mother is Filomena Pica. 

He secured his education from 
various schools and colleges not 
only in the Philippines but also in 
foreign countries. In fact, he had 
his preliminary schooling at Bar- 
celona, Spain. He also attended 

school in Hongkong. 

After finishing his secondary 
prhiration at the Manila High 
School he enrolled in the College 
of Medicine, University of Santo 

^Immediately after graduation, 
he was appointed instructoi m 
physiology at the University of 
the Philippines. He soon discov- 
ered however, that teaching was 
too dull for him. He Kwa* ad- 
venturous spirit. H ... 

make actual use of his skill as a 
nhvsician Furthermore, he want- 

S»er service to ' h— * 

through the piactice 

16 Accordingly, to . 

1916, the young physician le 
Europe to join the French Re 
Cross. Two months latex, he was 
appointed Assistant Surgeon o 
the French Red Cross Hospital 
No. 101, under Captain Cotte, 
now professor of Gynecology , 
University of Lyons. 


It did not take long for General 
Valdes’ superiors to realize the 
possibilities that resided in the 
person of the young surgeon who 
had just arrived from the Philip- 
pines. His services were out- 
standing and the French were 
not slow to recognize them. In 
July of the following year, he was 
appointed a Captain in the Amer- 



CPaj. Gen. ‘Basilio J. Ualdes 


ican Red Cross and was assigned 
to Military Hospital V. R. 76 as 
Assistant to Colonel William L. 
Keller, U. S. Army Medical Corps. 

General Valdes’ capability in 
his chosen line of work continued 
to manifest itself as the months 
rolled on. In June, 1918, he was 
made Chief Surgeon of the Mili- 
tary Hospital of Arc-En-Bari’ois, 
Haute Marne. In February, 1919, 
he was appointed member of the 
Inter-Allied Commission to Ger- 
many and served in various capa- 
cities until July of the same year, 
when he was promoted to Major 
and Deputy Commissioner, Amer- 
ican Red Cross. His rapid ad- 
vancement did not stop. A month 
later he was made Chief of the 
Medical service of the Red Cross 
Commission to Albania. 


It was here that illness sud- 
denly overtook the promising sur- 
geon, which necessitated his de- 
parture from New York and later, 
his return to the Philippines. His 
illness, however, served as the 
turning point of his military 
career in the Philippines. 

On June 6th, 1921, he was ap- 
pointed first lieutenant and Me- 
dical Inspector of the Philippine 
Constabulary. In March of the 
following year, he was promoted 
to the rank of Captain and Sur- 
geon; and in November, 1925, he 
was made Major in the Philippine 
Constabulary. Three months af- 
ter his appointment as Major, he 
was promoted to the rank of 
Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief Sur- 
geon of the Philippine Constab- 
ulary. This was on February 4, 
1936. Two months later, he was 
elected President of the Board of 
Medical Examiners of the Philip- 
pines. 

The same continuous promotion 
which characterized General Val- 
des’ career in Eui'ope is notice- 
able in his career in the Philip- 
pines, — a very eloquent testimony 
to the truth of the saying, “You 
can’t keep a good man down.” 

On January 25, 1933, he was 
appointed acting Commissioner of 
Health and Welfare of the Philip- 
pine Government. On May 1st of 
the following year, he was pro- 
moted to Brigadier-General and 
Chief of the Constabulary Divi- 
sion. Upon the organization of 
the Philippine Army on January 
11, 1936, he received appointment 
as Brigadier-General and First 
Assistant Chief of Staff. Five 
months later, he was promoted to 
the rank of Major-General, with 
the designation as Deputy Chief 
of Staff, Philippine Army. 

When the Philippine Constab- 
ulary was recreated recently by 
Commonwealth Act No. 343, Ma- 
jor-General Valdes was appointed 
Acting Chief of the Constabulary. 

There can be no doubt that with 
this amazing rat.e of promotion 
that has featured the career of

CHARACTER VALUES OF SCOUTING 


W HEN His Excellency, the 
President of the Philippines, 
made his memorable birthday 
speech at the Rizal Memorial Sta- 
dium last August, he rendered the 
country another signal service by 
calling the attention of our people 
to a fundamental need, that of 
strengthening the character of our 
citizenry. This is admittedly a 
difficult task, one that requires 
the unstinted support and the act- 
ive cooperation of the home, the 
church, the school, and the commu- 
nity. At the same time, it is a 
task which must be done, and done 
well if we are to survive as a na- 
tion, for in the final analysis the 
surest guarantee of our national 
security is individual integrity and 
strength of character in our citi- 


zens. 

The Boy Scouts of the Philip- 
pines is essentially an organiza- 
tion for character building. Its 
objectives as well as its program 
of activities are intended primari- 
ly to develop in the growing boy 
greater and greater powers of ad- 
justment to and control over the 
physical and social forces that im- 
pinge upon his unfolding peisonal- 
ity. It supplements in a truly ef- 
fective way the training provided 
by the curriculum of the school. 
Step by step, as tne Scout works 
his way up from Tenderfoot to 
Eagle Scout, he develops useful 
habits and skills and desirable at- 
titudes which, if made permanent 
and reenforced by other educative 
influences, are bound to become 
an integral part of his moral 

Before being admitted into the 
organization, the Boy Scout has to 
take an Oath whereby he proiMses 
three things; namely, (1) to do 
his duty to God and his country 
and to obey the Scout L^w. (2) 
to help other people at j 1 ; 
(3) to keep himself physical^ 
strong, mentally awake, ^ ant m - 
rallv straight. If every Scou 
makes an earnest effort to J'Yj ^ 
Oath, as he is expected to do, tha t 
can be no cause for worry <vs to 
the type of man he will become. 

What is the Scout Law which 
every boy binds himself to ob- 
serve? As every Boy Scout 01 
Scoutmaster knows, it is an enu- 
meration of the desirable traits 
which the Scout is expected to de-

•I* '»* 


velop. According to this Law, a 
Scout is trustworthy, loyal, help- 
ful, friendly, courteous, kind obe- 
dient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, 
clean, and reverent. Here we- 
have a comprehensive list of traits 
for a well-rounded program of 
character education. Every Scout 
is supposed to learn these traits 
by heart and to understand their 
meaning fully. And what is far 
more important, he has to live 
them. Nor is that all, for hand in 
hand with the development of hab- 
its goes the development of right 
attitudes, which are of great im- 
portance in character formation. 

There are three features of 
Scouting which to my mind are 
worth pointing out. The first is 
the timeliness of its program of 
activities. To put it figuratively, 
Scouting strikes while the iron is 
hot. It takes cognizance of the 
characteristics and needs of the 
adolescent boy and provides him 
with a series of activities suited to 
these needs. For instance, since 
the herding tendency, otherwise 
known as gregariousness, mani- 
fests itself strongly at this period, 
Scouting provides opportunities 


* 



DR. CECILIO PUTONG 



for the proper expression of this 
natural tendency through the pa- 
trol and the troop activities. As 
a result of these group activities, 
loyalty to the troop and to the or- 
ganization is developed. In the 
same way, the natural love of boys 
for outdoor life is amply provided 
for by the hikes and the camping 
activities. The protective tenden- 
cy, which also grows in strength 
at this period, is given expression 
in connection with that part of 
the Law relating to kindness 
which is explained as friendliness 
to animals and a desire to save and 
and protect all harmless life. Need- 
less to say, Scouting 'offers unlim- 
ited opportunities for the satis- 
faction of the boy’s curiousity, 
another strong tendency in the 
adolescent. The desire for play 
is likewise gratified in the many 
games and songs that are usually 
given a place in every meeting of 
the troop. Thus it can be seen 
that the Boy Scout program is 
based upon sound psychological 
principles. 

Another important feature is 
the emphasis on doing. The 
Scout learns b} r actual practice. 
He learns to be helpful by actual- 
ly helping — taking an old woman 
across a busy street, saving a 
child from a furious dog, showing 
the way to a lost stranger, and 
the like. During the Carnival 
season our Boy Scouts do many a 
good turn by looking for stray 
children and taking care of them 
until their parents call for them. 
We have known of actual cases 
of Boy Scouts who have even risk- 
ed their lives in order to do a good 
deed. One Scout, for instance, 
saved his father’s life by swim- 
ming one and one-half miles to get 
help; another rescued a man who 
was drowning in a river; and still 
another not long ago rescued an 
unconscious woman from a burn- 
ing firecracker factory. These 
Scouts were heroes in every sense 
of the word. In this respect of 
integrating discussion with activi- 
ty, word with action, and learning 
with doing, Scouting is superior 
to what can ordinarily be done in 
the average classroom. While our 
teachers believe in the- idea, they 
are often helpless in the face of 
the very limited opportunities for

*T* HE period between October 
31st and November 15th, 
1938, has gone and is now defi- 
nitely a part of history. I write 
this “bi'ief review” partly to keep 
a record of general facts connect- 
ed with th.e events which happen- 
ed between those dates, and partly 
to render a report to the Scouting 
field of what we accomplished in 
the way of celebrating the second 
anniversary of the approval of 
Commonwealth Act 111. 

Parenthetically, as Chairman 
of the National Committee on 
our Anniversary Period celebra- 
tion, I wish, first of all, to make 
public my sincere gratitude to all 
who have contributed to the suc- 
cess of our Anniversary celebra- 
tion, particularly to the members 
of the Committee, who worked 
earnestly and at great sacrifice of 
time and effort. 

This being done away with, 
I should like to proceed with a 
dispassionate and impartial re- 
view of our Anniversary Period, 
so that from it we may gain in- 
spiration and enthusiasm with 
which to go into our celebration

I believe that for the purpose 
of making out a comprehensive 
report, the organization of the 
National Committee on Anniver- 
sary Period celebration can be 
utilized as an outline. 

The National Committee was 
composed of six members, includ- 
ing Chief Scout Executive Villa- 
corta, who rendered very laud- 
able services as Executive Secre- 
tary of the Committee. Each 
member of the Committee was in 
turn appointed chairman of dif- 
ferent sub-committees which were 
created in order to achieve great- 
er results thru organized division 
of labor. These committees were or th 0 rv>

BRIEF REVIEW 

By Hon. Manuel Camus 


National Scout Commissioner and Chairman , 
National Committee , Anniversary 
Period 'Celebration 






by lack of previous experience in 
anniversary celebrations, we can 
gain an idea of the vast amount 
of work that our Committee on 
Activities had to perform. 

1 shall not give a detailed ac- 
count of each activity that we con- 
ducted during the Period but I 
shall mention a few of those which

Scouters in the 
Philippines to 
join in a natin- 
• al re-dedication 
to the Scout Oath and Law, led 
by Mr. Villacorta. 

Special mention must be made 
also of the Manila celebration of 
“Scouts’ Day in Church”, which 
was featured by separate religious 
services for Boy Scouts of dif- 
ferent faiths. The Catholic Boy 
Scouts were given opportunity to 
attend a field mass at the San 
Marcelino Grounds. Scouts be- 
longing to the Protestant faith 
attended a special service at the 
Central Student Church. Boy 
Scouts who belong to the Philip- 
pine Independent Church were 
also given a chance to assemble 
and attend in one large group a 
service specially celebrated for 
them at their own Cathedral. 

The following day, a conference 
of all Scout Leaders in Manila and 
the neighboring provinces was

larga, and Exequiel Villacorta. 


Scolds demonstrating First Aid at a local drug store 
I believe merit our commendation 
and applause. 

Foremost of these, of course, 
was the huge Torch Parade uhich 

Scouts and Scout Leaders in 
Manila and the neighboring tow n 
staged in the evening ot Uctoo . 

31st. This parade was featured 
prominently in local newspapeis 
before the event and all expecta- 
tions were found to be fulfilled. 

As most Scouters know also, we 
succeeded in our plans to have a 
national hook-up that evening in 
order to enable all Boy Scouts and 


held at the School of Hygiene and 
Public Health. Several distin- 
guished Scouters were invited to 
speak during the conference, and 
all those who attended testified 
afterwards to its success. I must 
not omit mention of the fact that 
among those in attendance were 
Scouters coming from as far as 
Pampanga, Bulacan, and Nueva 
Ecija. Of course there was a 
good-sized delegation from Rizal. 

Another big day in our Anni- 
versary was November 10th, de- 
signated “Good Turn Day”. On 
this day Scouts went on duty at 
all Puericulture Centers and hos- 
pitals. They also served as school- 
boy safety patrols in their respec- 
tive schools. Some troops went 
on house-to-house visits in their 
communities, collecting old toys 
and worn-out clothing, which they 
are at present repairing, to be 
distributed during Christina* 
among the poor. 

Two days after “Good Turn 
Day” came another day of extra- 
ordinary activity for Scouts. This 
was “Be Prepared Day”, which 
was celebrated all over the Ar- 
chipelago with rallies and field 
meets. District Scout Commis- 
sioners showed splendid executive 
ability by organizing rallies and 
field competitions within their 
own districts. I should say that 
on this day, the public really re- 
ceived a treat regarding what Boy 
Scouts mean by saying that they 
are always “Prepared”.

BELLOW Scouters and Scouts: 
A Ladies and Gentlemen: 
Friends of the Boy Scouts 
of the Philippines: 

We are indebted this evening to 
the Manager of Station KZEG, for 
having donated this period to uj, 
to Dy Buncio and Company, for 
sponsoring this broadcast over 
Station KZIB, and to Muller and 
Phipps Ltd., agents for tire well- 
known Kolynos toothpaste, and to 
the Manila Motor Company, who 
are sponsoring this program over 
Station KZRM. The combined co- 
operation of these different com- 
panies is making possible this na- 
tional hook-up by remote control. 
May we hope to prove ourselves 
worthy of their generosity and 
good will! 

The occasion which has called 
us together tonight, as you un- 
doubtedly know, is the second an- 
niversary of the approval of Com- 
monwealth Act 111, which char- 
tered the Boy Scouts of the Phil- 
ippines. It is a grand and signi- 
ficant occasion, and it aooeprs 
more so as I gaze around me this 
evening dazzled by hundreds of 
blazing torches and brilliant beau- 
tiful lanterns. Never have I seen 
so glorious an occasion so glorious-

because you are here with me to 
share these rare delights. 

But let not this day be simply 
a day of celebration and rejoicing, 
nor merely a day of self-recogni- 
tion. Let us make it a day trib- 
ute and gratitude too. Let us, 
this evening, pay tribute and grant 
recognition to those who have 
worked hardest in our behalf, who 
have unselfishly toiled in behalf of 
Filipino Youth. ' 

We would be extremely ungrate- 
ful indeed, if, after having achiev- 
ed our present state of progress 
and achievement, we deliberately 
disregard what that great organ- 
ization — the Boy Scouts of Amer- 
ica — has done for us. We would 
be extremely ungrateful indeed, if, 
in this hour of recollection over 
the triumphs we have attained, we 
lose memory or omit mention of 
what the Boy Scouts of America 
has accomplished in the Philip- 
pines. 

Let us give tribute to the Boy 
Scouts of America, my friends — 
tribute to that magnificent host 
of noble American Scouters who 
compose the National Staff of 
the Boy^ Scouts of America, 
to Dr. James E. West, their 
beloved Chief Scout Executive, to 
Mr. Walter W. Head, their distin- 
guished President, to the capable 
directors of their various divisions 
and services, and most important 
of all, to one of their best Scout 
Executives, Major Ernest E. Voss, 
w ,-° w orked side by side with us, 
who suffered and sweat in the fir- 
ing !; ne amongst us, whose memo-

a lasting resident in our hearts, let 


Well, the reason is simple and 
not difficult to comprehend. In 
including among our National By- 
Laws ?, provision setting aside the 
period from October 31st to Nov- 
ember 15th as Anniversary Per- 
iod, the National Executive Board 
of our Organization took into con- 
sideration the fact that on Novem- 
ber 15th, we shall celebrate the 
Anniversary of the Common- 
wealth, and that by extending our 
celebration to our Commonwealth 
Anniversary, we shall be able to 
bring more clearly to you— espe- 
dally to the public — the important 
relation between Scouting and the 
Commonwealth— for such a rela- 
tion exists indeed. 

In the Scout Oath — which we 
repeated after Chief Scout Execu- 
tive Exequiel Villacorta a few min- 
l ! t( f ago— we vowed to do our 
c.uty to God and our Country. In 
oiu Scout Law, we are taught 
Loyalty to the Fatherland. In 
adopting Service as the Scout 
watch-word, service to Country is 
emphasized. 

if 01 ! 3 °? this great Common- 
wealth of ours, we have a common 
P Gr t 01 'm. And I am cer- 
L ^ that we shall gain inspiration 
m the perxormance of that Duty 
by tnus mingling together on such 
a magnificent evening as this, with 
nothing but mutual friendship and 
contagious good will in our hearts. 
Seated around this luminous camp- 
in c, we are comrades in a common 
adventure, sharing a common 
xaith, seeing a common dream. 

A greater Commonwealth — a 
fairer Filipinas — that is the vision 
which unfolds before us tonight!

PHILIPPINE SCOUTING 



AND SCOUTS 


Presidential Speech 

Delivered on Foundation Day, October 31st, 

From Malacanan Palace, 

By His Excellency, the President of the Philippines 


F* ELLOW Scouters and Scouts : 
I am happy to address you 
on this second anniversary of your 
Commonwealth Charter, and to 
extend to the National Executive 
Board of the Boy Scouts of the 
Philippines my warmest felicita- 
tions for the progress they have 
attained during the last two years. 
More than 30,000 members are 
now on your rolls. That is indeed 
a splendid achievement, giving as- 
surance that the world-wide move- 
ment devoted to the promotion of 
the ideals of peace, democracy, and 
sturdy manhood will grow and 
flourish in the Philippines. 


As the twig bends, so will the 
tree grow. This old adage, so true 
in plant life, is equally true among 
human beings. The moulding ol 
character, the formation of ideals 
and ambitions, the building up of 
physical prowess — all these must 
take place during the years ot 
early youth. It is during that 
stage when man is in a sort oi 
plastic state that his growth and 
development assumes definite di- 
rection. Many of the decisive in- 
fluences cannot be imparted eithei 
in the school or in the home. 
Wholesome contact with natiu e, 
the freedom of the outdoors, grap- 
pling- with practical obstacles and 
problems— these and these alone 
can give a young man an °PP°“ l ‘ 
nity to discover his moral, menta 
and physical resources, anc ,. 

to comprehend the necessi y 
their development in order bettei 
to meet these problems. , 

great objective of the Boy Scout 
organization to give to the 
this training in the practical ap- 
plication of their capability . 

A Boy Scout is taught to be self- 
reliant. That means that he must 
endeavor to possess both P > ‘ 

and moral courage. It ineal ,\ < 
he will not be afraid to meet beast 
or man on an equal footing, 
cause he has developed adequately 
his skill and brawn. It likewise 
means that he shall have courage 
to do what is right, for the sake oi 
rights itself, irrespective of the 
consequences either to his lire or 
fortune. 



His Excellency , President Manuel L. Quezon, broadcasting his 
speech from Malacanan on October 31st, Foundation Day . 


A . Boy Scout is taught to be a 
lover of nature. He is trained to 
learn the value of trees and birds, 
to know the use of the rippling 
brook, and to gaze with intelligent 
eyes at all forms of life. A good 
Scout knows how to wade a 
stream, to open a river or scale a 
peak. A lay in the woods reveals 
to him the great adventure of util- 
izing nature to serve man’s pur- 
poses. He learns to work with his 
hands and to find joy in strenuous 
efforts to solve difficulties provid- 
ed by his environment. 

A Boy Scout learns to be kind 
and charitable. He learns to ban- 
dage the wounded limb of a fallen 
comrade and to protect a bird or 
a harmless insect in misery. He 
helps an aged man on his feet or 
takes a wandering child into 
safety. He is taught to do good 
deeds for the beauty of them and 
because they make him happy. 

Above all a Boy Scout is trained 
to develop the principal faculties 
which make up his character. He 
is courteous, truthful, reliable, 
honest, generous, and chivalrous. 
In one' word, he is taught to be a 
strong, useful and good man. He 
learns to grow like a molave on 
the hillside and not like a plant in 
the hot house. 


Any organization with these 
great objectives deserves the sup- 
port of everyone. 1 trust that the 
Boy Scouts of the Philippines will 
enjoy that support from all public- 
spirited citizens. No other move- 
ment can give greater or more 
precious dividends to our Com- 
monwealth than this effort to 
build up the character and man- 
hood of our citizenry. 

Boy Scouts of the Philippines, 
you enjoy a priceless opportunity 
for valuable moral and physical 
improvement. I hope you will 
avail yourselves in full measure of 
that opportunity. Your lofty ideals 
are embodied in the Scout Oath 
and Law. I urge upon you to 
strengthen your faith in those, 
ideals and to prepare yourselves as 
. well as you can to take part in 

: their accomplishment. 

1 The greatest need of our coun- 
try today is a citizenry composed 
of strong, clean, earnest and so- 
cially efficient men. You are being 
trained to be such men. You will 
be the men who will provide our 
country with the kind of leader- 
ship that it needs and without 
which it cannot endure. There 
should be more of you. Ask your 
friends to join your organization.

That First Evening 

(Continued from page eleven) 

wherever they went — presenting, 
in- all, a glamorous display of 
Youth on the march, holders of 
torches symbolic Of Truth and 
Knowledge, the ideals of Scouting. 

At seven o’clock, the Sunken 
Gardens presented a magnificent 
vista heretofore unseen in Manila. 
A huge campfire was roaring away 
in mighty howls. Around it were 
seated more than two thousand 
Boy Scouts and Cubs from all over 
the capital and its environs. 

It was indeed most Unfortunate 
that His Excellency, President 
Manuel L. Quezon, could not come 
to deliver his speech from the seat 
of ceremonies. We had to be con- 
tent, therefore, — and we were 
very much delighted nevertheless 
— to hear His Excellency* address 
the Scouting field from Malacanan. 

Our celebration was also enliv- 
ened by the attendance of the Phil- 
ippine Military Band, which play- 
ed for us the Anniversary Song 
composed by Lt. A. Buenaventura 
of the Univeiseity of the Philippi- 
nes. The words of this song were 
written by our Managing Editor, 
Ricardo R. de la Cruz. 

A very significant feature of our 
program was the national rededi- 
cation to the Scout Oath and Law, 
which took place shortly before 
the conclusion of the program. The 
fact that our half-hour campfire 
qeremony was broadcast over 
three stations by remote control, 
and reached practically every por- 
tion of the Archipelago, facilitated 
the national rededication we were 
anxious to have. We are grateful 
to all concerned for thus having 
successfully enabled all Scouters 
and Scouts who could afford to 
listen, to join that mass recommit- 
tement to our highest ideals. 

It was most regrettable that 
ram should come before we could 
complete our program, but we are 
gratelu], at all events, for the fact 
that it rained after all important 
numbers had been rendered. 

Now. th'd first evening is but a 
memory. But it should not be one 
of those memories which we cher- 
ish simply tor their sheer beauty, 
it is a beautiful memory with a 
significant meaning. It should have 
impressed us that every Boy Scout 
and Scooter the world over is com- 
mitted the same obligation “to do 
our duty to God and our Country, 
and to obey the Scout Law, to help

Committee on Invitations. If 
ever we secured a large attend- 
ance at our activities, we owe it 
greatly to our Committee on In- 
vitations, which circularized news 
of our forthcoming affairs, par- 
ticularly during “Scouts’ Day in 
Church” and “Laymen’s Day”. 

Our activities were attended 
not only by Scouters and Scouts, 
but by interested laymen as well. 

And so it is that we find how 
the cheerful cooperation of each 
and every member of a certain 
corporation can contribute to- 
wards the glory of the whole 
group. One more irrefutable 
testimony to the indispensabilrty 
of Cooperation! 

In conclusion, I should like to 
commend the capable chairmen of 
the following special days in our 
Anniversary Period calendar, 
who worked hardest for united 
success :

such integration. 

A third feature of Scouting is 
the self-motivating nature of the 
activities or projects that would 
entitle a Scout to a merit badge. A 
varied list of projects is given and 
the Scout chooses the ones that ap- 
peal to him. He undertakes the 
projects himself. He virtually 
works under his own steam. There 
is no authority imposed from the 
outside. The discipline thus deve- 
loped is self-imposed, just the type 
of discipline necessary in a demo- 
cratic form of government such as 
that which we have adopted in 
this country. 

There are other excellent fea- 
tures of Scouting which we shall 
not take the time to discuss. 
Among these are the absence of 
unwholesome competition, the pro- 
vision for a great deal of physical 
activity, and the many opportuni- 
ties afforded the boy for close con- 
tact with nature. Its greatest 
value, however, is in the matter of 
citizenship training. As Dean 
James E. Russell of Teachers Col- 
p°l. u mbia University, has put. 
it, Scouting has “marvelous poten- 
cy for converting the restless, ir- 
responsible, self-centered boy into 
the straight-forward, dependable 
helpful young citizen.” There is, 
therefore, every reason why we 
should be grateful for the found- 
ing of the Boy Scouts of the Phil- 
ippines as an independent national 
organization. May it enjoy a 
healthy growth so that it will be 
able to fulfill its mission of deve- 
loping our boys into citizens with 
strong bodies, vigorous minds, and 
stout hearts!

YOU and YOUR TROOP 


By “S. M.” 


communiTij qooo turds 





■pi VERY boy who comes into my 
Troop, when he takes his 
Oath and Law examination for 
Tenderfoot Rank, is asked this 
question : “How can you do your 
duty to your country?” 

Invariably, we hear the boy 
proudly declaiming a resolve to go 
to the battlefield and fight for his 
Filipinas. That is about the most 
common concept that boys have 
about “duty to Country". In the 
Scout Oath, he promises to do his 
best to do his duty to his Country. 
And his idea is usually a “tragic 

one. A , 

Scouting, however, teaches a 
boy a better way to render service 
to the Fatherland. The Scout does 
a good turn daily, and each good 
turn is a grain of service to the 
Country. That is a point of inspi- 
ration that should be impressed 
deeply upon the mind of t 
young Tenderfoot who comes 
bustling into the Troop with a 
bundle of enthusiasm. It rectifies 
his mistaken idea about seivi 
country, and clarifies hg own 
ideals. Instead of ‘ dying ,, 
country, he strives to live c 
strong, so that he can 
most value to his cmin y • 
That ia the Scouting idea of ser- 
vice to country. . . 

Sometimes, it takes a lot of ef 
fort on the part of Soou 
before boys fully understand the 
value of Good Turns an 
actual benefits derived by 
munity from their acts. Troop 
good turns are useful n £> 
the desired results. ^ towns 

"Bucket Brigades M 
in the Philippics do not 
apparatus, and those i , 

occasionally occur are put out P> 


the citizens themselves, 
aided by the town police. 

In some instances, when 
the fires become very 
large, they are uncon- 
trollable. They stop 
only when nothing else 
remains to be burned. 

And by the time they 
stop, much property has 
been destroyed. 

Boy Scouts are in ex- 
cellent position to help 
in fighting conflagra- 
tions. As a matter of 
fact, most of them do. 

However, some system 
is needed by which these 
boys can be properly 
and promptly mobilized 
in times of distress, and 
efficiently utilized in the 
actual work of putting 
out fires and controlling 
crowds. 

A few Troops organ- 
ize “Bucket Brigades”, 
which are regularly 
drilled for service in 
cases of fire. Forma- 
tions are studied, and 
the actual passing of 
the bucket from hand 
to hand is constantly 
practised so as to insure 
swift action during fires. 

This is a Community 
Good Turn, the value of 
which is incalculable. 
Scoutmasters should 
confer with town officials, and I 
am sure that they will be only too 
glad to avail themselves of the Boy 
Scouts’ help during such catastro- 
phes. 

Typhoon Service. The typhoon 
is another common enemy of the 


Philippines. Seldom does a year 
pass without four or five typhoons 
in its list of disasters. 

Again, the courage and re- 
sourcefulness of Scouts are put to 
a test. Here is one instance when 
the individual initiative of the boy 
is combined with that of others, 
and capitalized upon magnificent- 
ly to produce a splendid whole. 

Typhoon “relief patrols” should 
exist in every Boy Scout Troop. 
Capable boys should be selected to 
compose these groups, because 
they will tackle danger, and some- 
times, even Death. Going around 
in bancas, looking for dead bodies 
and missing relatives, is no easy 
job! 

Schoolboy Safety I’atrols. This

McKinley Boy Scouts 

T noontime last November 
** 11th, a group of sweating 
Boy Scouts arrived at the Nation- 
al Office, carrying several bundles 
and boxes containing old toys and 
worn-out clothing. 

They represented the “good 
turn” of McKinley Boy Scouts in 
celebration of GOOD TURN DAY 
last November 10th. 

The toys and clothes have been 
turned over to the Associated 
Charities, and will be distributed 
during Christmas among the poor. 

The boys who actively partici- 
pated in the Good Turn were: J. 
Abara, F. Abara, P. Samson, and 
C. Reyes. They were led by Exe- 
quiel Gonzales, Scoutmaster of 
Troop 28. 


Coron Activities 

TlfTITH firm belief in the princi- 
pie that careful planning is 
productive of good results, Scout- 
master Manuel Ventura of Troop 
265, of the Coron Central School, 
Coron, Palawan, submits a sched- 
ule of activities which he intends 
to carry out in his Troop pro- 
gram, from October, 1938, to Oct- 
ober, 1939. 

Going over the schedule, we 
note some splendid evidences of 
keen foresight. All special days 
and holidays in the school calen- 
dar are properly cared for. 

All that needs to be done now 
is to prepare for their faithful 
execution of these plans. Using 
as a basis the successful celebra- 
tion of Anniversary Period which 
Coron Boy Scouts achieved re- 
cently, we are all optimistic over 
the realization of their dreams. 

Malasiqui Celebrates 

NE of the towns which report- 
^ ed early on their Anniversa- 
ry Period celebration is Malasi- 
qui, Pangasinan, where members 
of Troops 698 and 839 joined 
forces to stage a colorful celebra- 
tion of Foundation Day, October 
31st. 

A Scout program was held in 
the Malasiqui Central School in 
the afternoon, followed immed- 
iately by a Torch Parade. The 
Parade ended at seven o’clock at 
the town plaza, where a campfire 
program was held till nine o’clock.

NOVEMBER, 1938 


XRT EILE signing his name in 
"* the roster of those who at- 
tended the Scouters’ Conference 
which featured SCOUTERS’ DAY 
last November 7th, our Editor 
noticed the name of Eleuterio Ta- 
buno, from Cabanatuan, Nueva 
Ecija. Coming from such a place 
— quite a distance from Manila — 
Mr. Tabuno’s name naturally 
would attract attention. 

Accordingly, he was hunted up 
from among the group. Result: 
A very pleasant chat! 

Mr. Tabuno happened to have 
in his pocket a copy of their An- 
niversary Period program. An 
examination of the same Tevealed 
that Cabanatuan Scouters are by 
no means behind the times. They, 
too, had activities conducted dur- 
ing the special days of the Period. 

In addition, they inserted 
‘‘‘CHILDREN’S DAY”, (featured 
by good turns to little brothers 
and sisters) and “OLD PEOPLE’S 
DAY”, (celebrated with extraor- 
dinary acts of service towards the 
aged.) 

They also had a well-prepared 
p r 0 g r a m of activities for 
“SCOUTS’ DAY IN CHURCH.” 

Mr. Tabuno, by the way, is a 
mild, nice-mannered gentleman, 
every inch a Scout. He is Assist- 
ant Provincial Scout Commission- 
er for Nueva Ecija. 


PET SHOW

^ composed an amazed and ad- 
miring audience at the celebration 
of “Kindness to Animals Day” 
last October 6th by Boy Scouts of 
Troop 497, under the leadership 
of Scoutmaster Macario Esmas. 

The celebration was featured 
by a “Pet Show”, which drew 
much applause and favorable com- 
ments from the spectators in view 
of its novelty. Each Patrol spon- 
sored a pet in a general contest. 
The Dove Patrol was found to be 
the owner of “the most well- 
cared-for and best-trained dog” 
in the Troop; while the “Calaw” 
Patrol was the recipient of a 
prize for the “most-well-cared-for 

cat”. 

In addition to the Pet Show, 
the Boy Scouts also contributed a

Agusan Council Meets 

A S we recognize our responsib-

hand, do a good turn to our boys?” 
“Yes”. 

The above dialogue constituted 
a very significant phase of Scout- 
ing history in Agusan. The ques- 
tion was asked by none other than 
Agustin Pafiares, live-wire Com- 
missioner for the Public Schools 
of that province. The answer, — 
in a booming chorus — was sup-

of those cherished moments of 
Scout companionship.

of boys in that Troop. The Troop 
which had the highest advance-

PHILIPPINE SCOUTING 


AND SCOUTS 


SCOOTING IN THE SAN LAZARO HOSPITAL 

(Delivered over the radio last May by Dr. Felix Velasco , Chairman of Troop 181 , sponsored by the San Lazaro Hospital, Manila) 


¥ AD1ES and gentlemen of 
the Radio Audience: 

From a personal stand- 
point I am indeed very grate- 
ful to KZRM for so kindly 
allocating an hour for broad- 
cast to the leper boys and 
girls, Boy Scouts and Camp 
Fire Girls, in the Leprosy 
Department of the San La- 
zaro Hospital. 

As one who has worked 
among lepers for the past 
sixteen years, I am fully 
awaer of the fact that a 
handicap to the maintenance 
of orderly routine and the 
proper cooperation of the pa- 
tients in our leprosy institu- 
tions — very essential for the 
success of the treatment be- 
ing given them and for 
their general well being, — is 
the inadequate provision of 
healthy, sane and properly 
regulated entertainment that will 
make them feel more like at home 
during their enforced confinement. 

This is especially true for the 
leper patients in San Lazaro Hos- 
pital, where, due to lack of oppor- 
greatly increased number ot pa- 
tients, they could not pick up and 
pursue their ordinary occupations 
as they did while residing m then 
respective homes. 

Efforts have been, and are, be- 
ing- exerted to ameliorate tms 
phase of segregation within t 
tunities, limited space, and 
hospitals and stations, and < > 
help or assistance extended y 
private institutions, organizations, 
and persons philantropical y - 
dined for the betterment ot these

as in other progressive countries, 
to build mentally, morally, and 
physically strong and vigorous 
self-reliant citizens and citizen- 
ship. 

We are all of us cognizant of 
their aims and purposes as well as 
well as their many achievements, 
however, while I may not be in a 
position to speak for other leprosy 
institutions, I should like, at this 
time, to say a few words regard- 
ing their membership in the San 
Lazaro Hospital. 

There are at present twenty-six 
Camp Fire Girls and forty-two 
Boy Scouts in this Leprosarium. 
And with rare exceptions, these 
two groups, besides maintaining 
a general conduct worthy of emu- 


dined for the betterment o lation by the other patients, have 

poor and unfortunates, wii always willingly and voluntarily 

a tendency to make then cooperated with those in charge of 

much more pleasant ana ^he institution in sundried and 


more bearable. T . n 

Due to the efforts of Ml. 

Hart, a sincere and truste . 

of all boys and girls

They have helped in giving en-

al to existing rules and 
regulations. True it is that 
once in a while a certain 
member may commit an act 
or acts to the contrary, but 
such cases are extremely rare 
compared to other groups of 
patients not within these two 
organizations. 

What is especially vexing 
irr the care of young people 
of both sexes confined to- 
gether in an institution of 
limited space like the San 
Lazaro Hospital is keeping 
and protecting their moral 
' well-being and leading them 
in their formative years 
towards proper character 
building. These essentials are 
especially important inas- 
much as these young people 
have been removed from 
healthful influences of par- 
ents and home and some- 
thing has to be done for their 
proper upbringing. Therefore 
those in chrage of them, the school 
which we maintain as a branch of 
the City Schools, inside the hos- 
pital, and organizations such as 
the Boy Scouts and the Camp 
Fire Girls are doing all that lies 
in their power to supply these 
needs. 

That we are succeeding in our 
effotrs is amply manifested by the 
record shown by the -young girls 
and boys in this institution. And 
it goes without saying that such 
record, as shown by these two en- 
tities within this hospital is large- 
ly due to a great extent as a direct 
result of their training as mem- 
bers, and the efficiency of their 
organizations. That makes them 
worthy of the exaltations and ex- 
pectations of their many friends 
that on various occasions and in 
multitudinous ways have extended 
to them a helping hand. I sin- 
cerely hope that they will continue 
in the future, as they always have 
in the past, to be worthy recipients 
of whatever help that might be 
spared to them, by those of us 
who are in more fortunate cir- 
cumstances and are in a position 
to aid and assist their less for- 
tunate fellowmen. 

I thank you.

CUBBERS’ CONFAB 


A TYPICAL DEN MEETING PROGRAM 

By CHARLES F. SMITH 

(Reproduced from Cub Leaders’ 

Round Table) 


M EW Cubmaster, or old-timer,. 

you’ll get Cubbing at its best 
if you see that Den meetings con- 
tain at least part of each of the 
ingredients listed below. There 
is nothing rigid about the formula. 
Each Cubmaster, in consultation 
with his Den Chiefs and Den Mo- 
thers, decides on how he wants to 
combine these ingredients to get 
results with the Dens in his parti- 

(Milov 

I. BEFORE THE MEETING 
STARTS 

1. Den Mother and Den Chief 
discuss program outlines 
that the Den Chief received 
and discussed at his Weekly 
Meeting with the Cubmas- 
ter. 

2. Denner prepares • indoor 
and outdoor meetin g 
places. 

II. WHILE THE CUBS ARE 
GATHERING 

1. Each Cub reports to Den 
Mother showing her hi 3 
Cubbook signed by parents, 
reports progress, or asks 
the Den Mother for help. 

2. If indoors, the Den Chief 
shows the first arrival a 
trick or a puzzle. (See any 
issue of the CUB LEAD- 
ERS’ ROUND TABLE.) 
As other boys come in they 
learn the trick or puzzle. If 
it is simple and time per- 
mits, they make it, take it 
home, and try it on their 
parents.

If outdoors, Den. Chief or 
Denner leads games of low 
organization; that is, a 
game in which later arrivals 
l^ay join without interrupt- 
ing the game. 

AFTER ALL ARRIVE 
Opening Song, Yell or 
Grand Howl— OR 
More formal ’opening with 
a single ceremony. (For sug- 
gestions for opening see the

Note: It will aid the Den 

Chief if the Den Mother 
will sit in on this meeting 
and encourage an orderly, 
businesslike meeting with a

1 The Great Plebeian ' 1 — A Great Scout 


S AYS Hon. Camilo Osias, fa-

"Andres Bonifacio was a preai 
Filipino commoner, founder of the 
historic Katipunan; father of the 
greatest Philippine revolution; a 
citizen who was a model of indus- 
try and earnest pursuit’ of know - 
edge and truth through intelligent 
reading ; and a patriot whose life 
urns at all times the embodiment 
of the sound democracy whose 
creed was duty and service and 
rights merited thru toil and s 
orifice.” 

On the thirtieth day of Novem- 
ber of each year, we celebrate 
what is known as National # 

Day. November 30th is a iL 
set aside as a day on wh 
honor Filipino national he

very vivid and appeal in fjo 0 rdered 
the picture of a bloody , j eec jing 
battlefield on which , he bleeding 


purpose, he succeeded in securing 
enough learning with which he 
sought to serve his Country. 

His life was one continuous 
cycle of toil, hardships, and sacri- 
fice. An orphan at an early age, 
he became employed in various 
jobs in the city, and manifested 
versatility in several types of 
work.

CDhat is a Scout? 

Vigor, vitality, vim and punch; 

That is a Scout. 

The courage to act on a sudden

That is a Scout. 

The nerve to tackle the hardest 
thing, 

With feet that climb and hands 
that cling, 

And a heart that never forgets

Sand and Grit in a concrete base, 

That is a Scout. 

A friendly smile on an honest

That is a Scout. 

To look for the best in every man,

gained inspiration to lead a revo- 
lution from the former, and de- 
rived much of the noble, edifying- 
principles embodied in the code of 
the Katipunan, from the latter. 
The Katipunan was the organiza- 
tion he founded in 1892, the three 
aims of which were (1) to resist 
oppression, (2) to foment na- 
tionalism, and (3) to obtain 
Philippine Independence. 

Considering the vast amount of 
unfavorable circumstances which 
constantly assailed Andres Boni- 
facio while engaged in his patrio- 
tic task, one can not but marvel 
at his extraordinary capability 
and remarkable will. He pio- 
neered a great Cause; and like all 
great pioneers, he was willing to 
sacrifice even himself for the good 
of future generations. He was a 
Scout in every sense of the word. 

He was poor and greatly handi- 
capped by serious financial diffi- 
culties; he strove in various ways 
to overcome them. 

He was ignorant and lacked op- 
portunity to study sufficiently like 
other learned men ; he taught him- 
self with patience and determina- 
tion. 

Alone, he was weak and unable 
to carry out his patriotic designs; 
he won friends to his side and 
rallied them on in a glorious fight 
for his Cause. 

He was a fighter, and he advo- 
cated bloodshed ; it was for a 
Cause, just and divine. 

His enemies were powerful and 
unrelenting; he was firm in his 
belief that God is always on the 
side of the righteous; he dared. 

He had nothing but his life to 
give to his country; he gave it 
without regret. 

He was a great Scout.

region between Santo Tomas and 
Calamba makes cycling both easy 
and difficult — easy on the down- 
grade and difficult on the up- 
grade. The third point of the 
Scout Law says: “A Scout is 

Helpful.” Scout Motto is “Be Pre- 
pared”. Helpfulness both in word 
and action and preparedness to do 
a good turn could not have been 
better exhibited when the Scouts 
administered emergency treatment 
to two others of the party who got 
the cramps, one immediately after 
the other. How ever-ready and 
ever-prepared to render service 
were the Scouts? The passers-by 
knew, when they stopped, looked, 
and intriguedly observed the 
Scouts and were convinced that 
Scouts could take good care of 
themselves even on the highways. 

The group had traversed fifty- 
six kilometers. After thirteen 
more, they would be in Calamba. 
The home town of Dr. Jose Rizal 
interestedly witnessed twenty-five 
Scouts lined up in single file as if 
they were on parade. It was 5 :45 
o’clock P.M. when they left the Ca- 
lamba Crossing. Everybody was 
alert and in a joyful mood. 
Darkness was then fast approach- 
ing, and a little drizzle began to 
dampen their sipirits. “Pull-overs 


on and a kilometer in four min- 
utes” was immediately prescribed 
by the leader. 

“Lights on!” was the announce- 
ment made at Pansol. Maria Ma- 
kiling was ever on their right, 
silently urging them swiftly 
ahead! Six-thirty, and at last, 
Los Banos was in sight ! “Fifteen 
minutes to go and three kilometers 
more to close the circle” was the 
timer’s information which passed 
down the file. And he was right, 
for at quarter to seven, they were 
all home again, fatigued and 
breathless, but happy and satisfied. 

Hiking and cycling trips should 
be included in the monthly activi- 
ties of every troop. They offer 
several advantages for the organ- 
ization, in general, and for the 
members in particular. Instruc- 
tions can be given effectively, and 
results can be easily checked upon. 
The discipline of the troop is put 
to a test and improved if wanting. 

It is the nature of boys to look 
forward to more activities after 
the successful completion of one. 
Trips of the kind described above 
afford the best opportunities for 
the acquisition of knowledge con- 
ducive to promotion in class and 
of interest in nature study, the 
development of the physical and 
mental faculties, and also the cul- 
tivation of the spirit of comrade- 
ship — an essential element of suc- 
cessful Scouting.

T)EAR S. P. L.: 

J " -f I always thought that the ap- 
pointment of a Patrol Leader and 
an Assistant Patrol Leader is all 
there is to the organization of a 
Patrol. Now, however, I am con- 
fronted with a problem which sort 
of predicts we’ll have no Patrol 
very soon. Everybody seems to be 
in the mood for becoming Patrol 
Leader. I suggest a yell and the 
whole gang wants to lead. We hit 
on a new song, and everyone wants 
to be song leader. During camps 
and hikes, we spend an awful time 
deciding as to who will be Quarter- 
master, Bugler, or what. 

Can you offer any solution to 
this problem? 

Sincerely yours, 
Manuel R. 

❖ * Jjc 

TY EAR MANUEL: 

The situation you presented in 
your letter is not so pleasant to 
contemplate, and the scene I have 
in mind of your Patrol Meetings is 
probably no less pleasant on one’s 
nerves. I can imagine how you 
feel whenever your boys start 
campaigning to be leaders all in 
the different activities of your 
Patrol. 

If ever there’s anything worth 
applauding in the contents of your 
letter, it is the indication that your 
boys must be terribly interested 
in Scouting and that they probably 
can -easily be turned into excellent 
Scouts if properly handled. 

Patrol Organization, although 
at first glance may seem insigni- 
ficant, is no less significant than 
Troop Organization. The whole 
machinery of Scouting depends on 
Troop Organization; and the lat- 
ter, in turn, counts on Patrol Or- 
ganization for its very existence. 
Thus you see the relative weight 
of Patrol Organization in your 
Troop. 

While I do not say that what 1 
am about to suggest would solve 


your particular problem, I do say 
that I have much faith in it, be- 
cause I have seen- it work more 
than a dozen times in different 
Patrols. 

A certain Patrol I visited very 
recently is composed of leaders. 
But— don’t fly off the handle! 
Keep calm till you hear all about 
it. One of them, of course, is the 
appointed Patrol Leader. I said he 
was appointed, but then, I believe 
I ought to add that he was first 
elected by the Patrol. His ap- 
pointment was only a sort of offi- 
cial action. The Scoutmaster sens- 
ed his popularity and had tested 
his leadership ability. That’s why 
he was made Patrol Leader. 

Then, there is his Assistant Pa- 
trol Leader, officially appointed by 
the Scoutmaster upon his recom- 
mendation. But as I said, the Pa- 
trol was composed of leaders. 
Well, this is how that was ar- 
ranged. 

Everybody in the Patrol is good 
in singing, but there is one boy 
who beats them ail in leading. So 
he got the job as Patrol Song 
Leader. Another fellow, . accord- 
ing to the P. L., was clamoring for 
that same post, but he was ap- 
pointed Yell Leader instead. It so 
happened he had also bright ideas 
about yells. One of the boys is by 
nature inclined toward writing 
and record-keeping. So they made 
him Patrol Scribe. Almost every- 
body wanted to be Grubmaster. 
but one boy beat them all in an 
ingenuous test on foodstuffs and 
their current prices. Then, there 
is also somebody who has done a 
lot of traveling around the town, 
and who knows most of the 
places which can be utilized as Boy 
Scout Camps. He was instantly, 
appointed Hikemaster. One of 
the boys owns a small wooden 
cart, which he lets his dog pull. 
The gang voted him to be Quarter- 
master. He can easily take care of

stopped occasionally to rest for 
several minutes on the way and on 
one occasion, to fix a flat tire 
Reaching Bauang at about foui : 
o clock that afternoon, they were 
elated over the prospect of a 
chance to take a plunge in the sea 
to cool themselves. They rode 
straight to Long Beach, rested a 
few minutes, disrobed, and then 
enjoyed a nice long swim. 

After an hour of joyful swim- 
ming, they took a shower bath 
dressed, and rode north to San 
Fernando, La Union, where they 
took their supper and then re- 
turned to the beach to camp for 
the night. 

There being nothing else to do, 
but rest, they did not bother about 
building a campfire. Using their 
bicycle lamps in the dark, they 
formed a sort of enclosure with 
their bicycles, spread their blan-

There you are, Manuel, I opine 
that is as best as any organization 
you can find anywhere in any 
Troop. Divide the work in your 
Patrol and give each boy specific 
lesponsibility. Let him feel that 
he is a part of the. Patrol, and that 
its existence depends just as much

For the cot, Scouts will have to 
furnish two ordinary gunny sacks, 
such as are used for containing 
rice. They should be slit slight-

six-foot parallel bamboo 
poles, separated a dis- 
tance of one foot, ten 
inches by two sticks, in- 
serted in holes facing-

should clear the closed

three inches. The litter 
itself is now ready. For 
posts, ordinary saplings 
of sufficient strength

should be formed like a

enough to make the

GAMES AND RECREATION 

Edited by G. C. Torres 

National Office Staff Member 


KNOT AND ROPE GAMES 


TF NOT-tying, aside from being 
a useful lore, can also be util- 
ized as an enjoyable pastime. 
Knot-tying games are very popu- 
lar among Boy Scouts, especially 
among Tenderfoot Scouts, who 
get not only fun but also much 
practice from these games. 

Games and Recreational Me- 
thods, by Charles F. Smith, gives 
us some very good knot-tying 
games. We take the liberty of 
reproducing a few in this issue 
of Philippine Scouting. 

COINING CIRCLE RACE — 
Cribs, and Sea Scouts. Form 
each patrol or den in a circle, 
facing inward, and station a jun- 
ior or senior leader in each circle 
to act as judge. Each player on 
the circle holds one end of a piece 
of rope with his left hand, allow- 
ing the other end to hang down. 

At the word “Go” each player 
grasps the hanging end of his 
right-hand neighbor’s rope and 
joins it to his own, using a certain 
joining knot called for at the be- 
ginning of the game. As soon as 
a player ties his knot he drops his 
rope and steps into the circle. 
The first team with all members 
inside the rope circle wins, pro- 
vided the judge pronounces all 
knots correct. 

Notes for Leaders. It adds to 
the fun to let each group yell 
when all members are in the cir- 
cle. Cubs enjoy this feature of 
the game — the younger the play- 
ers, the louder the yelling. 

Group leaders should be allowed 
enough time to teach the knot to 
be used in joining the ropes, and 
they should know a week in ad- 
vance exactly which knot or knots 
will be used, so that they will be 
prepared to teach them. 

Of course, a group will be dis- 
qualified if so much as one knot 
in its chain is incorrect. 

The tendency of too many Scout 
Leaders is to use the square knot 
only in games of this kind, and 
that is the knot they should not 
use with experienced Scouts. Cubs 
might better use the square knot 
and the square bow, while Scouts 
US e other joining knots including 


fisherman’s, weaver’s, sheet bend, 
binder, and carrick. Of all these 
the carrick bend seems most in- 
teresting to both Scouts and Sea 
Scouts. 

r\NE STEP TYING CONTEST 
^ — Scouts and Sea Scouts. 
This contest succeeds outdoors, or 
indoors in a large room. When 
practiced as either a troop or ship 
contest, an adult leader should 
take charge, with patrol or crew 
leaders in charge of their respect- 
ive groups acting as knot judges. 
The game succeeds better with 
comparatively small numbers. 

Before starting, the leader 
should announce the knots to be 
tied, provide each player with a 
rope, and then allow the groups 
a few minutes to practice in their 
■ corners. 

Line up the players by groups 
in a single front rank; each boy 
leader takes his place in front of 
his men. The adult leader, sta- 
tioned in front of the entire 
group, names a knot and begins 
to count along slowly. Following 
a count previously agreed upon — 
about five, depending upon the 
difficulty of the knot — the leader 
commands, “Drop ropes!” The 
junior leaders quickly inspect the 
knots, pronouncing them either 
right or wrong without argument 
or explanation. After the inspec- 
tion the leader instructs all who 
tied the knot correctly to take one 
step forward — as long a step as 
possible. Other knots are tied 
and judged in a like manner. At 
the conclusion the patrol or crew 
that has most members on the 
front line is the winner. 

Notes for Scoutmasters and 
Skippers. When the game i 3 
played outdoors, let all players 
who tie their knots correctly take 
a standing broad jump forward 

Use one knot for a game but 
tie it a number of times. For 
example, first drop ropes on count 
fi 1 > e, next drop on count four etc 
Occasionally, have the Scouts tie 
knots with their eyes closed, with 
the lights out, or behind their 
backs.

“PHILIPPINE SCOUTING”- Approved by the Bureau of Education! 


Hurray! 

Philippine Scouting has just 
been included in the approved list 
of the Bureau of Education! This 
is indicative of growth on our 
part, and of increasing conscious- 
ness on the part of the Bureau of 
Education officials to the merits of 
the Scout program as a supplement 
to their own educational system. « 

Philippine Scouting is OUR ma- 
gazine. This triumph is ours ! 
Let us capitalize on it by doing 
our best to make Philippine Scout- 
ing available to every boy in our 
Troop and to all interested citizens 
in our community. 

Scouts — kindly go over the op- 
posite page and read about our 
SPECIAL SUBSCRIPTION OF- 
FER! 

Scouters — let’s urge every Scout 
in our troop to join the glorious 
crusade for a bigger and better 
PHILIPPINE SCOUTING!

Community Good . . 

(Continued from, page fifteen) ' 

mon Community Good Turns per- 
formed by our boys. Our August 
Issue publishes an article entitled 
“Safety in the School Zones”, 
which describes and explains the 
work of Safety Patrols in school 
areas. These are charged with 
the responsibility of maintaining 
safety conditions in school areas. 
One doesn’t have to be a Boy Scout 
in order to join a Safety Patrol, 
but safety authorities seem to re- 
alize the fitness of Scouts for this 
kind of job; most Safety Patrols 
are composed of Boy Scouts ! 

These, and several other Com- 
munity Good Turns, await to be 
put into execution by civic-spirited 
Scouters and Scouts. Everyone 
does his duty to his country in his 
own little way. The soldier and 
the statesman render service to 
the country in their respective 
fields; the Scout performs his 
service according to his own prin- 
ciples. One of them is to “Do a 
good turn everyday.”

kets within this enclosure and 
slept early, without a care in the 
world. 

They woke up early the next 
morning to enjoy an hour of 
swimming before breakfast. They 
cooked and ate breakfast at the 
beach and then broke camp. They 
spent the rest of the morning in 
sightseeing in and around San 
Fernando. At about noon, they 
rode back to Bauang where they 
ate their lunch at a l’estaurant 
and then finally started on their 
bicycles for their trip home early 
during the siesta hour. 

They took the Naguilian Road 
for Burgos, the eastermost town 
of La Union on the La Union- 
Mountain Province boundary. 
Hard and constant pedalling was 
necessary, considering the fact 



that it was mostly a dirt road they 
were cycling on. It was only in 
the segments that passed through 
principal towns that the road was 
asphalted. The Scouts enjoyed 
coasting at times, but they had to 
alight and walk up the high grades 
in the road, the nature of the x’oad 
being caterpillar-like. Reaching 
Burgos, they stopped and rode on 
the bus line that took them up the 
steep road to Baguio, it being im- 
possible for the boys to pedal up 
that steep grade for about forty 
kilometers. 

They reached Baguio early in 
the evening of that day and the 
following morning, the other 
Scouts were all ears to them as 
they narrated their thrilling cy- 
cling experience. The other Scouts 
were so impressed that after the 
rainy season, there is no saying 
that some of them will be bring- 
ing up proposals for cycling trips. 


Note: It may be interesting to 

add that during two previous 
parades held in the City, the Ba- 
guio troops had a patrol join the 
parades on gaily decorated blen- 
des , which always afforded im- 
pressing spectacles to the on-look- 
e,rs.

COMPRIMIDOS DE 


ALEPSAL 


A BASE DE 

FeniletilmalonilureG 

COMBINADA 


Sedafrivo Poderoso 
Hipnotico 



Los Comprimidos ALEPSAL resultan de la Sinergia 
medieamenuusa ae ia Feniietilmaionuurea con la Teina y la 
atropina, estas dos ultimas en dosis muy debiles. 

La Feniletilmalonilurea, sola, es un Hipnotico y un Seda- 
tivo de grandisimo valor (Drs. Raffegeau, Babin sky, Claude, 
Barre, Cl. Vincent, Maillahd, Berges, Ducoste, Roubino- 
vitch, Quercy, Sabrazes, etc,), pero que empleado solo tiene 
algunos inconvenientes, como uan podido comprobarlo el Prof. 
Carnot (estado de embotami|nto) y loa Doctores Maillard, 
Berges, Ducoste, Laignel, Lavastine, Hartenberg, Claude 
(Colera, Impulsiones) , Marchand. 

Gracias a la feliz asociacion del ALEPSAL, se evitan esos 
defectos y se obtiene un medicamento heroico de la Epilepsia 
convulsiva o intelectua-. Por lo demas, esa asociacion ha 
sido el objeto de una Comunicacion a la Sociedad Medico- 
Psicologica de Paris (Agosto 1921) por el Doctor Ducoste, 
Medico Jefe de los Asilos del Sena, quien declara despues de 
haberla ensayado : 

« No solamente desaparecen las convulsiones a la primera 
« dosis, sino que ya no se observan tampoco ni los trastornos 
« psiquicos, ni la obscuridad intelectual, ni la fatiga, ni el 
« embotamiento fisico tan frecuente cuando se administra el 
«: Gardenal solo. Bajo la influoncia de esta asociacion medica- 
« mentosa la inteligencia del Epileptico se despierta, su 
« actividad se acrece, aunque mantenida en justas propor- 
ciones su Sueiio ya no es ni demasiado pesado ni demasiado 
prolongado, las somnolencias desaparecen; ya no hay 

ligeramente, lo que 


« estrehimiento y la diuresis aumenta 
« esta lejos de ser una desventaja 


INDICACIONES 

El ALEPSAL, ademas^ de su accion especlfica sobre todas 
las manifestaciones epilepticas, ejerce el mejor efecto contra 
las Convulsiones de otra naturaleza, contra todos los estados 
de agitacion psiquica y de hiperexcitabilidad sensorial, el 
nervosismo en general, las Fob ias.

(2) Vease la tesis del Dr. Ladarthe: Traitcment de l Epilepsie par 
VAlcpsal . Facultad de Lyon. 1926. 



El ALEPSAL es de muy gran eficacia en los casos de 
jaquecas, angustia, pruritos toxicos y en iln los espamos tanto 
cardiacos como vasculares e intestinales. 

MODO DE EMPLEO Y DOSIS 

El Tratamiento con el ALEPSAL no requiere ningun 
regimen especial Pueden los enfermos, por consiguiente, volver 
al regimen normal cuidando, sin embargo, de usar moderada- 
mente las bebidas fermentadas. 

La dosis normal es de 2 Comprimidos de ALEPSAL por dia, 
tragados tales cuales son, con una bebida caliente cualquiera, 
fuera de las comidas, por la manana a cosa de las 7 y por 
la tarde a las 5 aproximadamente. Si los ataques son noctur- 
nos exclusivamente, sera mas ventajoso tomar los dos Com- 
primidos por la tarde, uno a las 5, poco mas 6 menos, y otro 
antes de acostarse. La dosis de 3 Comprimidos es bien 
aceptada ; por eso se recurrira a ella en el caso de que la dosis 
normal no producira todos los efectos deseados. 

Aunque el ALEPSAL carece de peligros, convendra sometar 
al enfermo, al comienzo de su empleo a la vigilancia de un 
Medico que, segun los casos, aumentara o disminuira las dosis. 

Algunos epilepticos deben continuar tomando mucho 
tiempo el ALEPSAL, pero al cabo de varias semanas se puede, 
casi siempre, dismimnr las dosis ale incluso a y 2 Com- 
primido por dia. 

Ciertos epilepticos deben de continuar durante mucho 
tiempo el empleo del ALEPSAL; sin embargo generalmente, 
despues desaparicion completa de las crisis, las dosis podran 
ser progresivamente disminuidas por pequenas fracciones de 

a Vz comprimidos, a reserva de volver o tomar la dosis 
inicial en caso de haberse agravado la situacion. 

En todos los otros estados reserviosos la dosis variara 
diariamente entre a Vz comprimido tornado en 2 voces 
(espasmos cardiacos, jaquecas, angustias) hasta 1 y 2 com- 
primidos diarios (nervosidad. insomnios). 

NINOS. — A menos de prescripcion medica, abstenerse de 
d aides el producto si son menores de 5 ahos. Pasada esta edad 
comenzar nor Vz Comprimido diario y aumentar progresiva- 
mente la dosis, si hay lugar, hasta 1 y aun 2 Comprimidos.
