REPORT OF THE AUDITOR FOR THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 



The Govkrxmext of the Philippine Islands, 

Bureau of Audits, 
Manila, P. I,, December 1, 1905. 
Sirs : In compliance with the requirements of rule 38 of Act Xo. 90 
of the Philippine Commission (sec. 60 of Act No. 1402), I have the 
honor to submit mv fifth annual report of the fiscal concerns of the 
Government for the fiscal year 1905, showing the receipts and dis- 
bursements of the various Departments and Bureaus of the Insular 
Government, and of the various provinces, together with other pertinent 
information. 

The report embraces all transactions of the fiscal year which were 
included in accounts received to November 1, 1905, and also settlements 
pertaining to prior fiscal years which were not included in previous 
annual reports. 

During the entire fiscal year 1905 the responsible management of the 
Bureau of Audits devolved by law upon Jlessrs. W. W. Earre and Wm. H. 
Clarke, as Acting Auditor and Acting Deputy Auditor, respectively, by 
reason of the absence of the Auditor, first on accrued leave of absence 
and later under a special assignment as chairman of the Philippine 
Exposition Board, and the work was conscientiously and ably performed. 

The organization of the office and the personnel of the executive staff 
at the close of the fiscal year were as follows : 

Auditor— A. L. Lawshe. 

Deputy Auditor— Wyi. W. Barre. 

Chief e/erJt— Wm. H. Clarke. 

Bookkeeping Division— C. H. Fullaway, Chief. 

Customs Division— A. J. Gibson, Chief. 

Postal Division— \Vyi, A. AVaush, Chief. 

MisceUaneous Division— C. H. Frenxii, Chief. 

Provincial Division— II, W. Gaxgnuss, Chief. 

Property Division— C. A. Smith, Chief. 

During the fiscal year two chiefs of division, W. Y. Handy and 0. H. 
Tibbott, resigned, to return to the Federal service at Washington, after 
having rendered most efficient and valuable service to the Insular Gov- 
ernment.

REPORT OF THE AUDITOR 



Messrs. Handy and Tibbott were succeeded, respectively, by C. H. 
Fullaway and H. W. Gangnuss, their experienced and efficient assistants. 

By reason of absence on accrued leave during a portion of the fiscal 
year the duties of chief of the miscellaneous division devolved upon the 
assistant chief, J. F. Hauck, and those of the chief of the customs division 
devolved upon F. W. Thornton and Ora ililler, the work in each instance 
being efficiently performed. 

Although several resignations, transfers, and absences on accrued leave 
occurred during the fiscal year in all divisions, the volume of work accom- 
plished was equal to that of any prior year. This result is due to the 
faithful, conscientious service of the remaining employees, many of 
whom worked overtime to maintain the standard. 

The authorized personnel at the close of the fiscal year was as follows: 

Auditor; Deputy Auditor; three clerks, class 3; 'four clerks, class 4; 
one clerk, class o: nine clerks, class G; ten clerks, class 7; eleven clerks, 
class 8; fourteen clerks, class 9 ; six clerks, class 10; four clerks, Class A; 
two clerks. Class B; two clerks, Class C; three clerks. Class D; three 
Class E; two clerks, Class F; two clerks, Class G; two clerks, Class H; 
two clerks. Class I; four messengers; and for employment of emergencv 
clerks at not to exceed $100 per month each, not to exceed 1^7 333.33. 

The expense of conducting the Bureau for the fiscal year was, for 
salaries and wages of officers and emplovees, f^210 275 24, and for 
contingent expenses, such as furniture, stationerv, printing! and other 
supplies, W0,049.88. In addition there were outstanding obligations at 
the close of the fiscal year for salaries and wages amounting to i^6,496.33, 
and for contingent expenses, 1^44G.33, making an aggregate ultimate cost 
for the service of the fiscal year of 1P227 269.78 

There were received, examined, and settled 15,359 separate accounts, 
as follows : 

Customs revenue ^^g^ 

Customs disbursement T 

Customs refund 

Miscellaneous 

Postal and money order ' g,^^ 

Propertx ""I^Il'" o' 394 

Special accounts and settlements jL 

Provincial-municipal ^ 

In addition, 569 settlement warrants were issued from the Insular 
salary and expense fund. 

i.^nnn """""r" '"''^'^^ ^'-''^Shod in the aggregate 

14,000 pounds or an average, of less than 15 ounces eaeh. The euston.s 
aecovrnts, included ,n the above total, aggregated in weight 3,150 pounds, 
and 80 per cent of th.s amount consisted of manifests, entries, etc., pre- 
pared by shippmg agents and importers, and required bv law to be sent 
to the Collector of Customs and the Auditor 

While some provincial and customs accounts are very large, it will he

seen that the i)aper work of the great majority of the aeeoimts.iiiust be 
small to reduce the average weight of each account and its accompanying 
vouchers to less than 15 ounces. 

VOLUME OF THE AUDIT. 

The volume of the auditing work done is in no sense restricted ])y the 
aggregate of the ordinary or extraordinary receipts and disbursements 
of the Government. Jn addition to the ramilications and manipulations 
of the various funds, whioli must be followed, aggregating many times 
the original funds received, the accounts of the postal money-order serv- 
ice and of the Insular Treasurer as depositary, including the silver- 
certificate redemption fund, must each receive careful audit, from 
invoices, cheeks, drafts, money orders, and other evidences of debit and 
credit. 

The audit of these dei)ositary and other special classes of accounts, 
while simi)le compared with the audit of receipts and disbursements under 
established legislation, is certainly as comprehensive as the audit usually 
given to commercial accounts, which, as a rule, consists of a mere check- 
ing of approved items and a compilation of results. 

Another series of accounts which may well be taken into consideration 
is that involving the exchanges of currency. These exchanges must 
receive as rigid an audit as to ratios, etc., as any other class of receipts or 
expenditures, and in many cases the transactions are numerous and 
involve minor amounts. 

The stamp accounts of various officers must receive the same careful 
check as is given to money accounts because the stamps have a fixed 
money value in the hands of the holder. 

On this basis the volume of the audit performed by the various divisions 
durin^r the fiscal vear 1905 was as follows :

THE BOOKKEEPING DIVISION. 

Under the provisions of the organic act creating the oflBce of the Insular 
Auditor, this division is charged with maintaining a complete and per- 
manent record of all the financial affairs of the Government and making 
report thereon. 

In my report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1904, an elaborate 
detailed description was given of the various books employed in the 
system of double-entry bookkeeping inaugurated at the beginning of that 
fiscal year. This system, modified and added to in several instances to 
meet conditions arising, is still in force. In this report only a general 
presentation of the scheme will be given. 

The law requires that all revenues of the Insular Government, aside 
from postal revenues, shall be deposited without deduction with the 
Insular Treasurer, and that all withdrawals shall be made by warrant on 
the same officer. It logically follows that such transactions are the basis 
of the Government's fiscal afl'airs and the scheme of bookkeeping has 
accordingly been so constructed. 

The system nuiy be divided, for purpose of illustration, into two gen- 
eral sections: 

First. Actual Treasury transactions, embracing receipts duly classified 
as customs, postal, internal-revenue, and miscellaneous revenues, and 
withdrawals classified by the respective Bureaus and Offices having control 
of the appropriations. 

Second. Transactions forming the basis of statistical information, and 
duly segregated, by means of general leclger accounts, into items of income 
or expense, and resources and liabilities. 

The data in the first section are necessary for primary information as 
to the standing of the Government in its visible cash balance and the 
divisions thereof. For example, all cash receipts at the Treasury are 
debited to an account of that name and credited to an account entitled 
''Available for appropriation;'' when an appropriation is made by the 
legislative body the available account is debited and the appropriation 
account credited under the specific subheading; when a withdrawal is 
made the appropriation account is debited and the withdrawal account 
credited. It is evident, therefore, that the respective balances on available 
and appropriation accounts and the sum of ^Wthdrawals will equal the 
sum of the Treasury receipts. This is an absolute guaranty as to the 
accuracy of the work. 

The entries forming the statistical feature of the bookkeeping are 
made in using the Treasury receipts and withdrawals as a base for the 
audit of the year. For illustration : A, in his capacity as a collector of 



6 



REPORT OF THE AUDITOR 



customs, receives a certain sum of money. He deposits the same in tlie 
Insular Treasury. The Treasury prepares receipts in duplicate and sends 
them to the Auditor for counter signature. The duplicate part of this 
receipt is forwarded to tlie customs officer, the original entered in the 
statistical ledger and the amount thereof charged to the Insular Treasurer 
at once. It is then forwarded to the auditing division for use in verifying 
the customs officer's accounts. The duplicate part of the receipt is sent 
to the customs officer as his voucher. Instead of entering an imniediatc 
credit to the collecting officer, however, the amount is credited to a 
su.spense account known as ''deposits," The auditing division receives 
the account-current of the customs officer making the collection, verifies 
all data in connection therewith, prepares a certificate of settlement on 
the accoimt and forwards it to the bookkeeping division. This certificate 
is entered in the following manner: The officer is first charged with all 
sums received by him and credited with amoimts paid out or deposited 
with the Insular Treasurer; the difference or balance due Government 
remains to the debit of his individual account and constitutes an asset 
of the Government; the sum of the deposits made by him is then debited 
to the deposit account and the various items of revenues credited to their 
respective classified accounts in detail. 

The same method applies to certificates on the accounts of disbursing 
officers. 

The accuracy of the year's work is then determined by two absolute 
proofs: First, when the suspense entries are balanced, and. second, when 
the aggregate of debit and credit statistical entries equal like sums. 

The double-entrj' system is an innovation in Government accounting 
and was adopted with some misgivings, but the experience of tiie past 
two years proves conclusively that if the integrity of the classifications 
IS mamtamed it is an absolute presentation of facts and positive proof of 
the work accomplished. 

While the duties of Government auditors are more or less defined by 
specific egislation, all authorities agree that they are the proper officers 
to adjudicate the acts of collecting and disbursing officers in accordance 
with law, both original and constructive, without interfering with the 
administrative functions of the officers concerned, to the end that the 
financial interests of the Government may be protected. In the Phil- 
ippine system the Auditor is specially empowered witli the functions of 
a comptroller of the treasury, in some cases with final jurisdiction and 
in others subject only to review by the Secretary of War It logically 
follows, therefore, that the results from the e.xercise of such functions, 
either in the form of certificates of settlement on the accounts of collect- 
ing and disbursing officers prc^pared and certified bv the Auditor after 
niatheniatical and legal review of accounts submitted; or in the recording 
of the financial enactments of the legislative body, should be centralized 
and form the proper basis for fiscal information. 



FOR THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.

No matter how nuicli bookkeeping may be done by the Treasurer or by 
otlier olKcers collecting and disbursing funds, the Auditor can do no less 
bookkcepin^r than now and at the same time present a true statement of 
the Government's linaneial condition. 

There seems to be some misai^prehension on the part of Bureau chiefs 
and others as to the extent of the bookkeeping performed in this office. 
The work accomplished is confined to maintaining a proper check on 
Treasury receipts and withdrawals, the proper segregation of funds avail- 
able for appropriation and those appropriated for specific purposes, and 
entering the aggregated elements of settlements of othcers' accounts as 
made l)y auditing divisions, based upon the primary Treasury receipts 
and withdrawals as later explained in detail. These certificates of settle- 
ment may cover an officer's accountability for one month or the entire 
fiscal year, and only the aggregate collections and disbursements for the 
period covered are entered in the statistical accounts; in the former as 
to classification of revenue, either customs, postal, internal, or miscel- 
laneous, and in the latter according to the subheading of appropriation 
acts authorizing the expenditure. The transactions in detail are not 
entered on the books, although as a separate proposition detailed state- 
ments of expenditures are made in the auditing divisions for the War 
Department's records at Washington. The keeping of the accounts in 
detail is properly the work of the administrative officers in their Bureaus. 
yiore bookkeepers are employed, respectively, as such, in the various 
divisions of the ^Manila custom-house, in the office of the Collector of 
Internal Revenue, and in any of the other large Bureaus, in making 
entries of their transactions in detail, than are employed in this office in 
making the aggregated entries for the whole Philippine service. Insular 
and provincial, including the city of Manila. 

The Accounting Act, recently passed, has authorized several long- 
needed changes in the work of this division. Chief among these is the 
abolishment of fiscal-year restrictions in appropriation and advance of 
public funds, leaving the date of expenditure to fix the statistical fiscal 
year. It thereby becomes unnecessary to eliminate small appropriation 
balances. This, together with adjustments between fiscal-year appro- 
priations, has constituted a large proportion of the detailed w^ork of 
this division. 

Not far short of this in its importance is the adoption of the "charge 
back" system in the audit of accounts. Payments made in good faith and 
mathematically correct are allowed in expenditures. If a quasi-legal 
examination reveals any question on which more information is desired 
the amount is charged bach to the officer in suspense, subject to his 
explanation within a given period. If the matter is not satisfactorily 
explained, the amount of the sum so held in suspense is entered as an 
absolute charge against the officer and classified statistically so as to 
reduce the expenditure charge originally made. It will readily be seen 



8 



BEPOBT OP THE AUDITOR 



that the revenues and expenditures of the Government are more speedily 
and accurately shown by this method, while the elements of safety and 
correctness do not suffer by the new departure. 

Commercial and governmental bookkeeping, wiiile fundamcntallv alike, 
are radically different in their application in that certain essential ele- 
ments of each are surplusage in the other; for example, in commercial 
bookkeeping it is necessary to show the transaction incident to the 
purchase, barter, and sale of commodities, and the value of merchandise 
remaining on hand is of paramount importance. In Governmental work 
this is not essential. Aside from expenditures for salaries the purchases 
of Government Bureaus are usually confined to immediate or apparent 
needs for accomplishment of the work assigned to that Bureau, and indi- 
vidual accountability for such purchase of a nonexpendable character is 
properly assigned to a property division in the administrative office or 
m the Auditor's office. It follows that such purchases should be classified 
statistically as concluded expenditures and have no place in a balance 
sheet as Government assets. 

On the other hand, governmental sources of revenue arc confined in 
the mam to taxation, customs imposts, sale of or percentage on fran- 
chises, etc., and these factors are absent in a mercantile business. Further, 
the merchant employs his funds or assets without the necessitv of record- 
ing his intentions, while in governmental bookkeeping it is nec'essary to so 
treat receipts and withdrawals that the legislative body may know what 
funds are available to be set aside or appropriated for specific purposes, 
and that the identity of such funds, after appropriation, mav be preserved 
until finally withdrawn and expended, or returned to available funds if 
not recjuired. 

Under the new Accounting Act the Auditor is expected to prescribe the 
system of detail bookkeeping to be followed by the various Bureaus and 
Offices, m addition to prescribing the form and manner in which accounts 
shall be rendered for purposes of audit. The two propositions are radi- 
cally different. Even the most experienced accountant and bookkeeper 
would be exceedingly wary about prescribing a system of bookkeeping for 
any enterprise without first having had opportunity to acquaint himself 
thoroughly with the peculiarities and intricacies of the business in order 
to meet them in the best way. It would require days, and possibly weeks, 
of actual experience in some of the Bureaus having large and varied trans- 
actions to formulate and prescribe the best internal system for them. 
iNo expert force was provided for this work in the appropriation act, and 
the amount of work which may be done in this line in the near future 
IS, in consequence, necessarily limited. 

The Auditor will endeavor to assist the bookkeepers regularlv employed 
m the various Bureaus in formulating correct and satisfactory svstems, 
when called upon to do so or when occasion makes such action desirable 
or necessary.

prevailed when Mexican currency ceased to be received for public dues, was employed in the 
abulations elsewhere in this report.

REPORT OF THE AUDITOR 



On March 8, 1902, the Congi-ess of the United States passed a law to 
the effect that — 

(a) All Philippine products shipped direct to the United States, en- 
tered free of duty and consumed therein, shall be free of Philippine export 
duty ; 

(b) All duties and taxes collected in the United States upon articles 
and foreign vessels coming from the Philippines shall be deposited to the 
credit of the Philippine T^easu^}^ 

From the date of the enactment of that law to June 30, 1905, the 
receipts from this source were as follows : 

Export duties collected in the Philippines mhject to refund.

It is obvious, therefore, that the effect of the act of March 8 1902,

shows the receipts in the United States to be in excess of the amount of 
refundable export duties collected in the Philippines.

The chief of the customs division while on leave in the United States 
diirin<j: September, 1904, informally invited the attention of the United 
States Treasury Department to the fact that no deposit had been made 
by the United States Government to the credit of the Philippine Treasury 
on account of ''Fines, penalties, and forfeitures'' collected on Philippine 
products and foreign vessels from the Pliilippines, and thereafter such 
deposits have been regularly made. 

The act of March 8, 190*?, provides that all collections on account of 
both diiiies and taxes collected in the United States upon articles coming 
from the Philippine Archipelago shall be held as a separate fund and 
paid into the Treasury of the Philippine Islands; but thus far the law 
has been construed to embrace only duties arising in the customs service, 
although it seems quite clear that the law was intended to cover all 
internal revenue collected in the United States on cigars and cigarettes 
imported from the Philippine Islands and on tobacco imported from the 
Philippine Islands and manufactured in the United States, as well as 
on all other articles imported from the Philippine Islands; the proceeds 
from the sale of all articles from the Philippines seized by customs offi- 
cers of the United States; all moneys collected in the United States under 
the provisions of an act of Congress dated August 2, 1882, entitled "The 
passenger act/' from foreign vessels arriving from the Philippine Islands, 
and alf moneys collected in the United States under the provisions of an 
act of Congress dated August 3, 1882, entitled "An act to regulate im- 
migration,'' from foreign vessels arriving from the Philippines. 

The Auditor will take up tliis question, through the War Department, 
with the proper accounting officers of the United States Treasury with a 
view to recovering for the Philippine Treasury the amounts which seem 
to be due on account of taxes collected as stated.

THE POSTAL DIVISIOKT. 

In this division are settled the postal accounts of all postmasters in 
the Philippine Islands, the money-order accounts of postmasters at money- 
order post-offices, the general money-order account with the United States 
Government, the postage-stamp account of the Bureau of Posts, and tlie 
accounts of the disbursing officer for the Bureau of Posts and for the 
Fortin building. 

In the postal ledgers there is kept a personal account with each post- 
master in his dual capacity of collecting and disbursing officer, which 
account also covers his stamp accountability. Separate ledgers are kept 
for money-order accounts. 

Numerous applications for duplicates of money orders lost, stolen, or 



FOR THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 



13 



accidentally destroyed before payment, referred by the Director of Posts 
to the Auditor for certification, are verified by reference to the money- 
order records and files. Applications for settlement warrants in lieu 
of orders remaining unpaid more than one year after the last day of the 
month of issue are likewise verified and settlements stated. There are 
now on file in this division approximately 270,000 money orders, aggre- 
gating more than $12,000,000, issued since July 1, 1901, the date of the 
separation of the Philippine money-order system from that of the United 
States. 

It is pleasing to note that there are fewer delinquencies than formerly 
on the part of postmasters in regard to the prompt rendition of accounts. 
The improvement is largely due to the active cooperation of the Director 
of Posts. Act Xo. 1191, providing for quarterly instead of monthly 
postal accounts, effective as of July 1, 1904, has simplified the settlement 
of postal accounts. 

At the close of the fiscal year there were 417 post-offices, of which 
number 62 were authorized to transact money-order business. 

The postal receipts, as shown by the accounts of the different offices, 
were ^273,341.60, and the expenditures were ^345,080.77, these expend- 
itures being solely for the post-office service as distinguished from the 
expenses of the Bureau of Posts. 

The value of money orders issued was $3,444,053.48. The value of 
money orders paid in the Philippines was $1,784,820.54, and the value of 
those'paid in the United States was $1,794,888.53. 

Elsewhere in this report under a separate subtitle appears a statement 
of the money-order transactions of the Bureau of Posts, and a statement 
of the general account between the Philippine Government and the 
United States.

THE MISCEIiliANEOUS DIVISION. 

This division has heretofore audited and settled all revenue and disburs- 
ing accounts excepting those pertaining to the customs, postal, and pro- 
vincial services. 

These accounts cover disbursements on account of the following Bu- 
reaus in addition to miscellaneous appropriations not embodied in the 
regular appropriation acts, as well as collections from all sources made 
by the said Bureaus : 

Philippine Commission, Executive Bureau, Civil Service Board, Insu- 
lar Purchasing Agent, Bureau of Health, Quarantine Service, Bureau of 
Mining, Weather Bureau, Bureau of Public Lands, Bureau of Agri- 
culture, Bureau of Ethnological Survev, Bureau of Government Labora- 
tories, Bureau of the Philippine Civil Hospital, The Civil Sanitarium, 
Signal Service, Bureau of Philippines Constabulary, Bureau of Prisons, 
Bureau of Coast and Geodetic Survey, Bureau of Engineering, Bureau 
of the Insular Treasurj-, Bureau of the Insular Auditor, Bureau of 
Justice, Bureau of Education, Bureau of Printing, Bureau of Archives, 
Bureau of Architecture, the American Circulating Library, Official Ga- 
zette, education of Filipino students in the United States, custodian of 
the Santa Potenciana building, superintendent of the Intendencia build- 
ing superintendent of the Oriente building, Philippine Exposition Board, 
and the city of Manila. 

On account of the ramifications of the work of this division and the 
WH O range of appropriations covered, it is impracticable to comment upon 
each particular phase. The many laws and amendments alTecting the 
various accounts and the constant changes resulting from current legisla- 
tion require that each examiner must be an experienced accountant and 
thoroughly familiar with all legislative measures of the Philippine 
Commission. 



FOR THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 



15 



•A resume of the work accomplished during the fiscal year 1905 shows 
that. 5,540 moiitlily accounts were audited and certified, and that in addi- 
tion thereto 451 certificates covering special settlements were executed. 

On account of tlie provisions of Act Xo. 619 and the many other 
legislative measures affecting the finances of the Bureau, the accounts of 
the Philippines Constahulary present many intricate features. The audit 
of the accounts received from forty or more disbursing officers of this 
Bureau form no small proportion of the work of this division, since each 
supply officer renders from three to five monthly accounts. The correct- 
nt»ss of the special-fund accounts created by Act Xo. G19 can be 
determined only by a careful audit of all disbursing accounts involved. 
The svstem of commissary accountability i)rescribed for this Bureau is 
practically the same as that in vogue in the United vStates Army. 

Another account deserving of special mention is that rendered by the 
Insular disbursing agent at Washington. The disbursements therein 
contained are reported in lump sum and the audit of this account requires 
the exercise of careful judgment in the segregation and distribution of 
the various items of expense to the Bureaus concerned. 

THE PROVINCIAIi DIVISION. 

This division has heretofore been charged with the audit and settle- 
ment of the pro\'incial-municipal, internal-revenue-forestry, and internal- 
revenue-ordinary accounts of the forty-five provincial treasurers, which 
include the five district treasurers of Moro Province, the internal-revenue- 
forestrv and internal-revenue-ordinary collection accounts of the city 
assessor and collector of the city of ^fanila, the accounts of the disburs- 
ing officer of the Forestry Bureau and Internal Eevenue Bureau, and the 
internal-revenue stamp accounts of the Collector of Internal Eevenue and 
the Insular Treasurer, and the cattle registration-stamp accounts. 

Durino- the past year monthly property returns of Congressional relief 
fund rice have also been received in this division from a number of 
provinces and examined in connection with the provincial-municipal 
accounts of provincial treasurers. Under the provisions of Executive 
Order Xo. 64, series of 1003, the money value of rice sold or exchanged 
for services and the expenditure thereof was taken up and accounted for 
in the provincial-municipal accounts. 

In addition to the above this division received monthly reports from 
municipal treasurers of their cash transactions, monthly reports of the 
committees designated under the provisions of Acts Xos. 752 and 1233 
to count the cash of provincial treasurers, and monthly deposit and trust- 
fund accounts of provincial treasurers and statements of their accounts 
with municipalities. These reports are examined and checked in con- 
nection with the settlement of the provincial-municipal accounts. 



I 



16 REPORT OP THE AUDITOR 

The number of accounts settled and certified for the fiscal year 1905 
were as follows : 

Provincial-municipal gg j 

Internal Revenue: 

Forestry 322 

Ordinary, Act No. 1189 ~~ 492 

Miscellaneous revenues and disbursing accounts 96 

Total ......1:^ 

The accounting act, enacted October 10, 1905, provides for a corps of 
district auditors whose duty it will be to receive, audit, and settle accoiuits 
pertaining to provincial funds. The operation of this new auditing 
system for provincial accounts will be extended to the various provinces 
as rapidly as the field examinations can be brouglit to a current date. 
The complete establishment of the system is to be accomplished not later 
than June 30, 1906. 

The provincial work heretofore performed bv this division will here- 
after be done by a new provincial division in charge of the cliief district 
auditor, and hereafter the old provincial division will become the internal- 
revenue division, and have, in addition, analogous work pertaining to 
other branches of the service. 

INTERNAL REVENUE. 

Act No. 1189, Philippine Commission, providing for the collection of 
internal-revenue taxes, went into operation on August 1, 1904, and taxes 
became due and were collected from and after that date on matches, 
cigars, cigarettes, manufactured tobacco, fermented liquors, and distilled 
spirits. 

The following taxes became due and were collected on and after Jan- 
uary 1, 1905: Documentarj' stamp tax, poll or cedula tax, certain license 
taxes, and taxes on banks and bankers, insurance companies, forestry 
products, mining concessions granted prior to April 11, 1899, and a tax 
on business, manufacture, and occupation. 

The industrial, cedula, and stamp taxes, formerly collected as joint 
provincial and municipal revenues, ceased to be collectible after Decem- 
ber 31, 1904, and the tax on forestry products, which had formerly been 
collected as an Insular revenue and the proceeds thereof, after deducting 
the expenses of the Forestry Bureau, distributed pro rata among the 
provinces, to be divided equally between the province and the municipal- 
ities thereof, became, on and after January 1, 1905, an internal-revenue 
tax under Act No. 1189. 

The internal-revenue taxes assessed and collected by virtue of this act 
are distributed as follows: 

(1) To municipalities in which collected: License taxes on theaters, 
museums, cockpits, concert halls, pawnbrokers, circuses, and billiard 
rooms.

(2) To provinces and inmiicipalities jointly: The poll or cedula tax, 
except in the case of the >Moro Province, wliere the entire collection from 
the cedilla tax accrues, without division, to the province. 

(3) The collections from all other internal-revenue taxes are deposited 
in the Insular Trcasurv. Of this amount To per cent accrues to the 
Insular Government and is deposited as Insular revenue, and 2o per cent 
is deposited as refundable internal revenue and returned to the provinces, 
10 per cent to be used for >,^eneral provincial purposes and 15 per cent 
to be returned to the municipalities, of which latter sum one-third is 
devoted to municipal school ])urposes and the balance to general munic- 
ipal jnirposcs. except in the .AEoro Province, where the entire 25 ]ier cent 
is devoted to general provincial purposes. 

The refunds to the provinces and municipalities and to the city of 
^Manila, whiih, for this purpose, is considered both as a province and as 
a municipality, arc made quarterly by settlement warrant upon the l)asis 
of their respective populations according to the census of 1903. 

Internal-rev(»nue collections for the fiscal year 1905, and distribution 
of the ])rocceds, as provided by law and as above outlined, were as follows:

The figures contained in tliis report will not agree with those given by 
the Collector of Internal Revenue for the reason that the report of the lat- 
ter is based upon reports from the various municipal treasurers through- 
out the Archipelago, showing the collections made during ten-day periods, 
while the figures in tliis report are based upon the monthly accounts- 
current of the several provincial treasurers, as audited. For the purpose 
of sliowing the amount of internal-revenue collections, the Collector of 
Internal Revenue keeps two abstracts of collections, one temporary and 
the other permanent. All of the ten-day reports from municipal treas- 
urers received in the office of the Collector of Internal Revenue during any 
ten-day period are entered in the temporary abstract regardless of tlic 
period covered by the report received from any municipal treasurer, and 
the total is given as the collection for that period. The ten-day reports 
are later entered in the permanent abstract under the province, munici- 
pality, and particular ten-day period to which they pertain. Owing to 
the remoteness- of many municipalities and the difficulty of communica- 
tion with others, there is considerable delay in receiving the reports from 
all municipalities for any particular ten-day period. The Internal Rev- 
enue Bureau's permanent abstract for any fiscal year may not be complete 
until eight or ten months after its close. 

For the collection of internal revenue a municipal treasurer is merely 
a deputy of the provincial treasurer, and is visited at regular intervals by 
the provincial treasurer or his traveling deputy, who cliecks his accounts 
and takes up his collections, which are turned into the provincial treasury. 
The settlements of the Auditor are based upon the monthly accounts 



FOR THE PHILIPPINE ISI^VNDS.

rendered l)y the provincial treasurer, who is the accountable officer. It 
frecjuentlv happens, in the case of remote municipalities, that collections 
made i)y the municipal treasurer are not taken up by the traveling deputy, 
and do not appear in the monthly account-current of the provincial treas- 
urer until several weeks, or even months, after the ten-day period during 
which the collections were made by the municipal deputy. It is obvious, 
therefore, that any figures given by the Collector of Internal Revenue,, 
whether based upon the temporary or permanent abstract, may not agree 
with the figures contained in tlie Auditor's report. The reports of the 
C'olleetor of Internal Kevenue may be regarded as anticipatory with refer- 
ence to final deposits of available funds in the Treasury.

•In the case of the Moro Province the entire 25 per cent of Insular collections and the whole 
amount of the cedula collections accrue to the provincial trea.sury without division. 

»>For the purposes of the refund of internal-revenue collections, the citv of Manila is considered 
both as a province and a municipality. 



INTERNAL-REVENUE STAMP ACCOUNT. 

During the first half of the fiscal year, from July 1 to December 'M, 
1904, stamp taxes contimied to be collected under the provisions of cer- 
tain royal decrees and orders of the former Spanish government and 
General Orders, No. 57, military governor's office, dated March 31, 1900. 

In accordance \y\i\\ section 18, Act No. 83, "as amended by Act No. 133, 
all collections from this source in organized provinces became a joint pro- 
vincial-municipal revenue. These stamps were furnished by the Acting 
Collector of Internal Revenue for the Islands to the various provincial 
treasurers, through the Insular Treasurer. 



FOU THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 



21 



The InUTiial Revenue Law of 1904 provided for the repeal of the 
existing stamp taxes on and after January- 1, 1905^ and the substitution 
therefor of new taxes on documents, cigars, cigarettes, distilled spirits, 
fermented liquors, manufactured tobacco, matches, banks and bankers, 
insurance companies, forestry products, Spanish mining concessions, and 
certain occupations, all of w^hich are collectible by means of the sale and 
affixture of stamps. 

All of the old class of stamps that were in the hands of collecting offi- 
cers were therefore called in and destroyed and new stamps issued for 
the collection of the taxes imposed by xVct Xo. 1189. These new stamps 
consist of two series: Documentary stamps for use on documents, and 
internal-revenue stamps for use in the collection of all other taxes imposed 
by Act No. 1189, except the poll or cedula tax. 

This act repealed the former cedula tax and provided that after Jan- 
uary 1, 1905, every male inhabitant of the Philippine Islands between 
the ages of 18 and 60, with certain exceptions, should pay an annual tax 
of ^1 by purchasing a cedula or certificate of registration, before the last 
Saturday in April (Class A). 

Those w^ho neglect to procure a cedula before the last Saturday in 
April in each year must pay ^2 (Class B), while all persons arriving 
in the Islands after that date may obtain a cedula (Class D), witliin 
twenty days after landing, by paying ^1. All jiersons who are exempt 
from the payment of this tax may obtain a certificate of exemption 
(Class C).

PORESTBY TAX SETTLEMENTS. 



Under the provisions of Act No. 5-27 of the Philippine Commission^ 
the net amount of collections on forestry products made in the provinces 
and the city of Manila has, since July 1, 1902, been returned pro rata to 
the provinces from whicli the products were taken after the entire expenses 
of conducting the Forestry Bureau and the service under its control have 
been deducted from the gross collections. 

This law continued in force to December 31, 1904, when the forestry 
tax became, by Act No. 1189, a part of the new system of internal-revenue 
taxes, and is thereafter included in the statement of collection and refund 
of internal revenues. 

During the period July 1 to December 31, 1904, the expenses of the 
Forestry Bureau, including those former expenses w^hich had not been 
previously charged against the forestry collections, exceeded the collec- 
tions made during the same period. 

All refunds to taxpayers of erroneous collections, and so much of 
the expenses as equaled the collections, have therefore been charged 
against the collections, and the balance of the expenditures for the period 
July 1 to December 31, 1904, has been borne by the Insular Government. 

Following is a statement of the forestry collections and refunds, by

THE PROPERTY DIVISION. 



This division is charged with the settlement oi' property returns and 
all matters coming within the administrative jurisdiction of the Auditor 
under the requirements of Acts Nos. 215 and 909 of the Philippine Com- 
mission, which provide that every officer or agent who has public civil 
property in his charge shall be deemed responsible for the value thereof 
until relieved from such responsibility pursuant to the provisions of said 
acts. This division is also charged with the reviewing of all reports of 
inspectors or committees on condemned property, of which 343 w^ere 
received and passed upon during the fiscal year. 

The returns on hand July 1, 1904, numbered 552, and 2,269 were 
received during the fiscal year, making a total of 2,821 ; of these, 2,394 
were examined, leaving a total of 427 remaining unaudited at the close 
of the fiscal year. 

Pursuant to a resolution of the Philippine Commission dated March 
14, 1905, Insular property was transferred to the city of Manila under 
the supervision of the chief of this division, of which the following is

PROPERTY LOSSES FROM UNAVOID.\BLE CAUSES. 

Mr. S. K. Fitzhugh, provincial treasurer of Tayabas, was found to be 
short of nonexpendable property to the value of ¥=172.83. As the loss 
occurred through no fault of the officer, he was relieved from account- 
ability by written consent of the Governor-General, as provided in rule 29 
of Act No. 90. 

Mr. W. W. Leggett, supervisor of Abra Province, was found short of

property to tlie value of ^SO.CU), and relieved in the same manner, as was 
also Lieut. L. E. McMurry, Philippines Constabulary, of property to the 
value of ¥=198.66. xhoTfaffes 

The claims hereinbefore mentioned do not include several ^pfaym?? now 
in course of adjustment for which no claim has as yet been made. 

The Philippine system of property accountability is similar to that 
of the War Department, it having been an inheritance from the military 
government of the Islands. It is a safe system, but open to the possible 
objection that it necessitates an undue amount of paper work. 

The Auditor ret^ommends that the system be revised so as to eliminate 
the rc(|uirement for periodical returns covering the fixed, nonperisliable, 
nonexpendable property assets of the Government, by requiring them to 
be permanently listed in the Auditor's office and in the various Bureaus 
against officers responsible therefor, thus reducing reports or returns to 
those covering expendable property, for which special provision should 
be made according to the nature of the particular service concerned. A 
much greater latitude should be allowed in accounting for property which 
in the ordinary course of service legitimately expends itself in use. 

BEDISTKIBUTION OF DUTIES, BY DIVISIONS. 

In view of the changes made by the Accounting Act a new distribution 
of duties for the various divisions has been made, analogous accounting 
or similar systems being thrown into the same division as nearly as prac- 
ticable. Under this new distribution the accounts of the various Bureaus 
and Offices will be examined and settled by divisions as follows: 

Bookkeeping Treasurer's general account, Treasurers depos- 

itary account, and continue as the general record and statistical division. 

Customs rfin*.sio;i.— Bureau of Customs, Bureau of Navigation, Bureau 
of Port Works, Bureau of Coast and Geodetic Survey, Bureau of Printing, 
Bureau of Agriculture, and Weather Bureau. 

Inlernal-reveuue division.— Bwtc^w of Internal Eevenue, City of Ma- 
nila, Bureau of Forestry, Bureau of Justice, and Bureau of Public Works. 

Postal division.— Bwrem of Posts, Signal Service, Bureau of Cold 
Storage, Bureau of Civil Service, and Bureau of Audits. 

Miscellaneous division.— Executive Bureau, Bureau of Constabulary, 
Bureau of Education, Bureau of Health, Quarantine Service, Bureau of 
Prisons, Bureau of Science, Bureau of Lands, Bureau of the Treasury, 
and all miscellaneous accounts not especially enumerated. 

Provincial division, — Provincial accounts, until all district auditors 
are installed, revision of provincial accounts, and supervision of district 
auditors 

Property division, — Insular property accounts. Bureau of Supply, and 
accounts of Insular disbursing agent at Washington.

INSULAR RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES. 



INSULAR RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES. 



Following is a statement, by Departments, Bureaus, and Offices, of the 
receipts and expenditures of the Insular Government, arranged in such 
form as to sliow the gross receipts of each Bureau having sources of 
receipts and revenues, the refunds of such receipts, and the net revenues, 
as well as the gross expenditures, the refunds to such expenditures, the 
net revenues, the net expenditures, the excess of revenue over expenditure 
or the excess of expenditure over revenue, as the case may be, in every 
Bureau and branch of the Insular service. Many of the Insular Bureaus 
have no sources of revenue whatever, but this method of stating the fiscal 
affairs affords a convenient means of comparing receipts and disbui-se- 
nients and readily ascertaining net results. 

Under the laws in force during the fiscal year 1905 the Bureau of 
Printiu'T and the Bureau of Government Laboratories were required to 
perform°services for otiier Bureaus without charge therefor and to render 
to the Auditor statements of the services performed. For statistical pur- 
poses only these charges have been included as expenditures of the various 
Bureaus and Offices concerned, corresponding amounts being credited as 
revenues to the Bureau of Printing and the Bureau of Government Labo- 
ratories, respectively, in order to show the real earnings of the various 
Bureaus and the actual cost of their maintenance. 

Revenues are shown under the particular sources from which dern^d, 
and expenditures are stated for the general purpose for which made under 
the digest headings shoM-n in the appropriation acts. Salaries and wages 
specifically appropriated for as such are included under that general head- 
ing, and expenses for transportation of supplies and travel on official 
business are included under the general head of transportation when so 
appropriated for. Contingent expenses include those necessary expendi- 
tures in the conduct of a business or office which are not provided for 
under other specific headings. They include purchases of furniture, sta- 
tionery, supplies, traveling expenses of officers when not otherwise 
provided for, cost of telegrams and cablegrams, rents, ice, etc. 

All expenditures from funds derived from bond issues or from funds 
for public works or special purposes, and not pertaining to the adminis- 
trative cost of condubting a Bureau, are excluded from the regular state- 
ment of revenues and expenditures of the Bureau concerned, as the tunds 
from which such expenditures were made were not derived from regular 
sources of revenue and the expenditures therefrom being for extraor- 
dinary purposes. g_

STATISTICAIi EARNINGS AND EXPENDITURES, AND PAYMENTS 
TO THE CITY OF MANILA AND TO THE PROVINCES. 

Included in both net receipts and net disbursements is the sum of 
^785,133.83, the combined statistical revenues of earnings of the Bureau 
of Printing and the Bureau of Government Laboratories, and shown as 
statistical expense of the various Bureaus involved, the actual casli rc^ 
ceipts and expenditures having been that much less, or i*=22,313,856.91 
and ^23,712,580.83, respectively, but the Auditor is required to show 
these items for statistical purposes. Under the hiw as recently amended 
all inter-Bureau transactions of this sort will hereafter appear as actual 
cash transactions, but will be shitistically separated in the audit. Like- 
wise in the expenditures, the sums of 1?=1,51(),731.81 paid to the city of 
Manila as the Insular Government contribution to the support of the 
city, and ^192,429.27 paid to provinces, as a contribution to their sup- 
port, appear in addition to loans advanced to provinces and revenues 
regularly ceded by law. Thus these actual expenditures of the Insular 
Government, in effect, become receipts or revenues of the city of ilanila, 
and of the provinces, in the amounts stated. 



MISCELLANEOUS RESOURCES AND 
LIABILITIES.

MISCELLANEOUS RESOURCES AND LIABILITIES. 



In the following statements of account is shown the relation of the 
Insular Government to the several special funds arising from the issue 
of bonds for specific purposes, and to the several quasi-trust funds held 
pending claim for refund after the conditions of the law have been com- 
plied with. 

These statements are omitted from the regular account of Insular 
receipts and expenditures, as they do not affect the income or expenditures 
of the Insular Government in any manner until covered into general 
funds by reason of noncompliance with the specific provisions of the law 
authorizing refunds within given periods. 

In the case of bond issues for specific purposes the full amoimt of 
principal and premium derived from the sale is credited to the fund, and 
it is charged with the par value of the issue, for the reason that the 
Insular Government assumes the obligation and carries the same under 
an account of bonded indebtedness. 

The cash balances on said accounts are included in the Insular Treas- 
urer's account and in the balances in the hands of collecting and dis- 
bursing officers. For every item of revenue received on account of a 
special fund the liability of the Insular Government is increased, and for 
every expenditure there is a corresponding decrease. 

THE IITSUIiAR GOVERNMENT IN ACCOUNT WITH THE

THE CONGRESSIONAL RELIEF FUND. 



By act of Congress approved March 3, 1903, th^ sum of $3,000,000, 
United States currency, was appropriated for relief of distress in the 
Philippine Islands, to be expended under the direction and in the discre- 
tion of the Philippine Goverrunent, in such proportions as they deem wise, 
in the direct purchase and distribution or sale of farm implements, faiTa 
animals, supplies and necessaries of life, and through the employment of 
labor in the construction of Government wagon roads and other public 
works. The act further provides that the Governor of the Philippines 
shall submit to the Secretary of War a statement of all expenditures 
under this fund. f 

The sum so appropriated was transmitted to the Treasurer of the Phil- 
ippine Islands and taken into the account of Insular funds as =P6,000,000. 
As contemplated by the appropriating act, and for the purpose of making 
the reports required thereunder, the identity of the fund has been main- 
tained and expenditures made therefrom have been segregated from the 
ordinary expenses of the Government. 

The procedure inaugurated by the Philippine Commission as to the 
disposition of this fund was to set apart by means of appropriation acts 
specific sums for specified purposes, such as public works, etc., as well as 
amounts for expenditure under the direction of the Governor-General in 
such manner as might from time to time be authorized by resolution of 
the Commission. 

The following statement of account shows the expenditures from the 
fund, as audited, during the fiscal year 1905, together with the various 
cash balances remaining on hand at the close of the fiscal year :

FISCAL AFFAIRS OF THE PROVINCES. 

Under the provisions of Act No. 83, as amended by Act No. 133 and 
other acts, the revenue collected in the provinces and municipalities 
for local purposes is not deposited in tlie Insular Treasury, but is depos- 
ited with the treasurer of the province in which collected, except the 
internal-revenue collections, which accrue to the Insular Government, 
the provinces, and the municipalities, in the proportions of 75, 10, and 
15 per cent, respectively. The refundable 25 per cent is deposited in the 
Insular Treasury as "refundable internal revenue,'' and subsequently 
refunded, as provided by law, in proportion to population as shown by 
the last census. That portion of revenue which accrues to each munici- 
pality is returned to the municipal treasurer and disbursed by him under 
direction of the municipal board, in accordance with the general pro- 
visions of the Municipal Code. 

Under the provisions of the new Accounting Act the audit of the pro- 
vincial accounts is being taken over by district auditors, as explained 
elsewhere in this report, the new system to be completely established by 

June 30, 190G. . 

Information in detail as to the internal-revenue collections and retunds 
therefrom to provinces will be foimd elsewhere in this report, on pages 
19 and 20.

THE MONEY-ORDER SYSTEM. 



THE MONEY-ORDER SYSTEM. 



DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND POLICE, BUREAU OF POSTS. 

The moiU'V-order system ol! tlie Philippine Ishinds, operated bv the 
Bureau of Posts, is analogous to that of the United States in all of its 
details. 

iloney orders issued in the United States and \Kud in the Philippine 
Islands are charged to the United States. Orders issued in the Philip- 
pines and paid in the United States are charged to the Philippines. 
Under this reciprocal arrangement paid orders are respectively transmit- 
ted as remittances to the country in which issued. 

The only revenue which accrues from the money-order system is the 
net amount of fees received, after all losses have been deducted therefrom. 

An analysis of the money-order statement shows there were balances 
in the hands of postmasters eTune 30, 1904, amounting to $786,104.02, 
and there was due from former postmasters at that date $2,615.90, and 
due to former postmasters the sum of $36.18. During the Hscal year 
84,420 money orders were issued for the aggregate sum of $3,444,053.48, 
upon which fees were received amounting to $14,572.14. 

The number of ordei-s paid during the fiscal year was 43,748, aggre- 
gating $1,784,820.54. There was remitted to the United States for 
I retlit of the Philippine money-order system, on account of money orders 
of Philipiiine issue paid in the United States, the sum of $1,700,000. 
There was transferred to postal funds $15,023.23, and $5,136.41 was de- 
posited in the Insular Treasury on account of invalid money orders, for 
the credit of a pernuinent appropriation from which money orders re- 
maining unpaid more tlian one year from the last day of the month of 
issue are payable. 

There were balances in the hands of postmasters on June 30, 1905, 
aggregating $739,937.45. which sum includes the balances in the hands 
of the ])ostmaster at Manila as the designated depositary of money-order 
funds. There was due from former postmasters June 30, 1905, $2,427.91, 
while balances due former postmasters that date aggregated $36.18. 

Appended is a tabulated statement of the money-order transactions 
durino- the fiscal vear at each of the various money-order offices in the 
Islands and a statement of the general account with the United States. 

The account is stated entirely in United States currency, all transac- 
tions of the money-order system being so expressed.

REVISION OF THE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM. 



'riu» original accounting system in tlie Pliilippines was installed hy the . 
Annv while actually engaged in military operations. The system was 
necessarily erude, and intended only to meet temporarily the conditions 
as tliev arose. Later it became necessary to adopt and install a stable 
system. This was authorized in an executive order issued by President 
^IcKinlev, February 1001, and under it certain rules and regulations 
were issued by the Secretary of War, all of which were incorporated into 
a statute of the Philippine Commission and bivame known as Act 
Xo. 90. 

'i'he system thus defined was in reality the result of practical experience 
in Porto Rico and Cuba. It met the conditions in the Philippines most 
admirably, but no accounting system nuipped out 11.000 miles from the 
scene of its operation could be expected to be perfect in all of its details. 
Desirable amendments were made from time to time, and a complete 
revision has now been made as the result of recommendations of the 
Auditor, acting with a committee appointed by the Governor-General. 

A system of accounting which satisfactorily met unusual conditions in 
Porto Pico and Cuba, as well as the hard and unusual conditions which 
prevailed in the Philippine islands througli a period during which two 
currencies, with a frequently fluctuating ratio, were employed, could not 
be condemned and cast aside, and it was not with this spirit or purpose 
that the revision was undertaken. The real pur})ose Vas to incorporate 
into law those things which experience had shown to be desirable and to 
cast out those which had been found to be unnecessary or undesirable. 
The act became effective October 20, 11)05, but, as to the method of audit, 
was made retroactive from the beginning of the present fiscal year. 

The important changes brought about by the new Philippine Account- 
ing Act (Xo. 1402 of the Philippine Commission) are as follows: 

(1) The European method of audit is authorized, and under it sta- 
tistical results may be stated much earlier than under the old method. 

Under the European method of treatment the account is audited in 
all of its elements except as to the vouchers, which are temporarily ac- 
cepted at their face value. The accounts go to the books on this basis and 
show immediately two results for disbursement and revenue accounts, 
respectively, {a) the actual disbursements and (b) the reported collec- 
tions. The vouchers are then taken up in detail and given the same audit 

171 



172 REPORT OF THE AUDITOR 

as under the old system, and all items not then allowed are suspended or. 
"cliarged back" against the officer. If he succeeds in satisfving the de- 
mands of the audit so as to remove the charges, tlie book entries remain 
the same. If he does not so succeed, the disallowed disbursements are 
debited to him as i-efunds of expenditures, and tlie same net result as 
under the old system is readied. Collections not taken up are likewise 
charged in revenue accounts. 

(2) All collections subject to refund, such as joint Insular and pro- 
vincial collections, refundable export duties, etc.. will be divided before 
deposit. 

In other words, the general revenues from winch appropriations are 
to be made will not be inflated by amounts to be suijsequentlv refunded. 

Heretofore the Auditor has not been able to state definiteiv the amount 
in the Treasury actually available for appropriation. This was not due. 
to any fault of the accounting .system, but was due to legislation which 
provided that revenues belonging in part to the Insular Government and 
in part to the provinces, or refundable for some other purpose, should be 
deposited in the Treasury without deduction or segregation, it being 
proN-ided that the refunds should be made at a subsequent date, when all 
ot the facts upon which they are based have been ascertained. There 
ime been many propositions of this kind. The most recent one is the 
internal Kevenue Law. This law in its original form provided that all 

ne interna revenue collected throughout the Islands slioukl be deposited 
tne insular Treasury without segregation or deduction, and that at the 
Close ot each quarter the Auditor should refund to each province, pro 

aia according to population as shown by the last census. 25 per cent of 
the gross collections. 

1 he amount of refund due any province could not be determined until 

uei the complete settlement 6f the accounts of each quarter had been 

lacle and the distribution determined. This condition has been over- 
come in .sections 79, 80, and 81 of the new Accounting Act. Under this 

re^.i n.^f d«POsit«l in the Trea.surv and subject to 
ciuncl will be segregated in advance, and the general fund available for 
ppropriation will be stated separately. All future statements as to funds 

'Mailable for appropriation will therefore be net. 

ah r 1 '^1^^ ^<^ndition and settlement of accounts bv fiscal years has been 
ooiished, and for statistical purposes the date of 'payment will control. 
V-Teneral appropriations are made available until expended. 

Heretofore in the Philippines, as now in the United States, accounts 
ave been stated by fiscal years. A payment made has always been 
c larged to the fiscal year in which the obligation was contracted," regard- 
ess ot the date of payment, even if several years afterwards. This has 
required a great deal of paper work in separate accounting both to the 
disbursing officer and to the Auditor without accomplisliing any real re- 
sult. Under the fiscal-year system it is possible for a Bureau or Office to

make a large contract or purchase on practically the last day of the year, 
althou.£^h it is derniitely known that the articles purchased will not be con- 
sumed or utilized for months. The old method of charging such articles 
to the fiscal year in which contracted for is certainly as arbitrary as 
the new method of making the date of payment control for purposes of 
making the statistical charge. Where nonexpendable property is pur- 
chased to be used during a period of ensuing months or years, it is cer- 
tainly not essential that such purchase shall be charged to the particular 
iiscal year in which the contract was made. If the Government were 
doing business like a manufacturing enterprise, for the purpose of making 
a profit and declaring dividends, it would be desirable to distribute this 
cost throughout the period in which the articles purchased are expended 
or consumed, but it is impracticable for the Auditor to do this because it 
is a matter entirely within the knowledge and control of the various Bu- 
reaus and Offices. It was decided, therefore, that it was better that the 
date of payment should control so far as the st^itistical statements of 
expenditures are concerned. A disbursement will appear in the report 
of the Auditor for the year in which the money was actually paid out, 
regardless of the fiscal year in wliich the obligation was incurred. 

A system of provinciiil accountability is devised, giving to the 
provinces a greater degree of autonomy than heretofore enjoyed by them, 
while at the same time preserving sufiicient safeguards to secure uniform- 
ity of treatment of corresponding propositions throughout the provin(fial 
service. 

Sections 95 to 108, inclusive, of the Accounting Act provide for a 
sutficient number of district auditors to examine and settle the accounts 
of the provincial treasurers, each district auditor to be located in the 
district to which he is assigned. Each province constitutes, in fact, a 
separate local government, and to provide for each an auditor for pro- 
vincial purposes is analogous to providing an auditor for the Central 
Government. The work of the district auditors will he supervised and 
revised as indicated in the sections of the law cited, the Insular Auditor 
acting in the capacity of comptroller. 

When examining officers and accountable officers are brought into close 
and constant association the probability of collusion is increased. The 
history of all accounting proves this. The success of this scheme will 
therefore depend upon the ca])acity and character of the various district 
auditors. If they are capable and incorruptible, success will be obtained. 
Otherwise, the results may be unsatisfactory. 

The district auditors will also make such field examinations and counts 
of cash of Insular officials as may be directed from this office, and will 
become extremely valuable auxiliaries. The corps will give to the Au- 
ditor an agent in every locality to look into any matter which requires 
prompt investigation. • When it is shown that an Insular officer is with- 
holding deposits, "kiting," or is otherwise irregular, which facts are

usually clearly disclosed in his accounts, tiie district auditor will be. 
directed to inspect at once the office concerned and report results. In 
this 3«ay it is hoped to detect defalcations much more easily and quickly 
than heretofore. 

(5) Requisitions will be allowed and warrants. issued by the Auditor 
without reference to the Governor-General, and likewise postal drafts will 
be issued by the Auditor without the intervention of the Director of 
Posts. 

Under the old system the approved requisitions and certified settle- 
ments were forwarded to the office of the Governor-General, where the 
warrants were drawn. This system operated as a safeguard and made it 
extremely improbable that anyone would attempt to issue a fraudulent 
warrant. To place this function solely in the office of the Auditor is cer- 
tainly a compliment to its supposed integrity. 

There are many other features in the law which need not be alluded 
to specifically. The Auditor's jurisdiction is materially strengthened 
throughout. One feature in particular defines embezzlement and the 
jurisdiction and powers of the courts relative to crimes against the 
public funds. Every change which has seemed desirable as the result of 
practical experience here has been included in the act, which is a codifica- 
tion of all previous laws on the subject of accounting. The law, as a 
whole, is most admirable, and sufficiently elastic to make many future 
amendments unnecessary. 

It is the desire ajid purpose of the Auditor to hammer out of existence 
as rapidly as possible all unnecessary paper work; but no proposition 
which involves the safety of the Government's funds will be adopted. 
Proper checks and safeguards will be provided in all cases, 
llespectfully,
