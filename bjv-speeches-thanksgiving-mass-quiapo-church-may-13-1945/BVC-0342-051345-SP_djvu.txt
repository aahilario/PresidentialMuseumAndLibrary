MESSAGE OF HIS GRACE THE ARCHBISHOP OF 
MANILA TO THE CATHOLIC 
PARISHIONERS OF QUIAPO. 

Our first contacts with our native parish constitute for 
us a veritable reservoir of holy and happy memories which may 
easily influence the eatire leinainder of our lives. This influence is 
all the more inspiring and wholesome when it emanates from 
such a holy shrine as the sanctuary of Jesus Nazareno, in the 
parish church of Quiapo. 

Our first visit to parish church is usually to receive 

bipt.sm. and through this Sacrament, become primes of. the 

ingdom of Heaven. On that occasion we were adopted as 

J ldr '“ ot Then we were not aware of the great change

ARCHBISHOP OF MANILA 







Message of Rt.ReV. Mgr. Vicente Fernandez 
Parish Priest of Quiapo 



Manila, May 13, 1345 

Dear parishioners of Quiapo and pilgrims* \ 

# 9 

We are celebrating today a glorious event in 
the history, of our Parish, our thanksgiving act to 
Almighty God. It is inherent to the heart of the 
Filipino people to give thanks to His Creator, when- 
ever he receives any favor from Him, 

On this occasion I do not need to enumerate 
one by one the favors, benefits, and spiritual graces 
we have received from God. Recall only on your 
mind that we have survived from all atrocities and 
savage vaudaliem of a pagan nation, and were saved 
from the claws of a nation that attempted to anni- 
hilate our race torturing it starving and causing a 
slow but sure death, you will be convinced that the 
Hand of God is always protecting us from all dan- 
gers. 

; By our liberation made by America with the 
help of God, we have sufficient reason to thank God 
and to acknowledge humbly to Him this favor. Our 
hardships have ended and we are enjoying a new natio- 
nal life. 

How can we worthily thunk God for so many 
a favor abundantly poured on us. The only means to 
thank Him is to go on with our prayers, our Com- 
munions and other good works, in a word to be a good 
practical Catholic- 

Mons. VICENTE FERNANDEZ, 

Parish Priest of Quiapo, Manila

Message of the Hon. Tomas Confesor, 



Secretary of the Interior 



For the first time in the history of Manila, 
since January 2, 1942, you, fellow countrymen of 
Quiapo, are given the opportunity to live in an 
atmosphere every atem of which carries the spirit 
of democracy and liberty. 

This cance is brought about by the coming of 
our friends the Americans, under the ablest General 
of the Army in the Pacific, Douglas McArthur, 
Liberator of the Philippines. 

, It is, indeed, to state that the liberation of our 
City hag occasioned cold-blooded massacres and great 



destruction of property, committed by a savage foe. 
Wa are just emerging from a period of black sorrow and 
chaos. But have faith. As Paul the Apostle said, 
Tne sufferings of the present time are not worthy to 
be compared with the glory that shall be revealed 



in us.

Secretary of the interior

Message of the Hon. Maximo Kalaw , 
Secretary of Public Instruction 
and Information 



I have learned that the people of Manila spe 
daily' those living in Quiapo and surrounding districts 
are planning a big Thanksgiving celebration dedicated 
to the Holy Nazareno, Patron Saint of Quiapo, aud 
to the Nuestra Sefiora de, la Paz y Buen Viaje, Pa- 
tron Saint of the holy Autipolo shrine. 

' I join our people heart and soul, in their 
fervent expressions of religious thanksgiving. When 
one remembers the mass massacres committed by the 
unbelieving Japanese herder, the nameless crimes 
oerpetuated by them against our women and children 
and against innocent and defenseless civilians, the 
horrible tortures and slow death administered without 
the least mercy upon the unsuspecting, it is surprising 
that we are still living. It, therefore, behooves us, 
survivors of the holocaust, to express in a most 
patent way our thanks and gratitude to HIM who 
rules human destiny that HE has chosen to spare 
our lives and to our beloved Patron Saints who 
steadfastly stood by us in tha darkest moments of 
our sufferings. - MAXIMO M. KALAW

Message of the Hon. Delfin Jaranilla 
Secretary of Justice 



Whatever we had gone through during the 
darkest days of our redemption or liberation was a 
raminder of the Spirit of God. No one can say 
that God, Our Lord, was not our merciful Saviour, 
as no one else could have saved us from the deadly 
whistling bullets and shrapnels coming from various 
directions. Cod, our Creator, is the giver of irresis- 
tible Strength and King of irresistible power. He 
held in check the power of the enemy and had over- 
come him, who was fiercely going about worse than 
a roaring beast. We must not forget Him and ba 
thankful to Him; and we must pray and beseech 
our Lord specially in the hours of danger and in 
the most trying condition. 



DELFIN JARANILLA 





Message of the Hon. Tomas Cabili, Secretary 
of National Defense 



I am thrilled at the opportunity of taking a 
humble part in this beautiful act of Thanksgiving 
which you are observing today. 



This congregation, wherein Filipinos from all 
walks of life take part, imbued withdeep religious 
fervor, bespeaks the true character of our people, 
the only Christian nation in the Orient One -of the 
outstanding traits of our people is gratitude. A 
common tac is grateful to the end of his life for 
a favor received and he shows it continuously in 
various ways. That is practically a tradition among 
our common people in the fields and in the barrios, 
and it is a beautiful one. 



We have been bountifully blessed compared to 
other nations. The ravages of war in the Philippines 
while tremendous are small when we contemplate of 
the peace and freedom we now enjoy. 



Let our hearts and souls turn to God Who 
is the fountain of all blessings and entreat Him to 
continue to extend to us His protecting wings. 

(Sgd.) TOMAS L, CABILI
