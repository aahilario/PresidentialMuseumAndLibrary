QUEZON and OSMENA: 

Their Last Battle 



by FREDERIC S. MARQUAKDT 



• MANUEL L. Quezon and Sergio 
Osmena formed the most enduring 
partnership in Philippine history. For 
more than a quarter of a century they 
directed the political campaign for 
Philippine independence. As the 
United States extended greater and 
greater authority to the Filipinos, Que- 
zon and Osmena used it to build a 
new ship of state, It is an ironic 
twist of fate that Quezon didn't live 
to see the ship launched, while Os- 
mena was not privileged to stand at 
the rudder during the launching. 

Both of these architects of Philip- 
pine independence were born in 
1878: Quezon on August 19; Osme- 
ita on September 9 Both were elect- 
ed to the First Philippine Assembly 
in 1907: Osmena became speaker; 
Quezon was made majority party floor 
leader. When the Philippine Senate 
was constituted under the Jones Act, 
Quezon became its president, Osmena 
majority floor leader. In the auto- 
nomous Philippine Commonwealth, 
Quezon was president, Osmena was 
vice-president. 

Throughout the American regime 
these two Filipinos dominated Phil- 
ippine politics. They complemented 
each other perfectly.' The explosive, 
Latin-tempered Quezon was an ideal 
foil for the even-handed, Oriental- 
minded Osmena. They had their dif- 
ferences, but usually kept them to 
themselves, There were some notable 
exceptions, such as unipersonalism in 
government and the advisability of 
rejecting the Hare-Hawes-Cutting in- 
dependence law in the hope of get- 
ting something better. 

Quezon won both those fights. He 
convinced the Nacionalista Consoli- 
dado Party it should .give up the con- 
cept of unipersonalism, and then 
gathered to himself- all the power he 
could lay his hands on. He persuaded 
the legislature it should kill the Hare- 
Hawes-Cutting independence law,

Joaquin M. Elizalde, Basilio J* V aides, and 
Ariuro B* Rotor, 



and then secured approval of the Ty- 
dings-McDuffie Act, virtually a car- 
bon copy. 

Their 'last battle could easily have 
disrupted the Quezon-Osmena part- 
nership, and might have seriously af- 
fected the Philippine war effort in 
World War II. But Quezon and Os- 
mena settled their differences private- 
ly and presented a united front to the 
world. 

That was just 10 years ago. The 
issue was fought out in Washington, 
where Quezon and Osmena headed 
the Philippine government in exile. 
The story is little known in the Phil- 
ippines, which was under Japanese oc- 
cupation at the time. It is specially 
pertinent in this election year of 1953, 

The question involved presidential 



tenure of office. Then, as now, the 
Philippine Constitution provided no 
man could hold the presidency for 
more than eight successive years. Que- 
zon had been sworn in as president 
on November 15, 1935. His eight 
years would be up on November 15, 
1943. According to the constitution; 
Osmena was due to become president 
on that date. 

But few men willingly yield politi- 
cal power. Quezon wanted to retain 
his high office. There were some 
strong arguments on his side. He 
was a symbol of Filipino resistance 
to the Japanese, He was far better 
known than Osmena, in the United 
States and throughout the world. If 
he were replaced as president, the 
constitutional issue would be lost sight 



of. The Japanese would claim that 
the United States had double-crossed 
a loyal friend. Foreign nations might 
think that Quezon had removed him- 
self from office as a protest against 
America's policy of Europe-First in- 
stead of Asia-First in fighting the war. 

On the other hand, Osmena knew 
that the office legally belonged to 
him. He felt capable of doing the 
job. And he believed profoundly in 
a government of law, not of men. 
One breach of the constitution could 
lead to another. This, he reasoned, 
would be a good time to show that 
even in moments of grave emergency 
the Filipinos could live under and 
* abide by tjie laws they themselves had 
made.

QUEZON AND OSMENA; * * , 

(Continued from page 25) 
In the end, as was usually the case, 
Quezon's will prevailed- Osmena was 
ready to sacrifice personal ambition 
to the national welfare. The old 
working partnership was reestablished 
and the two men petitioned congress 
to set aside the Philippine constitu- 
tion, 

Thus it was that the Congress of the 
United States passed a bill providing 
that the president and vice-president 
of the Philippine Commonwealth now 
serving should continue in office un- 
til the United States president pro- 
claimed that constitutional processes 
had been restored in the Philippines, 
President Roosevelt signed the bill 
into law on Nov, 12, 1943, 

In view of charges of American in- 
tervention in the current elections, it 
is interesting to note that 1943 was 
one year in which the United States 
did actually determine who would be 
president of the Philippines, But it 
was done on the written petition of 
the executive heads of the Philippine 
government t and it met considerable 
opposition in the United States, In 
his definitive work, "First Malayan Re- 
public" (published in 1951), George 
A, Malcolm called congress' action 
"constitutionally indefensible/' 

Quezon's Story 

I visited Washington shortly there- 
after, and had long interviews with 
both Quezon and Osmena, the for- 
mer in his lavish suite in the Shore- 
ham Hotel, the latter in his modest 
apartment in the Twenty- Four Hun- 
dred Hotel. Each told me his side of 
the story, and I still have the notes 
I made immediately after the inter- 
view. They reveal a story which has 
never been fully told before. 

My interview with Quezon was on 
Thanksgiving Day, November 25, The 
president was propped up in bed t and 
his frail body was frequently wracked 
by coughing speljs induced by the 
tuberculosis which was to result in 
his death less than a year later. 

I took the opportunity to congra- 
tulate him on the way the Filipino 
government in exile had worked out 
its problem. I pointed out how sharp- 
ly this contrasted with the bitterness 
shown between De Gaulle and Gi- 
raud in the Free French government- 

"Vice-President Osmena and I 
agreed to settle the issue between our- 
selves last May," Quezon said. "Pres- 
ident Roosevelt told me he wanted 
me to remain as president after Nov- 
ember 15, I asked him not to take 
any action without consulting Osme- 
na." 

Quezon's opinion was that the Phil- 
ippine Constitution was not operative, 
since the Tydings-McDuffie Act pro- 
vided that the President should have 
authority in the Philippines, and ob- 
viously he had none there, "I am the 
president of half a dozen men, not 
of the Philippines," Quezon said laugh- 
ingly. 

Judge Sam Roseman, one of Roose- 
velt's aides, tried to bring the matter 
to a head. After talking with both of 
the Filipino leaders, he drafted a let- 
ter to congress which he hoped they 
would sign. Over the phone he told 
Quezon that Osmena had agreed to 
sign. But Quezon objected. He didn't 
want to be in the position of a sup- 
pliant. Secretar) of War Stimson, 



former governor general of the Phil- 
ippines, tried to persuade Quezon, 
Here's how Quezon described the in- 
cident: 

"Stimson came in and showed me 
the letter and asked me to sign it* 
I said I couldn't He said, 'That's 
your Spanish pride, Don Manuel/ 1 
said it wasn't a matter of pride but 
one of dignity. I wasn't a job-seeker, 
and never had been, I wasn't going 
to sign a letter to congress now beg- 
ging for a job. 

"Then Stimson said, 'I'm asking you 
to sign that letter because we need 
you in the war effort, and we need 
you at the head of the government. 
It's your duty/ 

"So I said, 'Then 111 sign it I 
have- never yet failed in my patriotic 
duty, If Osmena will sign it, I will/ 

"So I thought it was all settled, but 
that afternoon Osmena came and said 
he couldn't sign the letter and he 
didn't think I should/' 

According to Quezon, Roseman call- 
ed him up and said, "What's the mat- 
ter with you fellows? When Osmeiia 
wants to sign, you don't. And when 
you want to sign, he doesn't/' 

Quezon went on with his story, ges- 
ticulating dramatically in his sickbed. 
"So I called a meeting of the cabinet, 
and told them I had agreed to sign 
the request to congress because the 
secretary of war said it was my duty. 
However, Sergio wouldn't sign it. 

"Then I said, 'Gentlemen, Fm 
through/ I turned to Hernandez , 
(Jaime Hernandez, secretary of fin- 
ance) and said, 'Fix up a complete 
financial report for my entire term 
of office/ Then I said, 'Rotor (Ar- 
turo B. Rotor, private secretary), get 
all my papers for me/ And then to 
all of them I said, I'm leaving on 
the 14th/" 

Quezon smiled as he concluded, 
"Osmena came over quickly and said

he'd sign the paper. That's how it 
happened." 

Vice-President OsmenVs account 
was a little different. He gave it to 
me on Saturday^ November 27, at 
the Twenty-Four Hundred Hotel He, 
too, had talked with Secretary of 
War Stimson, who said that "the one 
great aim of the United States was 
to recapfure the Philippines and give 
the Filipinos their real independence." 

Osmena continued: "Stimson said 
that in defeating Japan the United 
States would need the help of the 
Filipinos, all of them, and that he 
hoped President Quezon and I 
wouM both be able to help, and not 
just one of us, as would happen if 
Quezon were to be replaced by me as 
president. I told him I was anxious 
for unity too, but that there were cer- 
tain legal obstacles to be considered. 
He said the method of settling the 
issue could be left to the legalists. 
But he emphasized that two men 
were essential in the reconquest of 
the Philippines — Mac Arthur and 
Quezon. 



"Otje day," said Osmena, "Quezon 
called me to the Shoreham and said, 
'Well, they're going to throw me out 
into the street.* I told him I had no 
intention of throwing him out. I said 
I had long since told mutual ac- 
quaintances that if I should become 
president I would make Mr. Quezon 
head of a council of state and ask 
him to stay at die Shoreham with all 
the perquisites of his present office. 
I didn't want to move into that big 
suite. This place is fine for me." 

Dramatic Meeting 

After his talks with Stimson, Que- 
zon, and others, Osmena decided he 
would sign the petition to congress if 
he could get a letter from President 
Roosevelt asking him to do so. When 
he went to the dramatic cabinet meet- 
ing Quezon had described to me, Os- 
mena thought Quezon had a request 
from Roosevelt. t On learning Roose- 
velt hadn't put his request in writing, 
Osmena said he couldn't sign the let- 
ter. 

"President Quezon spoke- to us at 
some length, lying there in his bed/' 
said Osmena, **He asked me if I 



wanted to be heard, and I presented 
my side of the case. Then he called 
on Hernandez, who said, 'This is a 
very vital matter and I would like a 
little time to think it over/ 

"Then Mr. Quezon said, 'Well, I 
see the cabinet is divided, In that 
case, my decision is made. I have 
rented a house in California and I 
shall leave here on November 14, Mr. 
Osmena will become president on the 
15th. This is the final cabinet meet- 
ing. It s good-bye to you all/ 

"They all walked out, and I walked 
to the elevator with them. Then I 
returned to the . president s bedroom 
and told him I wanted to think things 
over and I would see him m the 
morning, I thought he might change 
his mind. But when I saw him the 
next day, he was as determined as 
ever, 

" Tni disgusted with it and I'll have 
no more to do with it/ Mr. Quezon 
said. 

u 'Does that stop me from settling 
the case?* I asked him. 

"'No, you go ahead and do what 
you like/ he said.

" TH promise that/ Quezon said, 
'You can do anything you like* I'll

Now on his own, Osmena decided 
to consult Sen. Millard E, Tydings, 
head of the senate committee on in- 
sular affairs and author of the Phil- 
ippine Independence Act, Osmena 
and Tydings discussed the matter at 
length, and Tydings assured him con- 
gress would not intervene except at 
the direct request of Quezon and Os- 
mena. Bowing to the inevitable, Os- 
mena went to work on the draft of 
a letter to congress in which he volun- 
tarily relinquished his legally-estab- 
lished right; to the presidency. Ty- 
dings helped polish die letter. Os- 
mena took it to the cabinet, which 
approved it. Then he took it to Que- 
zon, who promptly signed. 

Thus the Japanese were robbed of 
a potentially powerful propaganda 
weapon. And history was given an 
example of how Filipino leaders can 
work together when necessity arises 
and when they are of the stature of 
Manuel Quezon and Sergio Osmena,

MO DESTO D. Bantola, chief pho-

information office, used to accompa- 
ny the late President Quezon in his 
trips to the provinces. The incidents 
described below and the pictures ac- 
companying this article come from 
him. 

Once the late President arid then 
Major Rafael Jalandoni went to a bar- 
rio of Caisigtiranj Tayabas, near Baler, 
The President had to be carried ashore 
by four stu rdy natives. As the Pres- 
ident i -each led the shore, nearly all 
the natives (dumagats) ran off in dif- 
ferent directions. He called the bar- 
rio lieu tenant and the school teachers 
and toM them to assemble all the 
people in the schoolhouse. 

When all the barrio folks had ga- 
thered on the; school ground, he ad- 
dressed them in fluent Tagalog: at How 
can I determine your needs If you 
run from me, as if I were a monster? 
I hav*e come here to help you, not 
to scare you. We are all Filipinos 
and provincemates at that. . *

te" s*x>n rent \\he dir. To prove his 



friendship, he distributed money to

There was also the time whej? 
President Quezon motored to San 
Fernando, Pampanga, upon the invi- 
tation of the late Pedro Abad Santos. 
He was to hear the demands of the 
tenants for better reforms. The late 
Jose Abad Santos, secretary of justice 
and brother of the peasant leader, ac- 
companied him. 

Pedro Abad Santos first addressed 
the crowd in Pampango. Near the 
middle of the speech, Pres. Quezon 
noted that the people were restless, 
So he asked Justice Abad Santos who 
was sitting beside him what his bro- 
ther was saying. The late justice told 
him that his brother was exhorting 
the people to ask for reforms from the 
government. The President at once 
stood up and told the people in sim- 
ple language about his social- justice 
program. 

In the course of his campaign for 
the presidency, Quezon went to Ca- 
lapan, Mindorou

FIGHT TO THE FINISH 



After tlie Perez-Lopez "war 1 * is over - and the end seems not yet 
in sight - one of the combatants may find himself politically weakened, 

if not dead. • - V , < 

The curly-haired little man from San Carlos, Pangasinan, has 
repeatedly announced that he will not stop lambasting the "vested 
interests" until their representatives, whom he recently identified as 
Vice-President Lopez and his brother, Eugenio, are neutralized and 
completely without influence in the halls of Congress. The Speaker 
blames the two brothers for the eleventh hour move in the House 
to oust him from the Speakership during the special session. Because 
of the resulting confusion and disturbance caused by "vested inter- 
ests,*' the congressmen could not take up, much less deliberate upon, 
the pending educational measure, Perez has repeatedly declared in 
public pronouncements and press releases. 

But Senator Pecson - one of the authors of the bill — has publicly 
declared, on more than one occasion, that she knew the exact reason 
for the refusal of the House to take up the measure in question. She 
said that the proposed law was tabled "in order to punish me for 
not voting in favor of the confirmation of Under-Secretary of Justice 
Roberto Gianzoris appointment in the commission on appointments " 
Vice-President Lopez is generally known to be a man of serene 
disposition. This was shown by the fact that notwithstanding the 
Speakers continuous verbal barrage for almost two weeks following 



the close of the special congressional meet, he (the Veep) did his 
level best to control his temper. Instead of actin" on the importunings 
of friends and political followers to lash out at Perez, the Vice-Pres- 
ident remained quiet. 

But Perez' unrelenting attacks must have taxed Lopez* patience. 
For finally last week, in Hollo, he accepted the Speaker s challenge 
and announced that he was prepared to fight Perez to the bitter end, 
regardless of the consequences. (See page 5.) 

This "war" between two pillars of the ruling political party is 
worrying many Liberals these days. Deep in their hearts, they know 
that as me determined "swordsmen" continue to lunge at each other, 
one of them is going to get hurt in the end. The Perez-Lopez duel 
will close with the political annihilation of one of the protagonists, it 
is feared by Liberals, and die effect on the party will, in no way be 
salutary, in so far as the coming presidential election is concerned. 

Meanwhile, as the fight continues, President Quirino sits calmly 
watching. People can only conjecture what s in the back of the Apo s 
^jind. A Liberal says that '"it will not grieve the President to see Perez 
defeated because after all he has been nurturing presidential ambi- 
tions ..and Quirino does not like it." But if Lopez "slays" Perez, 
the latter s loval supporters in the party will fight tooth and nail to 
prevent the Veeps nomination for reelection in 1953.

TWO CHEERS 
FOR DEMOCRACY 

The Moderation of Man 



m THE Reign of Victoria, that prim 
and fanatically correct age, produced, 
strangely enough, such figures of pas- 
sionate controversy as Charles Dar- 
win, Herbert Spencer and Karl Marx. 
Darwin saw all life as an evolutionary 
process, a process of natural selection 
resulting in the survival of the fittest. 
Spencer married Darwin to the Utili- 
tarians and came to the conclusion 
that if man were left to his own de- 
vices, however dubious, the greatest 
good would result to the greatest 
number, Marx thought that money 
was the root of all evil, not man. Take 
away his money and there would be 
nothing the matter with man. 

Nothing, surely 3 could have been 
more anti-Victorian than the views of 
the three, Darwin shook the com- 
placency of the age; he scandalized 
his contemporaries who thought that 
man had reached perfection in them; 
Victorian man, in Darwin's theory, 
was only a step on the way; God did 
not rest with his production; the pro- 
cess was going, humiliatingly, on. As 
for Spencer, to have anything to do 
with Darwin, to try to justify the 
capitalist system by citing On the Ori- 
gin of Species was something simply 
not done. Marx, of course, was a 
crude outsider, a bounder. 

Yet they were all, in this, entirely 
Victorian: they all took a cheerful 
view of man. God's in Ins heaven, as 
Browning put it; alls right with the 
world. 

As it happens, they were all wrong. 

Two world wars have shaken the 
easy faith in the "inevitability of pro- 
gress/' AlFs wrong with the world. 
And what's wrong with the world is 
man, Man is not good. With or 



without money. Take away his mon- 
ey and you still can't trust him, as 
Marx would have you do. (The com- 
munist dictatorship in Russia proves 
this.) Marx was wrung. So was 
Spencer, Given money and left com- 
pletely alone, man made of merry 
England an industrial hell. Enter- 
prise, when unregulated, led not to 
the greatest good for the greatest num- 
ber, but to child labor, Darwin, too, 
was wrong. Progress is not necessa- 
rily upward. After its atomic wars, 
what %vil) remain of the human race 
may be hideous mutations, howling 
monstrosities; sad-eyed sub-men may 
mock, without knowing, the relative- 
ly recent faith in the survival of the 
fittest. 

Man is the root of all evil, and what 



The moderation of man, then, 
should be the aim of all governments, 
He must be kept under restraint. Phy- 
sically a reed, he is, however, "a think- 
ing reed." He can dam rivers and 
move mountains and weigh the stars. 
He is the most terrible force let loose 
upon the earth; he is usually not a 
force for^ood. He partakes almost 
of the character of nature; blind and 
powerful, the earth quakes and kills 
without discrimination, not distin- 
guishing between the wicked and the 
just. The river rises and drowns the 
guilty and *the innocent. Man is 
equally irresponsible. 

The Christian conception of man 
as a fallen spirit, not an evolving one, 
is supported by the record, Man's 
nature is flawed, not his environment.

makes him turn to evil is not money 
but power, of which money is only 
an agent. Men would give what, they 
have to the poor, as Christ would 
have them, if they could but com- 
mand and rule. There have been 
ascetic tyrants. The needs o£ the body 
are quickly filled. A man can eat 
only so much, have only one roof 
over his head at a time, wear only one 
suit. But there is no satisfying the 
desire for power. There is no end 
to that. Today, power over one's 
country, tomorrow, over the world, 
the day after tomorrow, the universe, 
and after that, the galaxies . , . Before 
that, of course, the lunatic asylum, 
Man must be lord over all. 



And modern psychology confirms it. 
Freud saw the inner life of man as 
a journey through chaos, a subterra- 
nean passage through hell. His sub- 
conscious is a world of murder, rape 
and rapine, with only a feeble censor 
restraining his savage drives. The 
beast must be chained. 

Democracy is an attempt to hold 
in check that which fascism unleashed 
and communism justifies, Power is 
'kept relative, being carefully divided 
among the executive, the judiciary and 
the legislative. No man is all-power- 
ful so that all men may be safe. Plato 
dreamed of a philosopher king who 
would rule wisely because he would 
be without vanity, but he set up no 



guarantees against a foolish king suc- 
ceeding a wise one* The ideal ruler 
is a benevolent despot; he could do 
the most good to the greatest number 
in the quickest time. No constitution* 
al limitations would delay his bene- 
volent impulses. But the destruction 
of the Roman republic produced Nero 
and Caligula. It is less than wisdom 
to think you could restrain men by 
giving all powers to one. 

Because it offers no absolutes, be- 
cause it promises no paradise on earth 
to replace the paradise that was lost; 
because it does not aim at perfection 
but at compromise; because it would 
have men become not as gods but as 
men, as human beings, led by justice, 
charity and truth; because its ambi- 
tions are modest and within reach; 
because it is common, vulgar and un- 
remarkable; because it is humble — 
democracy does not always arouse en- 
thusiasm; it fires no fanatics. But it 
is, after all, the best of all govern- 
ments. It would restrain men by giv- 
ing all power — to none. It is the pro- 
per government for man. 

The lure of the perfect, the abso- 
lute, leads t6 all sorts of abuses, to 
persecution, torture and death. The 
communists are persuaded that their 
triumph would establish a classless 
society. In such a society, there would 
be no crime, therefore, no police. No 
man would rob if all men have what 
they want. It would be a paradise 
on earth — justifying the establish- 
in ent ? meanwhile, of concentration 
camps. For it is not enough for com- 
munism to triumph; the triumph must 
be complete. The opposition must 
not only be defeated, it must be en- 
tirely crushed. Absolute victory calls

"Emergency powers would tend to kindle emergencies.*' 

THE BALANCE OF POWER 



• WHEN it rested on England to 
keep the peace in Europe, she put 
her trust in the balance of power. 
While no nation was too strong, all 
nations were safe. She watched every 
new combination of powers, then, with 
a careful eye, seeing in every unusual 
concentration of strengdi a threat to 
peace. The balance of power must 
be preserved, if necessary through the 
application of English force. 

In a democracy, the equal appor- 
tionment of power among the three 
branches of the government is the 
mainstay of the individuals liberties. 
When the executive encroaches on 
the legislative, democracy is no long- 
er safe. He who executes the laws 
must not also pass them. The legis- 
lature passes the laws, the executive 
carries them out, the judiciary inter- 
prets them. Confronted with a bad 
law, the court may not follow justice 
rather than the law; that would be 
to legislate; the court must decide ac- 
cording to the law. Its amendment 
or repeal belongs to the legislature. 
Nor may the executive act where the 
legislature has failed; the executive 
may recommend, it must cany out, 
but it cannot enact. The balance of 
power must be maintained. 

In the Philippines] as President Qui- 
rino continues to claim powers clear- 
ly not his, the balance has been badly 
upset. The President has, in effect, 
constituted himself the Congress of 
the Philippines. This is as much the 
fault of congressmen as of the Pres- 
ident. There are not enough of the 
former, with enough principles or 
spirit, to put the latter in his place. 

Between the invasion of Poland in 
1939 and Pearl Harbor, seven laws 



were passed vesting the President 
with extraordinary powers to meet the 
international crisis. Commonwealth 
Act No. 494 authorized him to sus- 
pend the Eight-Hour Labor Law, 
Commonwealdi Act No. 496 to take 
over any public service or enterprise, 
Commonwealth Act No. 498 to fix 
the price ceiling for certain commo- 
dities, and so on. All the acts vested 
the President with law-making pow- 
ers until the adjournment of the next 
regular session of the National Assem- 
bly* For a limited period, in other 
words, as the Constitution provides. 

On Dec. 16, 1951, as the Japanese 
converged on Manila, the National 
Assembly, meeting in the basement 
of the Legislative Building, passed 
Commonwealth Act No. 671, delegat- 
ing practically all its powers to the 
President. Wrote' President Quezon 
of the delegation in his book. The 
Good Fight: 

"When it became evident that we 
were completely helpless against air 
attack and that it was most unlikely 
the Philippine Legislature would hold 
its regular session which was to open 
on January 1, 1942, the National As- 
sembly . . . enacted a law granting the 
President of the Philippines all the 
powers that under the Philippine Con- 
stitution may be delegated to him in 
time of war. The Act was only for 
a certain period and would become 
invalid unless reenacted." 

The act was not only never reenact- 
ed, Congress (as the National Assem- 
bly later came to be known) repealed 
it. There was no need for the re- 
peal, but the stubborn claim of ano- 
ther President that the emergency 
powers were indefinitely his forced 



the hand of Congress. The act was 
repealed. The President vetoed the 
repeal. 

The National Assembly delegated 
its powers to President Quezon in 
1941, not because there was a war 
but because certain measures might 
be required to meet the emergen ex- 
while the National Assembly could 
not meet. The National Assembly 
authorized President Quezon to act 
in its place. That was in 1941. Pres- 
ided Quezon is now dead. Since 
1945, Congress has been meeting reg- 
ularly. In 1949, Four years after 
World War II had been brought to 
a victorious conclusion with the defeat 
of Japan, another President, Elpidio 
Quirino, took it upon himself to act 
in place of Congress, issued Execu- 
tive Order No. 192, controlling ex- 



ports from the Philippines, Executive 
Order No. 225, appropriating funds 
for the operation of the government 
from July 1949 to June 30, 1950, and 
Executive Order No. 226, appropriat- 
ing the sura of P6,000,000 to pay the 
expenses of the 1949 elections. Con- 
gress, for all practical purposes, ceased 
to exist. 

When Congress passed the Zosa 
Bill formally repealing the emergen- 
cy powers act, with only one dissent- 
ing vote in the Senate, President Qui- 
rino vetoed, as we have said, the re- 
peal. With the present composition 
of the House, Congress cannot hope 
to override the presidential veto and 
must stand helplessly by as President 
Quirino continues to assume its func- 
tion and exercise congressional pow-

QUEZON MEMORIAL FOUNDATION I 



• AS the Filipinos observe the 74th 
birthday anniversary of the late Pres- 
ident Quezon next Tuesday, August 
19, they will perhaps be wondering 
about the Quezon Memorial fund 
drive which has been going on for the 
last seven years. The nation-wide 
campaign was initiated by former 
President Osmena and boosted suc- 
cessively by the late President Roxas 
and President Quirino. Seven years 
seem like a pretty long time for a 
campaign for funds, and the end is 
not in sight. It makes people won- 
der, if not suspicious. How much in 
l lie form of "voluntary* contributions 
has been collected so far? What 
is being done about the money? How 
many more years are needed to wind 
up the campaign? Or, will the drive 
never end? 

These are some of the questions 
people are asking about the Quezon 
Memorial Foundation which, after se- 
ven long years, is still mostly on paper. 
It will be recalled that the presiden- 
tial proclamation issued by Osmena 
on December 17, 1945, set the goal 
for the campaign at P250,000. The 
id$a at that time was to erect only 
a national monument for the departed 
leader and the amount of P250,000 
was believed sufficient for the pur- 
pose. 

When the late President Roxas took 
over, however, he thought that the 
amount was too small for a memorial 
"to perpetuate the memory of Quezon 
in the hearts of his countrymen." He 
decided that the memorial should in- 
clude a magnificent building to house 
an impressive statue of Quezon, be- 
sides a Quezonian library and museum, 
a gallery of Philippine national heroes, 
and an international assembly hall. In 
keeping with this change in the plans, 
Roxas hiked the campaign goal from 
P250,000 to P3,000,000. 

The national fund campaign was 
placed in the hands of a Quezon Me- 
morial Committee. The original com- 
mittee was composed of- the follow- 
ing: Alfredo Montelibano, then sec-

Gil Puyat, members. Pedro Hernaez, 
then a senator, was designated treas- 
urer, and Artemio Nabor, executive 
secretary. 

The campaign started rather slow- 
ly, as the planning alone took monlhs. 
Total collections for the first year, 
1946, amounted to F58,044.08. But 




PEDRO TAN 



replaced by Dr. Velasco, who bore the 
new designation of campaign manager. 
Chairman Montelibano was replaced 
by the new Secretary of Interior, 
Jose Zulueta. As collections mounted, 
custody of the funds was placed in 
the hands of the national treasurer. 

The new campaign manager had 
ambitious plans for stepping up the 
drive. He adopted some of the pro- 
paganda stunts of the Franklin D. 
Roosevelt Memorial Foundation and 
operational expenses rose. But the 
collections seemed to justify the ex- 
penses. However, Chairman Zulueta 
did not seem to approve of the heavy 
expenses and this started a cleavage 
between the chairman and the cam- 
paign manager. 

The unfortunate rift between Zu- 
lueta and Velasco became worse when 
political lame ducks were placed on 
the pay roll of the committee. Not- 
able among these were two former 
provincial governors who were desig- 
nated campaign supervisors with a 
monthly salary of P500 each, plus 
transportation expenses. In effect, the 
campaign supervisors, who were sup- 
posed to be under the campaign man- 
ager, were receiving higher pay than 
the campaign manager himself. In- 
censed, Velasco contested the author- 
ity of the chairman to make the ap- 
pointments. 

Offshoot of the quarrel was the fil- 
ing of 16 specific* charges against Ve- 
lasco by a henchman of Zulueta. Ap- 
parently, however, many of the char- 
ges did not hold water and were drop- 
ped.' But, because of the charges, Ve- 
lasco was suspended. The charges 
as the drive gained momentum, col- were duly investigated and even the 
lections picked up considerably. The National Bureau of Investigation took

roll in. instatement of Velasco as campaign 
Meanwhile, there was a reshuffle manager did not achieve the desired 
in the personnel of the committee, effect of patching up the quarrel be- 
Nabor, the executive secretary, was tween him and the chairman. 

About the middle of 1948, Velasco 
was replaced by Ciriaco Raval. In 
September of that year Zulueta him- 
self was succeeded as chairman by 
Sotero Baluyut wfth his appointment 
as Secretary of Interior. In spite of 
the quarrel between Zulueta and Ve- 
lasco, the collection for the stormv 
year (1948) amounted to more than 
P130,000. After deducting the ex- 
penses, the net collection for the year 
was F9L046.60, expenses amounting 
to over F40,000. 

It may be mentioned in passing 
that the Quezon Memorial Fund cof- 
lected more during the first two and 
one-half years that the campaign was 
handled jointly by Chairman Zulueta 
and Campaign Manager Velasco than 
during the last four years when the 
conduct of the drive was in the hands 
of Baluyut and Campaign Managers

Ciriaco Raval, Pedro Reyes, and Pe- 
dro Tan, Prior to Baluyut's assump- 
tion of the committee chairmanship, 
the" fund amounted to F343, 060.41, 
This represents the net collections for 
1946, 1947, and the first seven months 
of 1948* Tire total collection since 
Baluyut became chairman of the com- 
mittee in September, 1948, amounts 
to only F255,212.45. 

Decline 

Cash on hand as per last report of 
National Treasurer Vicente G, Gelk, 
who is also the official custodian of 
the Quezon Memorial Fund, amounts 
to F598,272.86. The funds are de- 
posited among various banking insti- 
tutions as follows: Philippine National 
Bank (savings account), P10 ; 566.66j 
as current account in the same bank, 
PI 19,609. 87; Philippine Bank of 
Commerce, P207,019.20; Bank of the 
Philippine Islands, F259,975.58; and 
the cash on hand with the commit- 
tee's disbursing officer, F 1,101.55. 

From the foregoing figures, it can 
be seen that the committee is still a 
long, long way from the goal of 
P3 ,000,000. Collections appear to be 
on the decline. In 1949, the commit- 
tee made P70.675.07, The following

were heavy, the returns in increased 
collections more than justified them. 

About the only accomplishments of 
Baluyut and Tan since* tfiey took over 
the conduct of the campaign more 
than four years ago was the laying 
of the cornerstone of the memorial or 
foundation on August 19, 1949, The 
nation-wide contest for the design of 
the memorial conducted last year could 
not even be called an achievement at 
alL Even up to the present, the mess 
still smells to high heaven. 

Protests 

i 

For 'winning" the first prize in that 
contest Federico Ilustre, former busi- 
ness associate of Baluyut, was given a 
cash award of PI 0,000. The second 
and third prize winners deferred ac- 
ceptance of their prizes amounting to 
F5,000 and P3,000, respectively, and 
joined other competitors in protest- 
ing against the conduct of the con^ 
test. Among other things, they want- 
ed to know the following: (a) why 
the committee did not want to fur- 
nish each of the competitors with a 
copy of the jury's report until after 
the winners were announced; (b) why 
Ilustre's entry was removed after it 
was placed on exhibition; (c) why 
the winning design was returned to 
its designer for "modification"; and 
(d) why the winning design was 
placed on exhibition only after it was 
modified. These questions still re- 
main unanswered satisfactorily. 

* At the time of the contest, Baluyut 
was Secretary of Public Works and 
Communications. Maybe it was sheer 
coincidence, but Ikstre, who was ad- 
judged "winner" of the contest, was 
supervising architect in the Bureau of 
Public Works, apart from the fact that 
he was a former business partner of 
Baluyut's. Of the five members of 
the jury, two were officials of the Bu- 
reau of Public Works, while another 
whs a landscape architect of the Na- 
tional Planning Commission, all under 
the department of which Baluyut was 
secretary. On top of that, the profes- 
sional adviser of the contest was the 
consulting architect of the Bureau of

year, the collections increased to 
PSl,616-46. Last year, they fell to 
P49,780.0& Indications are that col- 
lections this year may suffer further 
decline, as the total take for the first 
six months amounts to less than F20,~ 
000. 

At the rate the campaign is going, 
the committee will take more than 50 
years to reach the goal of P3,000,000. 
Or, it may take longer. Aside from 
waiting for the so-called "voluntary" 
contributions from school children 
and government employees to come 
in, the committee chairman and cam- 
paign manager seem to be doing no- 
thing. 

Asked why he does not step up the 
drive by adopting more progressive 
methods. Campaign Manager Tan re- 
plied that he wants to make the cam- 
paign more popular by giving every* 
body a chance to contribute his bit. 
He points with pride to the fact that 
he has reduced operational expenses 
of die committee since he took over. 
But he seems to forget the fact that 
by reducing his expenses, he has also 
reduced in much greater proportion 
the collections for the fund. On the 
other hand, while the operational ex- 
penses of Chairman Zulueta and Cam- 
paign Manager Velasco in their time

and ALEGRE 



The late Senator Juan B. Alegre was 

one of Quezon's closest friends. When 
Senator Alegre met his untimely death 
in an airplane crash In 1931, his en- 
tire collection of letters, pictures, etc, 
concerning the great leader passed 
into the possession of his eldest son, 
Narciso Alegre, at present an account 
executive of the Manila Broadcasting 
Co. Mr* Narciso Alegre was able to 



preserve the collection through the 
war and it is due to his kindness that 
the accompanying pictures of great 
historical interest from that collection 
have been made available for publica- 
tion. 

The first time that Manuel Quezon 
and Juan B. Alegre met was when the 
former appointed the latter to be a 
member of the First Philippine Inde- 



pendence Mission to the United States 
{of which Quezon was the chairman), 
A close friendship developed and 
when, on December 14, 1918, the 
idyllic romance between Quezon and 
his lovely cousin, Aurora Aragon, cul- 
minated in marriage in Hong Kong, 
Alegre was one of the favored few 
who attended* 

Juan B. Alegre, after graduating in

Sargent of New York City, She fol- 
lowed her husband to the Philippines 
and made a home for him in Sorso- 
goo, his home province. The marriage 
was blessed with four children:: Nar- 
ciso, Jacinto, Jose, and Cristina. 
Against the wishes of his father, Don 
Narciso Alegre, Juan entered politics 
and was elected councilor of Gasigu- 
ran, Sorsogon. In 1921, upon the in- 
sistence of his friend, Manuel Quezon, 
he ran for senator and was elected. 
That was the beginning of his careei 
in national politics, which ran froir 
1921 to 1931, when he met his un 
fortunate accident. 

There was one time when Quezon 
and Alegre, In spite of their close and 
intimate friendship, differed sharply 
in their opinions about a certain bill 
And they clashed publicly. But Que- 
zon finally agreed with Alegre's point 
of view and sent him a peace offer- 
ing; the original rough draft of Que- 
zon's agreement speech, written in 
Spanish in his personal handwriting. 
At the end of the document, Quezon 
wrote a note, also in Spanish, which 
freely translated into English, runs as 
follows: 

"My dear friend, Don Juan: I am 
sending you the original copy of my 
speech for this afternoon. There is 
nothing in it which is not dictated 
by conviction. To a certain extent, 1 
am glad that the incident between us 
happened, as it gave me an opportun- 
ity t(i express publicly my feelings to- 
ward you. Your true friend, (Sgd.) 
Manuel L. Quezon."

rolled into a graceless, untidy bun. 
Jorge followed her into the combina-

min«3 for things to tell her, wanting 
her to laugh and smile. He touched 
her arm, but she moved on, heedless-

sewing a dress for the baby. She

"Yes?" Elen said, snapping a thread 
with her teeth, the one word muffled 
in the cloth. She fumbled among the 
strips of elodi for the pair of scissors. 
"What's his name?" 

Her query encouraged him: if he 
could only tell her the things he had 
wanted to tell Tony, if she would 
only listen and understand: the night 
at the beach, the city at two o'clock 
in the morning, the joy of youth. 
"Tony Jimenez," he said. "We used 
to call him El Abogado in class. With

reinvestigation of the charges for as- 
sault on a person in authority that had 
been filed by Fiscal Deograeias Solis 
against the governor on behalf of Ga- 
vino. This firm stand of Ga vinos pri- 
vate prosecutor indicated his desire 
u to press the assault case notwitlistand- 
ing the recent Camerino-Gavino 
"peace pact" made under President 
Q 1 1 iri no's spf n i surship. 

This development took place when 
Perrin, Camerino s counsel, asked for 
the reinvestigation of the case on the 
ground of nejvvly-discovered evidence. 
Flores scored the move as dilatory 
tactics* and inquired from the defense 
the nature of the new evidence. Per- 
rin said he needed more time to com- 
plete the new evidence, and after a 
heated argument, Fiscals Solis and 
Epitacio Panganiban granted the de- 
fense until Aug. 26 to present that evi- 
dence. Meanwhile, Gov. Camermo's 
arraignment was scheduled for yester- 
day, Friday.'
