Hon. Manuel A. Alzate 
Assemblyman 

First District, Nueva Ecija 

Manila 

My dear Assemblyman Alzate: 

Allow me to thank you for your letter 
of June 27th in which you congratulate me 
for my recent appointment as Acting Cnief 
of the newly recreated Constabulary. I 
wish to take this opportunity to thank you 
also for sponsoring the bill authorizing 
me to accept foreign decorations. These 
mean a great deal to me as they constitute 
a recognition on the part of these foreign' r 

governments for the services I have ren- 
dered . 

With my kindest regards to you and 
Mrs. Alzate, I remain 

Very sincerely yours, 


BASIL 10 J. VALDES 
(Major General)
