Quezon, Philippine President, Dies; 
Osmena Is Sworn In as Successor 

By The Associated Pre»| 

SARANAC LAKE, N.Y., Aug. 1 in the spring from Asheville 
•Manuel Qu^.nn «k flV ii^ td— • xr ^ . " :? irom Asn eville, 



—-Manuel Quezon, 65, exiled Presi 
dent of the Philippine Common- 
wealth, died today at his summer 
home here. 

Cause of death was given as ^)ul 
monarjr tuberculosis, from which 
Mr. Quezon suffered for years. At 
his bedside when death came, at 
10:05 A. M., were his widow and 
two daughters, Maria Rurora and 
Maria Zenaida, and one son, Man- 
uel Jr. Also present were members 
of his official family, all of whom 
escaped with the President and his 
family in a submarine Feb. 20, 
1942, as the Philippines fell to the 
Japanese. 

Plans for burial were not com- 
pleted tonight, but it was indi- 
cated services would be held in 
Washington. 

Mr. Quezon, who came here late 



N. C, originally was scheduled to 
step down from the Presidency last 
Nov. 15, but Congress voted to ex- 
tend his term until civil govern- 
ment is restored to tl^e islands. 

Mr. Quezon was considered al- 
most a symbol of freedom to his 
people. In several exchanges of 
notes with President Roosevelt, he 
pledged the loyalty of the Philip- 
pine people to the United States. 

Despite his illness, the fiery lit- 
tle President continued to take 
part in plans for establishment of 
an independent Philippine republiic 
and make the necessary arrange- 
ments with the United States.

Mr. Osmena was visibly moved 
as he repeated after Justice Jack- 
son the words of the oath. 

Included In the official group 
were Secretary Ickes, Joseph C. 
Grgw, former Ambassador to Ja- 
pan; Frank R. Lockhart, chief of 
the State Department's Division of 
Philippine Affairs; Maj. Gen. John 
H. Hildering, chief of the War De- 
partment's Civil Affairs Division; 
Admiral Thomas C. Hart, former 
Commander in Chief of the Asiatic 
Fleet and now on duty at the Navy 
Department as a member of the 
General Board; Francis B. Sayre, 
former Governor General of the 
Philippines, and Col. Carlos P. 
Romulo, author of "I Saw the Fall 
of the Philippines." 

Tributes to Mr. Quezon and good 
wishes to his successor were ex- 
pressed by those present, all join- 
ing in deploring with him the loss 
of his friend on the eve of the 
liberation of the Philippines, a 
sentiment shared by officials of 
all ranks in Washington. 

President Roosevelt, in a state- 
ment issued by the White House, 
said that Mr. Quezon died "in full 
confidence that the 18,000,000 Fili- 
pinos of his homeland will be freed 
of foreign domination and will be- 
come a self -governed people." 
The President's statement said: | 
"President Quezon died without I 
seeing the cause of Philippine in- 1 
dependence fully realized. Death 
came at a time when the nation 
he loved and for whose welfare he 
labored many years is in the hands 
of the Japanese invader.

The body of Manuel L. Quezon 
first President of the Philippine 
Commonwealth, was laid to rest 
in a mausoleum in Arlington Cem- 
etery yesterday to await return to 
his homeland after liberation from 
the Japanese. 

His body is in the same hillside 
crypt which holds Jan Paderewski, 
the Polish pianist;statesman who 
will be returned to Poland for 
burial when the Germans have 
been driven out. 

High-ranking / merican military 
and Government officials and 
members of the Diplomatic Corps, 
with Quezon's successor, Sergio 
Osmena, his cabinet and members 
of the late President's family at- 
tended services in St. Matthew's 
Cathedral, where the Most Rev. 
John M. McNamara, auxiliary 
bishop of Washington and Bal i- 
more, was celebrant at low mass. 
A 19-gun salute boomed across 



the cemetery in Quezon'; honor, 
after a procession from the Cathe- 
dral with Army, Navy and Marine 
escorts. 

As Quezon's body lay in state 
before the thronged congregation, 
his coffin draped with the flags of 
the United States and the Philip- 
pines, Bishop McNamara declared 
that, although he had died too soon 
to see his country freed, he had 
lived to "see the dawn of tranquil- 
lity breaking over the brink of si- 
lence." 

Participating in the church serv- 
ices and at the military rites in 
Arlington were Gen. George C. 
Marshall, representing President 
Roosevelt; Admiral Ernest J. King, 
Gen. Henry W. Arnold, USAAF, 
Lieut. Gen. Alexander A. Vande- ! 
grift, USMC, Admiral Thomas C. 
Hart, Associate Supreme Court 
Justice Frank Murphy, Secretary 
of the Interior Harold L. Ickes and 
other officials.

Philippine independence became in 
absentia the head of his 17,000,000 
countrymen held in the thralldom 
of the Japanese. 

Secretary Ickes, in congratulating 
the new Preident, told him that on 
President Roosevelt's return he 
hoped to arrange a ceremony more 
worthy of the head of the new 
nation in the East.

Drums for a President 

Manuel Quezon, 65, first President of 
the Philippine Commonwealth, lay in a 
log house at Saranac Lake, N.Y. He was 
listening: his physician was reading aloud 
from the Sermon on the Mount. Tubercu- 
losis had almost conquered his fighting- 
bantam little body. But he did not believe 
he could die when the sun was shining, 
and now it was bright morning. After a 
while he asked that the radio be turned on. 
The news: U.S. troops had landed at 
Sansapor, Dutch New Guinea. Manuel 
Quezon, who had dreamed of re-entering 
Manila with General MacArthur, ex- 
claimed: "Just 600 miles!" Then he 
coughed spasmodically. A hemorrhage 
began. When his wife came, summoned 
from Mass, he waved her away to spare 
her the sight of his suffering. He was 
unconscious in a few minutes. In a few 
more, his dragging breathing stopped. 

The Grey Bird. In Washington, Sergio 
Osmena, the shrewd, quiet, Chinese mes- 
tizo, became President of the Philippines. 
For almost a half century Osmena, like 
Quezon, had dreamed of power. But the 
impressionable Filipinos, fascinated by 
Quezon's impassioned oratory, his im- 
perious political scheming, the glitter of 
his presence, thought of Sergio Osmena 
as a grey bird flying beside a brightly 
plumaged jungle cock. Osmena accepted 
his defeats quietly, finally became Manuel 
Quezon's political friend, came with him 
to the U.S. as confidant and Vice Presi- , 
dent after the fall of the islands. 

In 1943, when Quezon's term as Presi- 
dent expired, Osmena should have suc- 
ceeded him, since a Philippine election 
was obviously impossible. Instead he agreed 
with the U.S. Administration's desire to 
leave the ailing Quezon in office as a 
symbol of freedom for his conquered 
countrymen. Now, as President, he was 
content to walk again obscured by the 
pomp of Manuel Quezon's passing. 

Quezon, who once planned to costume 
the attendants at his Philippine mansion 
like Buckingham Palace guards, went to 
his grave in somber splendor. All night, 
after its return to Washington in a dark 
baggage car, his body lay in state before 
the flower-banked altar of St. Matthew's 
Cathedral off fashionable Connecticut Ave- 
nue. White-gloved soldiers stood impas- 
sively with rifles grounded as crowds filed 
past. People of Filipino descent, great 
men of the U.S. and plain Americans 
came, paused, passed on, hour after hour. 
The next morning General Marshall, Ad- 
miral King, Interior Secretary Ickes, Sena- 
tors and Supreme Court justices were in 
the packed church as a Requiem Mass 
was said. 

Then Manuel Quezon's funeral proces- 
sion began, to the throb of muffled drums, 
the cadenced music of a military band. 
The casket was borne on a black-wheeled 
18

The last news was good news. 



artillery caisson drawn by six white horses. 
Behind it marched mourners and battalions 
from the Army, Navy and Marine Corps. . 
The procession wound its way to the 
highest hill in Arlington National Ceme- 
tery, not far from the Tomb of the Un- 
known Soldier, to a tomb beneath the 
grey steel mast of the U.S.S. Maine. There, 
to the measured boom of a 19-gun salute 
and the long, sweet notes of "Taps," 
Manuel Quezon was laid to rest.

ABOUT SIX MONTHS AFTER ENTERING THE JAPANESE PRISON CAMP IN 
MANILA SEVERAL NIPPON SECRET SERVICE MEN CAME TO THE CAMP TO ASK 
MANY OF US THIS QUESTION t T+WHAT WOULD BE THE EFFECT ON THE FILIPINO 
PEOPLE IF WE ANNOUNCED THE DEATH OF QUEZON©* MY REPLY TO THE QUEST 
TION WAS +1 DO NOT BELIEVE IT WOULD CHANGE THE VIEWPOINT. OF THE 
PEOPLE AT ALL. THEY SEEK REAL INDEPENDENCE AND I THINK ANNOUNCEMENT 
OF HIS DEATH WOULD CREATE WITHIN THEM A FIRMER DETERMINATION THAN EVER 
TO CARRY OUT HIS IDEALS FOR AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY WITHIN THE 
BROTHERHOOD OF FREE NATIONS.* 

THE JAPANESE ANNOUNCED QUEZON'S DEATH IN THEIR LOCAL PROPAGANDA 
NEWSPAPER THE NEXT DAY© STATING FALSELY THAT HE HAD DIED OF A LUNG 
HEMORRHAGE IN THE SOUTHERN ISLANDS. THE FILIPINOS DID NOT BELIEVE 
THE REPORT. THEY SAID EVEN THOUGH THE PRESIDENT SHOULD DIE THEY WOULD 
FIGHT ON FOR HIS IDEALSTTA REPUBLIC THAT COULD EXIST IN PEACE. 

THE FILIPINOS© ONLY CHRISTIAN PEOPLE OF THE ORIENT© WILL 
DEEPLY MOURN THE DEATH OF QUEZON. I^M CONFIDENT HIS PASSING WILL 
CREATE WITHIN THEM A FIRM RESOLVE TO CARRY ON HIS GREAT WORK FOR AN 
INDEPENDENCE GRANTED BY AMERICA AS OPPOSED TO THE PUPPET REPUBLIC

SENTIMENTALLY®. AND AS A TRIBUTE TO THE MEMOP.Y OF QUEZON® THE 
FILIPINOS WILL ACCEPT OSMENA IN HIS NEW ROLE. CLOSE OBSERVERS OF THE 
PHILIPPINE SITUATIONS HOWEVER© DO NOT BELIEVE OSMENA AND HIS

Quezon, The Apostle of 
Philippine Nationalism 

By Diosdado M. Yap 

Editor and Publisher, "Bataan" Magazine 



When Manuel Luis Quezon, president of the Philippine government 
in-exile, died on August i, 1944, a career ended that stretched from a 
thatched-roof hut in the remote Luzon village of Baler to the mahogany 
halls of Malacanang Palace in Manila. He died peacefully after a long 
siege of illness hardly the kind of death his adventurous life forecast. 

Few Americans who read of Quezon's death realized that one of the 
great champions of liberty, one of the few men who became a part of his 
people and his people a part of him, had passed away from the earth. 
Quezon was known in the capitals of the world, but few of the plain 
people of the earth, outside his 



native Philippines, knew of his 
colorful life or had heard of his 
dynamic speeches. Away from his 
native land, he maintained a reserve 
befitting the leader of a free people. 

Although in virtual retirement 
and half-hidden from the public 
prints by the news of the global 
war, Quezon's last days were filled 
with as many expressions burning 
with a love of liberty as were those 
he echoed through the mountains 
of the Philippine back-country 
when he fought for freedom from 
the Americans at the side of Gen- 
eral Emilio Aguinaldo, the spiritual 
heir of Dr. Jose Risal, whose writ- 
ings still inspire modern scholars. 

News of his death saddened tens 
of thousands of Filipinos in 
America, who were preparing to 
drink toasts to his health on August 
19, when he would have been 66 
years old. The Office of War In- 
formation, which had planned to 
broadcast a message from him on 
his 66th birthday to his native peo- 
ples in their own national tongue, 
Tagalog, instead sadly gave out the 
news of his death. The news 
brought sadness to the chancelleries 
of every member of the United Na- 
tions, for, while he was a stranger 
in a foreign land in his final so- 
journ in America, Manuel Luis 
Quezon was known in the far 
places of the world. 

It is likely that no man living in 
the world today has won as many 
political battles and has held a peo- 
ple so much in the hollow of his 
hand for almost 40 years as had 
the thin little man with the pain- 
wrecked face, who conquered tuber- 
culosis once but fell prey to its at- 
tacks the second time. Quezon had 
been in the seat of political power 



in the Philippines longer than the 
leader of any representative govern- 
ment on earth and he accomplished 
this remarkable record in a country 
made up of 7,091 islands, with as 
many political viewpoints, cus- 
toms, religions and folkways. To 
learn how he was able to win elec- 
tion after election, although faced 
with powerful and well-financed 
enemies, would make an interesting 
project for political scientists, and 
were any American politician to 
learn exactly how Quezon held the 
loyalty of most of the voters so 
long, it is doubtful that 10 terms 
would be too much for him to ask. 

He never lost a political battle, 
from the time he became "fiscal," a 
post corresponding to that of jus- 
tice of the peace in this country, 
until death claimed him. His poli- 
tical career was so closely inter- 
twined with the political history 
and improvements of the Philip- 
pines that a list of his "firsts" neces- 
sitates the listing of the dates of the 
beginning of every important new 
step toward freedom taken by his 
native land since the end of the 
Philippine insurrection. 

He was elected first floor leader 
of the first Filipino Assembly in 
1907. 

He was elected first President of 
the first Filipino Senate, organized 
in 1916. 

He was elected first President of 
the Commonwealth of the Philip- 
pines, November 15, 1935. 

When it was recognized in No- 
vember, 1943, that no elections 
could be held for President of the 
Philippine Commonwealth and al- 
though the Philippine Constitution 
provided that no President should 
serve more than eight years, the 




MANUEL LUIS QUEZON 

Congress of the United States, for 
the first time in its history, voted 
to set aside a written constitution 
and to continue Quezon as Presi- 
dent of the Philippines until such 
time as elections could be held in 
the islands. Sergio Osmena, vice 
president of the government-in- 
exile, who acceded to the presidency 
on the death of Quezon, acquiesced 
in this proposal. 

So far as is known, the first two 
Americans ever to see Quezon and 
to give him more than passing no- 
tice were two soldiers of the Ameri- 
can Expeditionary Force in the 
Philippines who captured him on 
a hot day in August in the little 
mountain town of Mariveles. A 
short, sply, handsome little man, 
he was dressed in a rather nonde- 
script uniform when he was cap- 
tured by Lieutenant Lawrence S. 
Miller and Private Roy Squires, 
who immediately gave him his free- 
dom under the general amnesty 
then being offered all insurrection- 
ists who would surrender peace- 
fully and take an oath of allegiance 
to the American flag. 

In his later life, Quezon was to 
become known as something of a 
dandy in political circles the world 
over, but there was little to indicate 
his future sartorial perfection the 
day he became an American subject. 

Quezon had given up for a pur- 
pose. He immediately went to 
Manila to verify whether or not 
General Aquinaldo really had been 
captured, as had been rumored. 
When he learned that this was true 



Philippine Policy 



\ Freedom Approaches For Islands 



THE MAGNIFICENT SUC- 
CESS of the landing upon Leyte 
and the spectacular triumph of 
the United States Navy in its 
long-awaited contest with the 
Japanese fleets, marks a definite 
turn in the tide of the war of the 
Pacific. But these achievements 
also mark the rapid approach of 
the day when the Philippine na- 
tion will finally achieve its sov- 
ereign freedom. 

Few commitments made by 
their Government in their name 
-nave given the people of the 
United States more genuine sat- 
isfaction than the promise made 
to the Philippine government in 
exile, and through it to the Fili- 
pinos themselves, that as soon as 
the efforts of the two joint forces 
had liberated the Philippine Is- 
! lands from the Japanese invad- 
; ers the people of the Philippines 
\ would obtain their complete in- 
dependence. 

The record of the United 
States in its relatively brief ex- 
perience as a colonial adminis- 
trator contains much of which 
iwe can as a Nation be justly 
proud. The initial errors in 
policy and the excesses of the 
earliest days are outweighed in 
the balance by far-reaching 
physical, cultural and economic 
benefits which the Filipinos have 
obtained as a result of their as- 
sociation with the United States. 
What American science and skill 
have accomplished in sanitation 
and medicine and in the creation 
of means of communication and 
of new sources of production has 
indeed been notable. Not only 
have devastating diseases been 
eliminated, but the whole stand- 
ard of living of the people has 
been greatly raised, to their last- 
ing advantage. Education has 
been uppermost in the adminis- 
trative program, and education 
of the most practical character, 
with especial emphasis on agri- 
cultural and industrial training. 
And during the last 12 years 

every opportunity has been af- 
mb**w#£&2r ■ 



TO THOSE who knew and ad- 
mired Manuel Quezon it is doub- 
ly tragic that he could not have 
lived to see the day of liberation, 
The government-in-exile con- 
tains men of recognized devo- 
tion, patriotism and ability, whose 
services will be dedicated to then 
fellow countrymen when the dif- 
ficult times of reconstruction 
have to be faced and when the 
first stage of independence, with 
its inevitable complexities, is at 
hand. But Quezon was in many 
ways a unique as well as an in- 
spiring figure. 

. He may have made his mis- 
takes. What statesman does not? 
Yet he possessed a flaming faith 
in the ultimate triumph of the 
cause of Philippine national 
freedom and a passionate love 
for his native land beside which 
any errors of judgment pale into 
insignificance. 

President Quezon was first and 
foremost a Filipino patriot. He 
looked to the future, after the 
present war is won, from the 
standpoint of securing the adop- 
tion of those international meas- 
ures and policies which in his 
belief would most surely re- 
dound to the advantage of the 
Philippine nation and most 
readily guarantee the safety and 
prosperity of his own people. 

He was insistent, however, that 
In that future era of independ- 
ence, toward hastening which' all 
of his efforts were devoted in 
these last years and to which he 
unsparingly sacrificed his frail 
physical resources, a close friend- 
ly partnership with the United 
States would be more than ever 
necessary if the Philippine peo- 
ple were to obtain security after 
the earlier ties had been severed. ' 

MORE THAN THAT he be- 
lieved that with the support of 
the United States the independ- 
ent Philippine nation might be- 
come one of the foundation

It is with a heavy heart that we learn about the death M 
Manuel L. Quezon in a sanatorium in New York. Whatever be 
his sins and mistakes in the past, we cannot but depiore 
death, especially knowing that he died in virtual exile, far from 
the country and people for whom he had labored for well-nigh 
half a century. We condole with all those who share in the grief 
over his unfortunate demise. 

No matter what our political leanings and loyalties in the 
past, we cannot but admit the role played by Mr. Quezon in fight- 
ing for Filipino autonomy. As resident commissioner at Wash- 
ington, he secured the passage of the first Philippine autonomy 
act. the Jones Law, in 1916. His is the now classic line, "Better 
a government run like hell by Filipinos than one run like heaven 
by Americans". Had he his way, the Philippines would probably 
have been spared most of the horrors of this .war of kha»*s*4* 
But he was thwarted in his efforts, and was always conceded only 
halt- way successes in his bargaining with the American congress 
and president. Wall Street hod Philippine economy in its vise- — 
like grip and Quezon had to submit to many humiliating compro- 
mises, most disgraceful of which was the recent independence act , 
with its onerous military and naval reservations clauses, a Machia- 
velian political gesture forced upon a dying man's unresisting ■ 
will by an unfeeling American president. Knowing how loudly 
Quezon protested against those clauses in the Hare-Hawes-Cutting 
Act, we can only surmise how its imposition hastened his death. 

But death has something final about it. Death has put finis 
to his career. As far as we of the Philippines are concerned, 
while we respect his memory, we accept the unalterable fact that 
his death also put an end to the agreements and compromises 
he had willy-nilly entered into with the American government, in 
the lattcr's efforts to keep a hold on Filipino sympathy in this 
war. The curtain falls completely on the Commonwealth Gov- 
ernment in captivity, and the lights of the stage are turned off . 
on the disgraceful independence measure forced by the U. S. Con- 
gress upon a dying man. 

And now, we turn our realistic eye on the contemporary scene 
at home. Since Quezon's forcible departure from the Philippines, 
things have happened so fast and so decisively that they stand 
out in clear contrast to the many half-way accomplishments allow- 1 
ed by the past regime. In less than two years of Military Ad- 
ministration, the Philippines was proclaimed an independent Re- , 
public with a Constitution framed and approved by the best Fili- 
pino minds, a law-making body composed of elective Filipinos, and < 
a President who is presently devoting all his efforts to reconstruct . 
the country and help the nation rise over the ruins of war. 

Under the unilateral Pact of Alliance entered into with Japan, j 
the Independent Philippine Republic enjoys the help and protec- 
tion of Nippon's fighting forces in these trying times oj^ actual 
warfare. How different from the onerous and humiliating condi- • 
tions imposed by America! For while the Pact of Alliance with 
Japan gives actual protection to our freedom, the military and 
naval reservations proposed by America, as the price of a dubious 
independence to be granted us if and when America shall have 
violated our peace once more and reconquered our free country, 
will stand as an affront to our national sovereignty and as a 
provocation to our neighbors, thus, to inspire ill-will if not actual 
war. Such an arrangement offered by America would never leave 
us peaceful and secure. 

Fortunately, America does not run the whole show while Jap- 
an's gallant forces stand on guard by our side in this mighty for- f 
tress of defense, ready to defend our liberty. It is incumbent 
upon all Filipinos to protect and still perfect this freedom which 
has become ours. And now that the man who accepted America's 
offer is dead, let that offer be interred, too, and forgotten. 

May Manuel L. Quezon's soul rest in eternal peace! 



Quezon Laid to Rest 
In Arlington Crypt 
Until End of War 

Manuel Quezon, first President of 
the Philippines, who died Tuesday 
at Saranac Lake, N. Y., was laid to 
rest today in Arlington National 
Cemetery after services at St. Mat- 
thew's Cathedral which were at- 
tended by high-ranking Govern- 
ment, Army and Navy officials. 

The Most Rev. John M. McNa- 
mara, Auxiliary Bishop of the Arch- 
diocese of Baltimore and Washing- 
ton, was the celebrant of the re- 
quiem mass at the church. He later 
officiated at the final service at the 
cemetery, where the body was placed 
in a mausoleum to lie until it can 
be returned to the Philippines. 

Bishop McNamara likened Presi- 
dent Quezon to a pilgrim, rather 
than the chief executive of a na- 
tion.^ "A pilgrim who has reached 
the end of the journey of life." 

"It is a hoiy and wholesome 
thought to pray for the dead," he 



draped casket for a last look at the i 
body before taking a seat in her pew ; 
for the mass. Leaving, she paused J 
to kiss the rings of both Bishop Mc- j 
Namara and Bishop Paul Yu Pin of' 
Chungking, temporarily domiciled in, 
Chevy Chase, who was in the! 
sanctuary during the mass. 

Bishop McNamara took her by the 
hand and spoke quietly to her, then 
she knelt before the two bishops for 
their blessing. 

More than a score of clergymen,!, 
representing the various orders of | 
the Catholic Church, were in the 
flower-banked sanctuary during the I 
mass, including Msgr. Cornelius P.] 
Brennan of Philadelphia, who for-! 
merly was stationed in the Philip-! 
pines, and Mgs. Bernard McKenna. 
also of Philadelphia and an ac-j 
quaintance of President Quezon.; 
Also present was the Very Rev. 
William A. Fletcher of the Mary- 
knoll Mission, who served as liaison 
between the most Rev. Michael J. 
O'Dougherty, Bishop of Manila, and 
President Quezon several years ago.

regretted that the President did not 
live "to see the end of the long, dark 
night of silence." 

But it was a consoling thought, he 
continued, that President Quezon 
had lived "to see the dawn of tran- 
quility" breaking over the brink of 
darkness. 

Bishop McNamara. paraphrased 
Cardinal Newman in his closing re 
mark: , , . 

"Now that the busy world is 
hushed and the fever of life is over, 
and his work is done, may God in 
His mercy grant him a safe lodging, 
a quiet rest and peace at the last."

Archbishop of New York, was 
celebrant at a Pontifical Mass 
of Requiem Saturday (Aug. 5)

(Continued from Page One) 
S.J., who preached the sermon 
said: "It was a worthy cause 
for which Manuel Quezon con 
secrated and exhausted his 
powers. He was a very young 
man when, with enthusiasm 
youth and zealous patriotism, he 
espoused that sacred cause as his 
life work; the cause which was 
the independence of his 14,000 
000 people, who constitute by far 
the oldest and largest Catholic 
group of the Orient, having a 
centuries-old civilization. 

"The Philippine Islands are 
rich in gifts of nature but richer 
still with the beauty of God's 
creation, so that they have with 
every reason been called the 
'Pearl of the Orient/ Why should 
these people not possess also the 
gift of freedom? This was the 
thought of Manuel Quezon 
through the passing years. His 
youthful enthusiasm, keen com- 
prehension and calm judgment as 
a statesman won him the confi- 
dence of his generous - hearted 
fellow citizens. Thus equipped, 
despite his weak physical consti- 



tution, he continued over forty 
years with untiring labor to ad- 
vance the cause of his people and 
to bring it to the very threshold 
of success. 

"God called him at a moment 
when the cause he loved and 
worked for must have been weigh- 
ing heavily upon his sensitive 
soul. His sacrifice, we may as- 
sume, was a final contribution to 
God, asked from him for the 
cause he had espoused forty years 
earlier, and from his people, who 
are soon to enjoy the liberty he 
had been preparing for them and 
who will ever hold his name in 
benediction. 

"The tribute of a grateful 
people will be solace to the gentle 
lady whom President Quezon has 
left to mourn his soul. Valiant, 
yet gentle, Mrs. Quezon is known 
to be a veritable angel of peace, 
administering always to the needs 
of the poor and destitute; always 
ready to support and encourage 
every movement for material and 
spiritual improvement in the 
Philippines. To her across the 
sea we send our heartfelt sym- 
pathy,"

A Tribute to the Late President Quezon 



REMARKS 

OF 

HON. HAROLD C. HAGEN 

OF MINNESOTA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, April 17, 1945 

Mr. HAGEN. Mr. Speaker, we have 
had the extreme opportunity of listening 
to the Honorable Carlos P. Romulo, Res- 
ident Commissioner of the Philippines, 
who has told us today of the ravages 
that have been visited upon the Philip- 
pine people during the occupation by the 
Japanese, and of the terrible destruction 
that has been wrought by the cornered 
barbaric Jap fanatics. 

We are most grateful for this authen- 
tic first-hand report. Judging from the 
hearty reception General Romulo has re- 
ceived here today, there is no doubt in 
my mind that the sympathies, best 
wishes, and support of this House are 
with his valiant people. 

Just yesterday I had an opportunity 
to read a letter which was addressed to 
General Romulo by P. W. Reeves, a con- 
gressional secretary, who has spent con- 
siderable time in the Philippines. I am 
a member of the House Committee on 
the Territories, and am interested in both 
Territorial and insular possessions. It 
has been suggested that I insert Mr. 
Reeves' fine tribute to Manuel Quezon, 
the late President of the Philippines, in 
the Congressional Record. I am very 
glad to do so.

It is as follows: 

Washington, D. 0., April 9, 1945. 
Hon. Carlos P. Romulo, 

Resident Commissioner, 

Commonwealth of the Philippines, 
Neiu House Office Building, 
Washington, D. C. 
Dear General Romulo: It was my rare 
privilege to meet the late Manuel Quezon 
in 1935. I talked with him again on one of 
his trips to Washington in 1937, when he 
was the guest of honor at a luncheon given 
in the National Press Club. I saw him sev- 
eral times at his office in Manila in 1937. I 
corresponded with him after I left Manila. 
I saw him for the last time about 1 year be- 
fore he was taken from us. 

When I learned the shocking news of the 
passing of this great man, I wrote to Mr. Gil 
Montilla, Judge Sabino Padilla, Mr. Raf. 
Alunan, Mr. Vicente Carmona, Hon. Jose 
Yulo, and others. I told them how I had 
been saddened by the death of this man 
among men. I also wrote to General Mac- 
Arthur because he knew how greatly I ad- 
mired his departed friend. I wanted you, as 
Resident Commissioner, to know that those 
of us who knew President Quezon mourn his 
passing. 

Because of his fine friendship, I shall never 
forget him. Because of what he did for his 
country and his people, the world will never 
f orget him. His passing is a loss to the world 
because he was a statesman of the highest 
ty pe. He was, indeed, one of the most re- 
markable men I have ever known or read 
about Whether one knew Manuel Quezon 
nt—y or merely watched his a^es 
, s an onlooker, all admired him. So many 
fi ne hings can be said about him that it is 
^emely difficult for one to choose any 
particular quality upon which to dwell. 



President Quezon was endowed with that 
extraordinary clarity of vision, that vivid 
imagination, which is the mark of the truly 
great man. He had that boundless energy 
which brought into execution dreams which 
he had dreamt. He could see what others 
could not see. He could see further than 
others could see. And he could see before 
others saw. 

There was not a coarse fiber in the make- 
up of this great leader. His love and devo- 
tion for his people was beyond compare. 
He gave his life to the cause of his people. 
The full extent of his sacrifice Will never be 
known. He was modest beyond description. 
He was a man of great learning and hign 
ideals. He had a warm heart and a sympa- 
thetic personality. With his wonderful 
qualities and his vast experience, he devoted 
himself unsparingly for the benefit of his 
people. He was a slave to his honest con- 
victions, and he could not be swerved from 
them. He feared no man or combination oi 
men. Political expediency never entered 
into his calculations or decisions. His bit- 
terest enemies never challenged his honesty 
of purpose. The impelling force which 
guided this man throughout his eventful 
life was his desire to help the Common- 
wealth of the Philippines. He never shirked 
a duty. He never wearied in his efforts. He 
never hoisted the white flag of defeat. He 
spent himself utterly. He had no thought 
of his own comfort or his own welfare. He 
was at all times completely at the service 
of his Commonwealth. He died as he lived, 
fighting for the welfare of humanity. 

The example set by your former President 
will forever stand out as a beacon light, 
typifying the quality and character that go 
to make up a great man in all senses of the 
WO rd He used his great talents to advance

FORMER PRESIDENT, REV. ARTHUR O'LEARY, S.J., MAKES 
LATE PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES, MANUEL QUEZON, A

MANUEL QUEZON, PHILIPPINES PRESIDENT 
LOSES BATTLE AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS 



Received Honorary LL.D. from Georgetown Law School 
1937; Son a Graduate of Georgetown Prep, Preparing 
for Studies for Priesthood 



A few days ago the news of the death of Manuel Luis Quezon, 
President of the Philippine Islands, was reverently spread^across 
the face of a mourning earth. At the age of 65, the exiled head 
of the Philippine government passed on at Saranac Lake, N. Y. 
Tuberculosis, which had afflicted him for many years, at last con- 
quered his body and claimed the life of this courageous, proud 
and kindly statesman and scholar. Just before he expired, how- 
ever, President Quezon heard with supreme joy that American 
soldiers had effected a landing at Sansapor, Dutch New Guinea, 
just 600 miles from his native country.

PRESIDENT QUEZON 

(Continued from page 1) 

Interviewed by Hoya 
hen intervie wed on the day he wa 



presented with his degree from George- 
i.n town, President Quezon was inter- 
viewed by a Hoya correspondent. Dur- 
ing the course of that friendly, informal 
chat the diplomat told the reporter that 
Japan had absolutely no intentions of 
trying to seize the Philippine Islands, 
once fhey had obtained their complete 
independence from the United States. 

Quezon was correct for the Japanese 
did not wish to wait until then before 
administering their brutally crushing 
blows upon his peaceful homeland. 

Later in the interview the President 
exclaimed, in no uncertain terms, "The 
Filipino people believe in peace and will 



Although it was his ultimate desire 
to return to Manila in triumph with 
General Douglas MacArthur, he never- 
theless died happy in the thought that 
at least part of that dream was even- 
tually materializing. 

The body was sent by rail from Lake 
Saranac to Washington, and laid in 
state in St. Matthew's Cathedral, 
where it was humbly received b y | 
throngs of people, both great and ob- iod odiio[is
