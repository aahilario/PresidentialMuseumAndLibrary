INTRODUCTION 



In light of the upcoming national and local elections, the Presidential 
Communications Development and Strategic Planning Office (PCDSPO) pays 
tribute to this national exercise in democracy by tracing the electoral history of the 
Philippine Presidency, from the first time the Filipino people elected an undisputed 
leader in 1935 and onward. 

The Philippine Electoral Almanac also features the legislative elections held 
thereafter and explores the intricacies of the relationship between Congress — 
the elected representatives of the people, who are bestowed legislative power — 
and the President — the elected head of state and of government, who is granted 
executive power. It likewise delves into the history of coalitions, the partnerships 
established between political parties or personalities for myriad purposes, as well 
as the national referendums that have allowed the people to express their stand on 
fundamental political issues. 

Despite the ubiquity of elections — with the frenzy of the campaign and the 
anticipation for the last ballot cast — there has been a regrettable dearth of accessible 
and easily understandable comprehensive information on the history of Philippine 
elections. This project aims to respond to this lack, while fulfilling the mandate of 
the PCDSPO as custodian of institutional memory of the Office of the President. 
The creation of the almanac entailed research, study, and analysis of authoritative 
documents from various government and private organizations. The information 
is presented as infographics to be readily understood by a new generation. 

This online initiative serves as a study of Philippine democracy at work. The 
history of elections, which is an exercise of our collective sovereign will as a people, 
provides a context with which to understand the young, flourishing Filipino nation. 
For despite war and dictatorship, the Philippines has always managed to find its 
way back to the principle of democratic government: one person, one vote, and the 
right to freely make a choice. 

The polls are at the heart of our political culture; it is a signal for change and an 
emblem of our collective decisions — and of who we are as one people and of what 
we value.

THE PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESPERSON 




On the online initiatives of the PCDSPO for the 2013 national and local polls 



To mark the official campaign period for the 2013 national and local elections, 
the Presidential Communications Development and Strategic Planning Office 
(PCDSPO) is publishing a series of materials online showcasing the rich heritage of 
the Philippine electoral process. Today, PCDSPO has prepared a historical briefer 
on Plaza Miranda, the country's foremost public square of the Republic. 

As custodian of the institutional memory of the Philippine Presidency, PCDSPO will 
be featuring infographics and briefers detailing the political relationship between 
Congress and the Presidency as well as the importance of midterm elections for 
every administration. These will be published in the coming weeks on the PCDSPO 
website (www.pcdspo.gov.ph). 

We hope that this online initiative to present the forthcoming electoral exercise in 
the context of previous polls will be helpful to our partners in media, the academe, 
and the Filipino public as a whole. In its entirety, PCDSPO presents the study of 
Philippine democracy at work, through its ultimate manifestation — the ballot.

ELECTIONS OF 



1 






By virtue of the 
Tydings-McDuffie 
or Philippine 
Independence Act of 1934, 
the Commonwealth of the 
Philippines was established, 
creating with it the position 
of president and vice 
president and a unicameral 
legislature called the 
National Assembly. It also 
mandated the Philippine 
Legislature to call for an 
election of delegates to a 
Constitutional Convention 
to draft a constitution 
for the Philippines. The 
document produced was 
submitted to the President 
of the United States for 
certification on March 25, 
1935, and was ratified by 
the Filipino people through 
a national plebiscite on May 
14, 1935. 

On September 16, 1935, 
the first national elections 
in the Philippines were held. 
The two leading Nationalist 
politicians — outgoing 
Senate President Manuel L. 
Quezon and former Senate 
president pro-tempore 



Sergio Osmena — joined 
forces to form a powerhouse 
coalition ticket. They faced 
former President Emilio 
Aguinaldo and Raymundo 
Melliza, who ran under 
the National Socialist 
Party, and Bishop Gregorio 
Aglipay of the Philippine 
Independent Church who, 
with Norberto Nabong, 
reestablished the Republican 
Party. 

The coalition ticket won by 
a landslide, with Quezon 
winning in all provinces 
except the Aguinaldo and 
Aglipay bailiwicks of 
Cavite and Ilocos Norte, 
respectively. Osmena, on 
the other hand, demolished 
his opponents and lost only 
in the province of Cavite, a 
feat unsurpassed to this day. 

While united for the 
country's top two 
positions, Quezon's Partido 
Nacionalista Democrata 
(Antis) and Osmena's 
Partido Pro-Independencia 
Democrata (Pros) slugged 
it out for seats in the 



National Assembly. This 
unicameral legislature had 
98 elected members, of 
which 87 were from existing 
representative districts, 
eight from existing special 
provinces, and three from 
the Mountain Province. 
A significant majority of 
elected assemblymen were 
Antis (72%), while 21% 
were Pros; the rest belonged 
to opposition groups. 

The 1935 Constitution 
came into full force and 
effect on November 15, 
1935, with the inauguration 
of the Commonwealth. 
Among its provisions 
was that it would remain 
the constitution of the 
Republic of the Philippines 
once independence was 
recognized on July 4, 1946.

LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS OF 




Ahead of the first midterm polls in 
the country, the two factions of the 
Partido Nacionalista had already 
reunited. The party went into the 1938 
Elections with the confidence of having 
practically every branch of government 
under the control of its stalwarts. This 
reconsolidation of political forces left 
the opposition in tatters, with the Allied 
Minorities, a loose caucus of opposition 



parties, failing to stop the Nacionalista bid. 
The elections of 1938 proved to be historic 
in two ways: It was the first and last time 
that a single party would secure 100 
percent of the seats in the legislature, with 
the Nacionalistas winning all 98 seats; and 
it ushered in the years of one-party rule in 
the country.

ELECTIONS OF 

1941 



Up for re-election in 1940, the 
Nacionalista Party leaders seemed 
unbeatable at the polls. Meanwhile, 
the opposition was in disarray. Having been 
soundly defeated in legislative elections three 
years prior, some of the most prominent 
oppositionist leaders like Pedro Abad 
Santos and Manuel de la Fuente of the 
Partido Nacional Democrata endorsed both 
Quezon and Osmena. The remaining anti- 
Nacionalista forces, unable to unite the 
minority forces, revived the Popular Front 
and fielded Juan Sumulong and Dr. Emilio 
Javier. Hilario Moncado of the Partido 
Modernista also ran for president. 




changed the terms of president and vice 
president from six years without re-election, 
to four years with the possibility of re- 
election — a total of eight consecutive years. 



A constitutional amendment passed in 
1940 established a bicameral legislature 
composed of the House of Representatives 
and the Senate. In another historic electoral 
triumph, the voters swept into office an all- 
Nacionalista Senate, the first and last time 
that all 24 seats were won by a single party. 
This was largely due to the introduction of 
"block voting," which allowed voters to 
write the party name on the ballot instead of 
naming the chosen candidates individually. 
In the House, 95 out of 98 representatives 
elected were Nacionalistas. 



Quezon and Osmena were both re-elected; 
however, due to constitutional limitations, 
Quezon could not serve the full four years, 
as his term started on November 15, 1935, 
and thus would end on November 15, 1943 

Due to the outbreak of war, the terms of 
Quezon and Osmena as president and 
vice president, respectively, were officially 
extended starting November 15, 1943, 
following the passage five days earlier of a 
U.S. Joint Resolution known as U.S. Public 
Law 186. 



For the first time, a national electoral 
authority, the Commission on Elections, was 
established by a constitutional amendment. 
Another constitutional amendment also 



War and the occupation by the Japanese 
Imperial Forces would lead to an interregnum 
of five years before liberation brought back 
democracy to the country.

ELECTIONS OF 

1946 



In 1944, Sergio Osmena 
returned to the 
Philippines, president 
of a country devastated 
by war and on the verge 
of independence. He had 
assumed the office upon the 
death of Quezon on August 
1, 1944, and in 1946 decided 
to run for the presidency. 
Osmena was unperturbed 
by the challenge posed by 
erstwhile protege Senate 
President Manuel Roxas, 
who had broken away from 
the monolithic Nacionalista 
Party (NP) and founded 
its Liberal Wing, later the 
Liberal Party (LP). 

The Cebuano politician 
subscribed to the traditional 
outlook of his generation, 
who found it distasteful to 
solicit the people for votes. 
Roxas, on the other hand, 
launched what would be 
remembered as the first 
"modern" campaign, 
with him going house to 
house. Hilario Moncado 
of the Partido Modernista 
also joined the fray, but 
fared poorly. In the end,

Roxas, the youngest of the

prevailed over Osmena 
by almost 200,000 votes. 
Osmena graciously accepted 
defeat and was the only 
outgoing president to attend 
his successor's inauguration 



until the fifth Republic. 
The Senate was equally 
divided, with both the NP 
and the NP (Liberal Wing) 
winning eight seats each.

LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS OF 

1947 



Held a year and a half following the 
proclamation of Roxas as president 
of a newly independent and self- 
governing Republic of the Philippines, the 
election of 1947 saw the same matchup 
as the year prior: between the NP (Liberal 
Wing) — now officially the Liberal Party 
(LP) — and NP. Both parties, ideologically 
divided over the parity issue that granted 
equal access to natural resources for 
both Filipinos and foreigners, seriously 
sought out to build alliances for the much- 
anticipated Senate polls. With eight seats 
being contested, the Senate majority would 
be determined by this crucial election given 
both LP and NP each won eight seats in 
the 1946 polls. LP joined forces with 
the Popular Front, Laborite Party, Young 
Philippines, and the old Partido Democrata, 



while NP coalesced with the Democrata 
Alliance, Philippine Youth Party, and a 
faction of the Popular Front. 

Senate President Jose Avelino, LP President, 
scored the opposition and said, "the 
Nacionalista Party of today is not the 
party of Quezon and Osmena ... (it is) the 
party of Hukbalahaps and other dissident 
elements." In response, NP President Eulogio 
Rodriguez appealed for the voters to give the 
opposition a stronger mandate to fiscalize 
the administration, which they accused of 
being corrupt and incompetent. 

The first midterm polls in the Third Republic 
resulted in a victory for the administration, 
with the LP winning seven out of eight seats 
in the Senate.

1947 PLEBISCITE 




Upon the death of President Roxas in 
1948, Vice President Elpidio Quirino 
assumed the presidency. Prior to his 
sudden demise, Roxas had been reported 
to favor another stalwart from northern 
Luzon, Senator Quintin Paredes, to be his 
running mate in 1949. Quirino's place as 
standard-bearer of the LP did not sit well 
with a wing of the party led by the powerful 
Senate President Jose Avelino, which resulted 
in an intraparty split into "Quirinistas" 
and "Avelinistas." Quirino picked Senator 
Fernando Lopez to be his running mate, 



while Avelino chose Vicente J. Francisco. As 
the Liberals fought among themselves, the 
Nacionalistas were equally in a quandary 
with their nominee former President Jose P. 
Laurel, whose controversial stint as President 
of the Japanese-sponsored Second Republic 
led many to brand him a collaborator. 

In the end, the elections resulted in a victory 
for the Quirinistas, capturing Malacanang, 
all eight seats in the Senate (the second such 
administration sweep of the Senate), and a 
majority in the House.

LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS OF 

1951 



As the Hukbalahap insurgency 
raged in Central Luzon, Filipinos 
trooped to the polling booths for 
the 1951 midterm elections — a referendum 
on President Quirino, who had won the 
presidency in his own right two years 
prior. Despite the political remarriage of 
the two factions of the Liberal Party, the 
Quirinistas and Avelinistas, the Quirino 
administration was still far from popular and 
had gained notoriety for its inability to rein 
in corruption and its ineffectual attempts to 
police lawlessness in the countryside. The 
Nacionalistas took advantage of the situation 
and mounted an active campaign to wrest 
back the Senate from the LP. Led by former 
President Jose P. Laurel, Quirino's chief 
adversary in the 1949 presidential polls, the 
NP swept all eight Senate seats in contention, 



the first total victory of the opposition in the 
Senate. So strong was the rejection of the 
Quirino administration in 1951 that even LP 
top honcho, Senate President Mariano Jesus 
Cuenco, lost his seat. Laurel received the 
highest number of votes, which was seen as 
his political rehabilitation and which made 
him the first and only president, thus far, to 
have served in the Senate after his presidency. 

Felisberto Verano, also a Nacionalista, won 
the special elections held on the same day to 
fill the Senate seat vacated by Vice President 
Fernando Lopez. 

Block voting, established in 1941, was 
abolished in 1951 with Republic Act No. 599. 
This would later lead to more fragmented 
results in most national elections.

After seven years of LP rule, the 
Nacionalistas were raring to 
return to power but were without 
a viable presidential candidate. The most 
obvious choice, former President and now 
Senator Jose P. Laurel, had announced 
he was "spiritually tired" and would not 
seek the presidency. Laurel's proposal was 
the adoption of Defense Secretary Ramon 
Magsaysay, whose successful anti-insurgency 



and anti-communist initiatives had strained 
his relations with the President and the LP. 
Despite initial protests from some quarters 
in the NP, Laurel's unequivocal support for 
"the man who will fulfill the need of the 
hour" — to battle communism — resulted 
in Magsaysay's nomination as standard- 
bearer of the opposition Nacionalistas, with 
Senator Carlos P. Garcia from Bohol as his 
running mate. 



1953 ELECTIONS 



The Liberals, too, were squabbling over who 
would go up against the popular Magsaysay. 
An ailing President Quirino then proclaimed, 
"I am going to run for re-election, even 
if I have to die in the attempt." The LP 
nominated LP President, former Speaker, and 
Senator Jose Yulo as his running mate. 

Following the nomination, Philippine 
Ambassador to Washington Carlos P. Romulo 
and his men walked out of the LP convention 
and formed the Democratic Party (DP). 
The DP then nominated Romulo for the 
presidency and supported the re-election of 
Vice President Fernando Lopez. 




What was supposed to be a three-way race 
was reduced to a battle between the ruling 
Liberals against the Nacionalistas after the 
DP withdrew in support of Magsaysay, 
resulting in the Nacionalista-Democrata- 
Nationalist Citizens' Party (NCP) coalition. 

The elections proved to be a resounding 
victory for the popular Magsaysay and 
Garcia. It was the biggest first-term landslide 
win in Philippine Presidential electoral 
history — a feat that remains unsurpassed to 
this day.

LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS OF 




President Ramon Magsaysay, elected by 
landslide in 1953, was an unstoppable 
political force in his midterm election 
of 1955. His adoptive Nacionalista Party 
continued to grow in strength with the 
absorption of their erstwhile coalition partner, 
the Democratic Party; but a pillar of the NP 
could not hide his opposition to the president. 
Senator Claro M. Recto, one of those who 
actively sought the adoption of the former 
Defense Secretary into the NP fold in 1953, 
had grown critical of Magsaysay, calling him 
a "banana dictator" and "American puppet," 
among other unflattering names. In retaliation, 
Magsaysay refused the inclusion of Recto 
into the NP Senate slate of 1955, prompting 
the Batangueno leader to seek support for his 
candidacy with the Liberals. 

Though Lorenzo Tanada of the NCP had 
cooperated with the NP in 1953, Recto 
became the first "guest candidate" in Philippine 



electoral history, when he was included in 
the Liberal Party lineup but did not resign his 
membership as a Nacionalista. Political scientist 
Dapen Liang called this a "novel creation ... 
as a solution to a certain peculiar problem or 
problems in practical politics." 

Despite Magsaysay's popularity, the Liberals 
did not just give up the Senate. They set up 
a formidable slate of incumbent and former 
senators, as well as rising stars in the LP 
congressional delegation, including Pampanga 
Representative Diosdado Macapagal. Despite 
this, the Nacionalistas swept the Senate. Recto, 
still a Nacionalista, was the only winner from 
the LP slate. Macapagal, a neophyte on the 
national stage, finished a respectable ninth 
place, the highest ranked Liberal senate bet in 
the 1955 election. Roseller Lim, a Nacionalista, 
won in a special election to fill the Senate seat 
vacated by Carlos P. Garcia, who had been 
elected vice president in 1953.

ELECTIONS OF 



1957 



Carlos P. Garcia 
succeeded to 
the presidency 
on March 18, 
1957, following the 
untimely death of 
President Magsaysay 
in a plane crash. 
Only a few months 
before Magsaysay's 
expected re-election, 
Garcia had secured 
the NP's nomination 
for the presidency 
with Speaker Jose 
B. Laurel Jr, as 

his running mate — but not everyone was 
convinced the career politician from Bohol 
was the right man for the job. Thus, two other 
factions emerged from the NP. Senator Claro 
M. Recto bolted the NP to run for president 
under the Nationalist Citizens' Party and 
picked Lorenzo Tanada as his running mate. 
Meanwhile, other Magsaysay supporters 
established the Progressive Party of the 
Philippines and endorsed Manuel Manahan 
for the presidency, in tandem with Vicente 
Araneta. The Liberal Party, for its part, fielded 
former Speaker Jose Yulo for president and 
Rep. Diosdado Macapagal for vice president. 

This would be the second time Garcia and 
Yulo would face each other in an electoral 
contest. In a repeat of their 1953 encounter, 




Garcia trounced his main opponent Yulo, 
bested Recto and Manahan, and won the 
presidency in his own right. Laurel, however, 
was defeated by Macapagal. The Senate and 
the House remained solidly Nacionalista. 
This also marked the first national victory of 
a "showbiz candidate," with the election of 
matinee idol Rogelio de la Rosa. 

The 1957 elections were unprecedented in 
three ways: it was the first time that there were 
four serious contenders for the presidency; the 
first time that the elected president and vice 
president did not come from the same political 
party; and the first time the president was 
elected by a plurality instead of a majority of 
votes.

1959 LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS 




While all seemed 
rosy for the ruling 
Nacionalistas 
following the 1959 midterm 
polls, the run-up to the 
general election of 1961 
was fractious for the party. 
Infighting and loyalty checks 
resulted in the expulsion of 
several high-profile members 
including Emmanuel Pelaez 
and Sergio "Serging" 
Osmena Jr. for being critical 
of the administration. The 
intraparty conflict came to 
a head when the NP chief 
Senate President Eulogio 
"Amang" Rodriguez and 
President Garcia had a 
very public falling out, 
prompting former President 
Sergio Osmena to call for 
party unity ahead of the 
presidential polls. In a 
convention that did not 
include Rodriguez, the 
Nacionalistas nominated 
Garcia to be their standard- 
bearer, with Senator Gil 
Puyat as his running mate. 

On the other side of the 
political divide, the Liberal 
Party had coalesced with 




ELECTIONS OF 

1961 



the Grand Alliance and 
styled themselves the United 
Opposition, fielding Vice 
President Macapagal and 
former Senator Pelaez. 

Rogelio de la Rosa, a 
matinee idol, also sought 
the presidency while 
Serging Osmena ran for 
vice president, both as 
independent candidates. 
De la Rosa would later 
withdraw to run for a Senate 
seat instead. 

After 12 years in opposition, 
the Liberals finally won, with 



both Macapagal and Pelaez 
scoring major victories 
against their opponents and 
winning a majority of Senate 
seats. Osmena Jr., despite 
running as an independent, 
received more votes than 
Puyat, catapulting him into 
the national spotlight. 

The 1961 elections was the 
first time the Iglesia ni Cristo 
endorsed a set of candidates, 
supporting a Garcia-Osmena 
tandem. This provoked a 
reaction from the Catholics 
and contributed to the 
Liberal victory.

By mid-1963, the LP had become the 
dominant party in both chambers 
of Congress. The House was won 
as early as June 1962 when a handful of 
Nacionalistas crossed the aisle and installed 
Cornelio Villareal as Speaker. Later on, in 
April 1963, Marcos had overthrown the 
formidable Amang Rodriguez as Senate 
President. The midterm elections to be held 
in November that year would be a crucial 
test for the Macapagal administration. 

However, just like the previous Liberal 
administration, this one could not capitalize 
on its status as ruling party to sweep 
the Senate. Only four of Macapagal's 
Senate bets won, leaving four other seats 
to Nacionalistas. Though considered a 
numerical draw and a marked improvement 
compared to the wholesale LP defeat in

1951 and 1953, the four Senate seats won 
under Macapagal was still considered an 
indictment of his leadership. The Senate 
draw, however, was a boon to Senate 
President Marcos, who remained safe in his 
position as number 3 with his bipartisan 
majority.

had bolted the LP to join 
the NP. Vice President 
Pelaez, despite having 
been earlier booted out of 



the NP, had also quit the 
ruling LP and returned to 
the NP. Both Marcos and 
Pelaez subsequently put 
their names on the ballot 
for NP standard-bearer 
in 1965. Interestingly, the 
two new recruits were the 
frontrunners in the NP 
convention, with Marcos 
winning the nomination, 



while Pelaez decided to run 
for his old Congressional 
seat in Misamis Oriental. 
Senator and former Vice 
President Fernando Lopez, 
another former Liberal, 
was chosen to be Marcos' 
running mate. 

After the Nacionalistas, 
it was the LP's turn to 



1965 ELECTIONS 



nominate their bets for 1965. President 
Macapagal was nominated for re-election 
and he chose Senator Gerardo Roxas, 
topnotcher in the 1963 Senate polls and son 
of the late President Manuel Roxas, to be his 
vice president. 

A third party emerged called the Partido 
Pilipino, later known as the Party for 
Philippine Progress (PPP), with Senators 
Raul Manglapus and Manuel Manahan as 
its standard-bearers. 

The three-way fight resulted in the victory 
of the Nacionalista ticket, with Marcos 
leading Macapagal by more than half a 
million votes. Lopez, however, won the vice 
presidency by a margin of 0.4% of the vote 
(or less than 27,000 votes) — the slimmest 
margin of victory ever recorded for a 
national post in Philippine electoral history. 

The campaign was also noteworthy 
for having been a battle of campaign 
biographies and films. The Marcos camp 
published For Every Tear a Victory: 
The Story of Ferdinand £. Marcos, and 
produced Iginuhit ng Tadhana (Destined), 
while Macapagal countered with the 
release of Macapagal the Incorruptible 
and Daigdig ng Mga Api (World of the 
Oppressed). 

In the Senate, the NP continued to 
dominate, with five of its bets winning 
against only two Liberals. One seat was 
won by Senator Lorenzo Tanada of NCP, 
then allied with the LP.

LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS OF 

1967 



With the Nacionalistas firmly in 
control and President Marcos's 
popularity on the rise, the 
Nacionalista Senate slate powered through 
the midterm polls of 1967. Only one 
Liberal won — Senator Benigno S. Aquino 
Jr., already one of President Marcos's 
staunchest critics. The strong showing 
of the NP in 1967 provided a sturdy 
foundation from which Marcos would 
launch his re-election bid two years later. 
A plebiscite on proposed amendments to 
the Constitution was held simultaneously 
with the legislative elections.

1967 PLEBISCITE 




Riding high on the 
success of his first 
term as president, 
Ferdinand E. Marcos was 
chosen to be the standard- 
bearer of the Nacionalista 
Party. Vice President 
Fernando Lopez also clinched 
the administration party's 
nomination. The Marcos- 
Lopez powerhouse ticket 
would face the Liberal 
Party's Senators Sergio 
Osmena Jr. and Genaro 
Magsaysay. Osmena, the 
son and namesake of the 
late president, had served as 
governor of Cebu, almost 
won the vice presidency in 
1961 as an independent, and 
was elected to the Senate 
four years later. Magsaysay, 
brother of the late president, 
had been a se nator since 
1959, and though originally 
a Nacionalista, had accepted 
the nomination of Osmena 
and the Liberals. 

The party decision of 
importing Magsaysay did 
not sit well with Liberals, 
including former House 
Speaker Cornelio Villareal 




ELECTIONS OF 

1969 



and Senator Ambrosio 
Padilla, who both led a mass 
defection from the LP to 
the Marcos-Lopez camp. 
Villareal, a Liberal since 
the party was founded, had 
earlier announced he would 
seek the LP's nomination 
for the presidency but 
was rebuffed by the party 
leadership. 

Wracked by internal conflicts 
and party intramurals, 
Osmena lost to Marcos by 
almost two million votes 
while Lopez won over 
Magsaysay by an even larger 



margin. Marcos would be 
only the second President to 
win re-election, and the only 
one in the Third Republic. 
The election practically 
crippled the Liberal Party. 
Even the bailiwicks of the two 
Liberal standard-bearers — 
Cebu and Zambales — voted 
for Marcos; only LP Senator 
Gerardo Roxas survived the 
NP shutout in the Senate (the 
other LP senator, Ambrosio 
Padilla, was known as a 
"Marcos Liberal"); and 
the short-lived LP House 
Majority in 1965 was 
reversed.

1969 ELECTIONS 




LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS OF 

1971 




Opposition to the Marcos administration 
had grown significantly since his re-election 
just two years prior. Student demonstrations, 
labor strife, and unrest in the countryside 
were prime contributors to the widespread 
discontent with government. Facing his 
second and final midterm, President Marcos 
faced an opposition thirsting for a senate 
win. The Liberals, who were almost wiped 
out in the 1967 and 1969 elections, seized 



the moment and charged the Marcos 
administration for its inability to address the 
key issues of lawlessness, unemployment, 
and high prices. The president insisted 
fighting communism remained the most vital 
problem of the country. True to form, the 
president blamed the Communists for the 
vicious bomb attack on the Liberal Party's 
miting de avance held in Plaza Miranda. As 
a result, the LP swept the polls for the first 



1971 LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS 



time in a decade, capturing six seats against 
only two for the Nacionalistas, setting the 
stage for what would have been an exciting 
1973 general election. 

However, under the guise of a period of civil 
unrest, marked by bombings around Metro 
Manila and the ambush of Defense Secretary 
Juan Ponce Enrile, President Marcos placed 
the country in a state of Martial Law 
on September 23, 1972. The issuance of 
Proclamation No. 1081, s. 1972, coincided 
with the closing of the sessions of both 
chambers of Congress. President Marcos 
also issued Presidential Decree No. 86 on 
December 31, 1972, which created Citizens 
Assemblies in each barrio or district, to be 
composed of all residents 15 years old and 
above. 

Just days before Congress was scheduled to 
resume session in 1973, Citizens Assemblies 
voted to ratify the proposed Constitution 
which had been submitted by the 1971 
Constitutional Convention. The Convention 
gave President Marcos powers to assure a 



smooth transition from a presidential system 
to a parliamentary form of government, 
which the Committee had approved 158- 
120. The new Constitution included a 
provision for the creation of the Interim 
National Assembly, to be composed of all 
the members of the Convention who had 
voted for the said Constitution and previous 
congressmen who were willing to support 
the ideals of the New Society. It also made 
voting compulsory and lowered the voting 
age from 21 to 18. 

Votes in the January 1973 plebiscite were 
cast by means of a show of hands, in place 
of secret ballot. 

The Constitution was declared in force two 
days later on January 17, 1973 by President 
Marcos, who had assumed both executive 
and legislative powers for himself. He 
then ordered the padlocking of Congress, 
preventing the opening of the Second 
Regular Session of the 7th Congress. Thus, 
the Third Republic gave way to the New 
Society.

LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS OF 




Ninoy's Appeal to the Teachers (and the Filipino people) 

'Our democracy struggling to be reborn is in your hands... ' 



TEACHERS OF THE REPUBLIC: 

Exactly seven days from today, on April 7, 1978, you will discharge the most awesome responsibility in 
our Republic. On your integrity and dedication - in the exorcise of this duty - will rest the survival or death 
of our democracy struggling to be reborn . 

Philippine democracy is anchored on the bedrock of free and honest elections. Corrupt the ballot, mani- 
pulate the electoral process, and you stifle the people's wilt and smother this democracy in its resurrection. 

I do not ask you to be partisan for us, the LAKAS NG BAYAN. But I ask you to be partisan for your- 
selves, our people, the Republic, our posterity. 

It can be the beginning of a new dawn In our lives as a people. The whole thing will turn in what you do. 

The challenge of destiny is before you. In your hands is what we, the Filipinos, will be. I beg you: 
Bear true witness to our people's will! 

From the dawn of our political consciousness, the Filipino people have opted unequivocally, as may be 
gleaned from all our Constitutions, for a democratic form of government - one where the political decisions 
are taken by representatives duly and freely elected by the people, where the representatives are fully 
accountable and responsible to the people. 

But the people's representatives, through whom the governmental powers are exercised, must be DULY 
AND FREELY chosen. Only thus can the minority be compelled to accept and follow the rule of the majority. 

Without a free vote, MIGHT BECOMES RIGHT and power emanates from the end of the barrel of a 
gun. When this happens, when legal reforms become impossible, as the tragic lessons of so many places tell us, 
revolution becomes inevitable. It is to avert this that I write you. 

TEACHERS OF THE REPUBLIC: You are now the shock troops in the frontline* of our democracy. 
Stand your guard and our democracy triumphs. Allow yourselves to be bought or cowed, and our democracy 
dies in your hands. 

It isa mighty task, I realize. It demands, as duly, response in the heroic mold. 

We, in Lakas ng Bayan, will be the first to recognize this, just as we fully recognize now what you have 
been in the scheme of government up to the present — the least paid, but the most worked, the least tended, 
but the most abused, among the public servants. 

And we pledge to you: If we are elected to the Interim Bausaruj Pambansa, the first Item on our agenda 
will be to give you the nation's gratitude and to redress the wrongs done you - the sins of com mi sston and 
omission perpetuated on you — through the years. 

Before I end this appeal, allow me to capsulize {he aims, the beliefs, the ideology of the Lakas ng Bayan. 

Our aim is to put economic power in the hands of the people as a whole and create a community In 
which free men work together as equals. 

Sigaw ng Bayan: LABAN! • Sa Halalan, I boto: Straight LABAN 



We believe in a mixed economy. While we advocate national economic planning to maximize the use of 
our meager resources, we do not adopt as a rigid rule the comprehensive stale ownership of all means of 
production. We believe in giving the idea of a competitive free market as much leeway as possible. In brief, we 
stand for "as much competition as possible, as much planning as necessary." 

Our ideology insists on a pluralistic society in which no party seeks to impose its particular philosophy 
on society as a whole. 

OUR BATTLE CRY IS: EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND FREEDOM! Cqualily is meaningless without 
freedom and freedom Is a mockery without equal opportunity. 

What we ask is an alternative to be desired wishfully against what there is, the Marcos martial rule! - a 
Good Society, not just a New Society that, in fact, is as old as the first tyranny; a government of, for and 
by the people, not a one-man rule! 

We agree there must be peace and order, for without either we can only decay as a people and break 
as a nation — but peace with freedom, not the peace of the silenced, and order with justice, not the order of 
the dragooned! 

We stand for equal rights for all, special privileges for none - the social and economic justice due every 
Filipino by birthright, which has been deprived them by the system of spoils enjoyed by the New Society's 
first 25 families. 

Guarantee us - the Lakas ng Bayan - a free and honest election on April 7 and you shall witness the 
blossoming of an unprecedented national unity. But allow us to be cheated in the coming polls and you shall 
have only yourselves to blame if this Republic we all love is torn asunder by sttife. 

Give us an honest count and you give the Filipino people a stability that shall propel our nation to 
prosperity. Frustrate the people's true will by manipulating the results and you plant the seeds of a long dark 
night of fratricidal conflict. 

Should you allow yourselves to be bought or intimidated, should you shir* from your sacred duty and 
compromise your integrity, should you allow us, the handful men and women who dared challenge the 
martial rule to be deprived of the fruits of our hard-earned victory, then the blood ol our countrymen who 
shall surety die defending our freedoms will be in your conscience. 

I pray this appeal, made from a lonely cell inside Fort Bonifacio, will find a sympathetic response in the 
core of your being. 

In the name of God and the Filipino people, TEACHERS OF THE REPUBLIC, please do your job and

Manifesto of Benigno S. Aquino Jr. regarding the upcoming elections. (Photo from Ninoy: The Witting Martyr by Alfonso P. 
Policarpio Jr.) 



The election of 1978 
was the first election 
held in seven years 
and the first one operating 
under the amended 1973 
Constitution, which 
prescribed the election of a 
unicameral legislature, to be 
known as the Interim Batasan 
Pambansa. Members of this 
chamber, called assemblymen, 
would be elected through 
block voting (previously 
abolished in 1951) and at- 
large on a regional basis. 

Having consolidated power 
over the past six years, 



President Marcos had 
effectively neutralized the 
opposition. A national 
referendum held in 1977, 
pursuant to Presidential 
Decree No. 1229, served 
to legitimize his rule, 
with voters approving 
the continuation of his 
term and exercise of 
power. He established the 
Kilusang Bagong Lipunan 
(KBL), composed of 
various politicians from 
the Nacionalista and 
Liberal Parties as well as 
independents, to be the 
administration vehicle for 



the elections. With the 
electoral setup and odds 
stacked against them, the 
mainstream opposition, 
made up mostly of LP 
stalwarts, largely boycotted 
the polls, resulting in a 
complete sweep of the 
KBL nationwide. Two 
holdouts remained — fiercely 
oppositionist Cebu, where 
regional party Pusyon Bisaya 
had won; and Region X, 
where opposition stalwart 
Cagayan de Oro Mayor 
Reuben Canoy also won. 
The opposition managed to 
win a total of 16 seats.

ELECTIONS OF 

1981 



Six months prior to the elections, Marcos 
had officially lifted Martial Law, but since 
all decrees issued during that time were 
still in force, it served only a symbolic purpose. 
Amendments to the Constitution approved 
through a national referendum in April 1981 
allowed for a president to be elected at-large, 
with a six-year term and possibility of re- 
election. It also granted him additional powers 
to create laws through presidential decrees 
and to dissolve the Batasang Pambansa, and 
created the Executive Committee and the 
Office of the Prime Minister. 

Marcos was anointed by the KBL as its 
standard-bearer, with his main opponent 
being NP's Alejo Santos, former Defense 
Secretary and World War II guerilla leader 
who had served as governor of Bulacan. A 
third candidate, former Bohol Congressman 
Bartolome Cabangbang, was fielded by the 
Federal Party. 

Mainstream electoral groups including 
LABAN, the LP, and other oppositionist 
personalities boycotted the polls, labeling it a 
sham after Marcos refused the conditions they 
had previously proposed, such as a minimum 
campaign period, a purging of the voters' lists, 
equal time and space for the opposition, and a 
reorganization of the COMELEC. 

As expected, Marcos won with more than 18 
million votes, compared to Santos' 1.7 million 



and Cabangbang's 700,000. The president 
carried every province — even Bulacan and 
Bohol — by large margins. So wholesale was 
the president's victory that his opponents 
did not get a single vote in four areas: the 
provinces of Ilocos Norte and Tawi-Tawi and 
the cities of La Carlota (Negros Occidental) 
and Trece Martires (Cavite). Thus, the third 
presidential contest of Ferdinand Marcos, 
organized to legitimize his 15-year rule 
and usher in his New Republic, resulted in 
the most lopsided victory in the history of 
presidential elections in the Philippines.

Pambansa. (Photo from Assembly of the Nation by Manuel L. Quezon III.) 



On January 27, 1984, a national 
referendum pursuant to Batas 
Pambansa Big. 643 approved the 
reestablishment of the vice presidency and 
allowed for the elections of members of the 
Regular Batasan Pambansa, who, after serving 
an initial six-year term under the Interim 
Batasan Pambansa, were to be elected at-large 
per province. The same referendum designated 
the speaker of the Batasang Pambansa as 
acting president should the presidency be 
vacated before the 1987 presidential elections. 

Opposition to the Marcos regime had 
heightened due to the faltering economy and 
the assassination of former Senator Benigno 



"Ninoy" Aquino Jr. a year prior. Participation 
in the elections was a contentious issue among 
the opposition, with prominent political 
personalities such as former Senators Lorenzo 
Tanada, Jose W. Diokno, Jovito Salonga, and 
Agapito "Butz" Aquino, brother of the late 
Senator Ninoy Aquino, opting to boycott the 
polls. 

Marcos and his KBL allies still dominated 
the elections, but the opposition United 
Democratic Organization (UNIDO) led by 
former Senator Salvador "Doy" H. Laurel won 
almost a third of the seats in the Batasan — 61, 
a marked improvement from the 16 in the 
outgoing Assembly.

Bucking to international 
pressure to legitimize 
his decades-long rule, 
a visibly ailing President 
Marcos called for a snap 
Presidential election in 
February 1986, ahead of its 
original schedule in 1987. 
President Marcos mobilized 
the KBL, with its diminished 
majority in the Batasan, and 
picked former Senator and 
now Assemblyman for Metro 
Manila Arturo Tolentino to 
be his running mate. The 
position of vice president had 
been officially reestablished, 
more than a decade after 
it had been abolished 
following the declaration of 
Martial Law, pursuant to a 
Constitutional amendment 
approved in a national 
referendum held two years 
prior (see Elections of 1984). 

Meanwhile, the opposition 
had two frontrunners for the 
presidency: former Senator 
Doy Laurel and Corazon 
C. Aquino, widow of the 
martyred former Senator 
Ninoy Aquino. Though 
initially reluctant, Laurel was 




eventually convinced that 
their tandem was the only 
way the opposition forces 
stood a chance against the 
overwhelming power of 
Marcos and the KBL, and 
decided to run as Aquino's 
vice president. Both ran 
together under his UNIDO. 

Massive poll fraud and 
rampant cheating marred 
the vote, with the Batasang 
Pambansa proclaiming 
Marcos the winner. Electoral 
watchdog NAMFREL 
(National Movement for 
Free Elections), however, 
showed Aquino in the lead 
with almost 70% of the votes 
canvassed. The opposition 
held an indignation rally in 
Luneta where the Aquino- 



Laurel ticket proclaimed 
victory. In the coming days, 
hundreds of thousands 
massed in EDSA, Metro 
Manila's main thoroughfare, 
calling for the peaceful ouster 
of the dictator. Aquino and 
Laurel took their oaths in 
Club Filipino, a country club 
in the nearby suburb of San 
Juan. Rocked by key military 
and political defections, 
Marcos was inaugurated 
in the Ceremonial Hall 
of Malacanan Palace and 
delivered his inaugural 
address in Maharlika Hall 
(now Kalayaan Hall) before 
departing for exile in Hawaii. 
The two-decade rule of 
Marcos came to an end.

LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS OF 




F 



ollowing the 
restoration 
of democracy 



in 1986, President 
Corazon C. Aquino 
issued Proclamation 
No. 3, which 
suspended certain 
provisions of the 
1973 Constitution 
and promulgated in 
its stead a transitory 
constitution. A 
Constitutional 
Commission, tasked 
with drafting a 
new charter, was 
created by virtue of 
Proclamation No. 
9, s. 1986, issued on 
April 23, 1986. The new 
Constitution they produced 
was ratified through a 
national plebiscite on 
February 2, 1987. 

In the first elections 
held under the 1987 
Constitution, pro-Aquino 
had parties formed the 
"LABAN" or Lakas ng 
Bayan coalition and faced 
off against the opposition 
coalition Grand Alliance 




for Democracy (GAD). 
President Aquino's fledgling 
government faced a crucial 
test of legitimacy. While her 
rule was largely ratified by 
the overwhelming support 
of the 1987 Constitution, 
the Senate remained the 
battleground to thwart the 
opposition's attempt to 
discredit her presidency. The 
result was a 22-2 LABAN 
sweep of the Senate, with 
only two GAD bets, former 
Defense Minister Juan 



Ponce Enrile and San Juan 
del Monte Mayor Joseph 
Ejercito Estrada, making it 
to the cut. The 1987 Senate 
elections would go down 
as one of the most lopsided 
upper house victories in 
Philippine electoral history.

1987 PLEBISCITE 





For the first time, the Philippines 
had a presidential election under 
the multiparty system, as opposed 
to the two-party system which had been 
in place since 1935. Seven candidates 
contested the first presidential election 
following the restoration of democracy in 
1986. President Corazon C. Aquino had 
chosen Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos 
of the newly minted Lakas ng Tao party 
as her successor. Challenging Ramos were 
Senate President Jovito Salonga of the 
Liberal Party, House Speaker Ramon Mitra 
of LABAN ng Demokratikong Pilipino 



(LDP), Agrarian Reform Secretary Miriam 
Defensor-Santiago of the People's Reform 
Party (PRP), Vice President Salvador H. 
Laurel of the Nacionalista Party (NP), 
former Ambassador Eduardo "Danding" 
Cojuangco Jr. of the Nationalist People's 
Coalition (NPC), and former First Lady 
Imelda Marcos of her husband's Kilusang 
Bagong Lipunan (KBL). 

Traditional geopolitical considerations 
resurfaced, with the presidential and 
vice presidential candidates hailing from 
different regions of the country. Ramos

headed PDP-LABAN; 
Marcos, who grew up 
in Leyte, ran in tandem 
with Zambales Governor 
Vicente "Vic" Magsaysay. 



Two candidates took exception. Laurel 
picked former Senator Eva Estrada-Kalaw, 
his erstwhile foe in the vice presidential 
race of 1986, to form a solid Batangueno 
ticket. It is widely known, however, that the 
vice president had originally intended to 
run with former Senator Rodolfo Ganzon 
of Iloilo. For his part, Cojuangco partnered 
with then Senator Joseph Ejercito Estrada, 
a former matinee idol with nationwide 
appeal, the eventual winner by a landslide. 

Ramos won the election with the smallest 
plurality in Philippine electoral history 
with only 23% of the vote, followed by 
Defensor-Santiago with 19%, Cojuangco 
18%, and Mitra 14%. Candidates of the 
three older parties — KBL, LP, and NP — 



finished last with Marcos and Salonga 
each getting a little over 10% and Laurel a 
distant 3.4% 

In the Senate, LDP dominated, with 16 of 
its bets making it to the 24 vacant seats. 
The rest of the slots were won by NPC (5), 
Lakas (2), and LP-PDP-LABAN (1). 

The 12 senators with the highest number 
of votes would serve a full six-year term 
until 1998, while the remaining 12 senators 
would serve only until 1995. Thereafter, 
senators would be elected on a staggered 
basis of 12 every three years.

The first midterm poll in the post- 
EDSA era, the 1995 election was a 
test for the Ramos administration, 
which had come into power with a 
minority vote and only a few allies in 
the legislature. Ramos's Lakas-NUCD 
had coalesced with LDP, led by his 1992 
foe, former House Speaker Ramon Mitra 
Jr., to form the Lakas-Laban coalition. 
The opposition was composed of the 



NPC of Danding Cojuangco, PRP of 
Miriam Defensor-Santiago, and the KBL, 
represented by the son of the strongman 
himself, Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. 
After a hard-fought campaign, Ramos and 
the Lakas-Laban coalition won 9 out of the 
12 Senate seats in contention, leaving the 
opposition with three.

Attempts of President Ramos to 
amend the Constitution and establish 
a unicameral, parliamentary 
system of government was met with stiff, 
multisectoral opposition. His charter change 
initiatives appeared to heavily favor his 
chosen successor — Speaker Jose de Venecia 
Jr., an expert coalition-builder in the House 
of Representatives. Failing to amend the 
charter, the second presidential elections 
under the 1987 Constitution pushed through 
with even more candidates compared to 
1992. Eleven hopefuls slugged it out for the 
presidency: Vice President Joseph Ejercito 
Estrada (LAMMP), House Speaker Jose de 
Venecia (Lakas-NUCD-UMDP), Senators 
Raul Roco (Aksyon Demokratiko), Miriam 
Defensor-Santiago (PRP), and Juan Ponce 
Enrile (Independent), Manila Mayor Alfredo 
Lim (LP), Defense Secretary Renato de Villa 
(Reporma-LM), former Cebu Governor 
Emilio Osmena (PROMDI), Philippine 
Charity Sweepstakes Chairman Manuel 
Morato, and Santiago Dumlao. 

With the rising influence of mass media, 
traditional geopolitical considerations no 
longer held sway. Of the major tandems, 
there were three all-Luzon partnerships: 
Estrada of San Juan with Senator Edgardo 
Angara of Aurora; de Venecia of Pangasinan 
with Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo of 
Pampanga; and de Villa of Batangas with 
Governor Oscar Orbos of Pangasinan. 



Three followed the traditional North-South 
dynamic: Roco of Bicol with former Davao 
City Vice Mayor Inday Santiago; Lim of 
Manila with Senator Sergio Osmena III of 
Cebu; and Santiago of Iloilo with Senator 
Francisco Tatad of Catanduanes. Notably, 
the tandem of PROMDI (Probinsya Muna 
Development Initiatives) was from Visayas 
and Mindanao, the first in mainstream 
Philippine electoral politics, with Osmena 
of Cebu with former OIC Governor of 
Cotabato Ismael Sueno. 

Estrada led opinion poll surveys from 
the beginning, with de Venecia and Roco 
making little headway toward the tailend 
of the campaign. Civil society leaders and 
others in the broad political spectrum made 
much ado about his incompetence to lead 
the country but did little to unite anti- 
Estrada forces. In the end, Vice President 
Joseph Ejercito Estrada and Senator Gloria 
Macapagal-Arroyo won the presidency and 
vice presidency, respectively, by a landslide. 
Both garnered twice the number of votes of 
their nearest rivals. 

In the Senate, five seats were won by the 
outgoing administration party Lakas, and 
seven seats were won by Estrada's LAMMP 
allies (four by LDP, one by PMP, one by 
NPC, and one by PDP-LABAN).

001 



Elected by a landslide barely two 
years prior, President Joseph Ejercito 
Estrada had been impeached by the 
House of Representatives and was being 
tried in the Senate for a host of offenses, 
including graft and corruption and plunder. 
In January 2001, a vote was held in the 
Senate over the opening of an envelope that 
purportedly contained evidence against the 
President. Estrada allies in the Senate voted 
against its opening, which prompted a series 
of mass protests and defections, culminating 
in EDSA Dos and the ascension of Vice 
President Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo to the 
presidency. 

In the run-up to the May 2001 polls, anti- 
Estrada forces, badly divided in 1998, 
coalesced as the People Power Coalition 



(PPC) and campaigned for a 13-0 sweep 
in the Senate. PPC, composed of Lakas- 
NUCD-UMDP, the Liberal Party, Aksyon 
Demokratiko, PROMDI, Reporma-LM, and 
other smaller parties, presented a formidable 
lineup of incumbent and former Senators, 
civil society leaders, and key personalities in 
the Estrada impeachment trial. Meanwhile, 
Estrada and his allies organized the Pwersa 
ng Masa (PnM) made up of remnants of his 
erstwhile LAMMP coalition. 

What would have been Estrada's midterm 
would turn out to be the first test of popular 
support for the newly installed Macapagal- 
Arroyo administration. The result was a 
clear victory for the PPC, winning eight seats 
against PnM's five.

Facing recurrent challenges to 
her legitimacy as President, the 
elections of 2004 was the chance 
Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo had to win the 
presidency in her own right. Despite a 
public statement that she would not seek 
re-election, she assembled a formidable 
coalition — K-4 — led by her adoptive party 
Lakas-CMD and parties that were in 
opposition to the Estrada regime in support 
of her bid. Arroyo picked 2001 Senate 
topnotcher and former broadcaster Manuel 
"Noli" de Castro Jr. to be her running mate. 

The People Power Coalition that had helped 
her administration win an outright Senate 
majority three years earlier, however, had 
disbanded; three smaller parties of the 
coalition, namely Aksyon Demokratiko, 
Reporma-LM, and PROMDI, threw their 
support behind former Senator and Education 
Secretary Raul Roco, who formed the 
Alyansa ng Pag-asa. Roco had chosen former 
Tarlac Rep. Herminio Aquino to be his vice 
president and ran as an alternative to Arroyo, 
distinct from the mainstream opposition 
which was dominated by sympathizers of 
former President Estrada.

composed of the LABAN ng Demokratikong 
Pilipino (LDP), Estrada's Partido ng Masang 
Pilipino, and other minority parties. The 
once-formidable LDP, however, had split 
into the Angara wing that supported Poe 
and the Aquino wing, led by former Senator 
and Makati Representative Butz Aquino, 
who supported partymate Senator Panfilo 
Lacson for the presidency. Another contender, 
televangelist Eduardo "Eddie" Villanueva, 
also threw his hat into the race. 



Meanwhile, the opposition fielded matinee 
idol Fernando Poe Jr. and Senator Loren 
Legarda, a recent recruit from the ruling 
party. Their political union was backed by the 
Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino (KNP), 



The result was victory for President Arroyo 
and de Castro amid allegations of vote- 
rigging and electoral fraud. K-4 scored a 
majority in the Senate with seven of its bets 
winning against five from the KNP.

2004 ELECTIONS 



LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS OF 




President Arroyo's first official midterm 
election took place amidst serious 
allegations of poll fraud and a series of 
mass demonstrations against her regime. 
Anti- Arroyo forces, now more consolidated 
against the juggernaut Lakas-CMD, had 
formed the Genuine Opposition (GO) 
and adopted a compelling messaging line: 
hang boto lang po LABAN sa nakaupo 
(a vote against the incumbent). Seemingly 
unperturbed, Arroyo and her loyalists 
mainly from Lakas-CMD, KAMPI, and 
PDSP formed Team Unity (TU) and 
boasted that party machinery coupled 
with command votes would trump the 
opposition's overwhelming popularity. But 
even the much-vaunted administration 



advantage showed vulnerability early on 
with KAMPI, Arroyo's original party, raiding 
the ranks of the Lakas-CMD for members. 
In some areas, only Lakas and KAMPI 
candidates were in contention. The inability 
of TU to come up with a strong slate was 
made even more obvious with its admission 
of two opposition stalwarts who were 
excluded from the GO lineup. 

The sweeping victory of the opposition 
was a repudiation of President Arroyo's 
administration. GO won ten seats while 
only two administration bets made it — 
re-electionist Senators Joker Arroyo and 
Edgardo Angara, known more as political 
mavericks instead of Arroyo loyalists.

ELECTIONS OF 




010 



Coalitions among the major parties did 
not materialize in the election of 2010, 
the first time since the restoration of 
democracy in 1986. Nine candidates contested 
the presidency: Defense Secretary Gilbert 
Teodoro (Lakas-KAMPI-CMD), Senators 
Benigno S. Aquino III (LP), Manuel Villar 
(NP), Richard Gordon (Bagumbayan), Ma. 
Consuelo "J am t>y" Madrigal (Independent), 
former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada 
(PMP), Councilor John Carlos de los Reyes 
(Ang Kapatiran), and environmentalist 
Nicanor Perlas (Independent). 

Their choice of running mates showed a 
further waning of traditional geopolitical 
bases in favor of nationwide appeal. It was 
also the first time there were guest candidates 
for vice president. Teodoro, a former Tarlac 
Representative, picked television host Edu 
Manzano while Villar, a former Senate 
President from Las Pinas, picked Senator and 
former broadcaster Loren Legarda (NPC); 
Estrada joined forces with Makati Mayor 
Jejomar C. Binay (PDP-LABAN) for an all- 
Metro Manila ticket; and Gordon, a former 
Olongapo City mayor, ran with Bayani 
Fernando, Metro Manila Development 
Authority Chairman and himself a former 
mayor of Marikina City. Only the LP ticket 
featured a Luzon- Visayas tandem with 
Aquino running with Senator Manuel Mar 
Roxas, a former Capiz representative and son 
of the late Senator Gerardo Roxas.

The main election issue was the corruption 
allegations hounding the outgoing Arroyo 
administration. The Aquino-Roxas tandem 
ran on an anti-corruption platform that was 
first heavily favored in opinion polls; but 
while Aquino stayed in the lead, the polls 
indicated Binay was catching up with Roxas. 
On election day, Aquino was elected by a 
landslide, but his running mate Roxas lost to 
Binay by a mere 800,000 votes or a little over 
2% of the vote. 

In the Senate, the Liberals captured four 
seats (including independent guest candidate, 
former Senator Sergio Osmena III); NP, 
Lakas-KAMPI-CMD, and PMP got two each; 
while NPC and PRP got one apiece.

CONGRESS AND THE 
PRESIDENCY 




Since the first State of the 
Nation Address (SONA) 
was delivered by President 
Manuel L. Quezon in 1935, 
the opening of the regular 
session of the legislative 
branch of government has 
been marked by a message 
from the President of the 
Philippines on the state 
of the nation. This is a 
function of two additional 
roles of the chief executive 
and the legislature: For 
the chief executive, it is 
a constitutional duty in 
keeping with established 
traditions worldwide, 
where the head of state 
opens parliament; for 
the legislature, it is an 
acknowledgment that aside 
from legislation, Congress is 
oversight: and the SONA is 
in essence an annual report to 
both houses of the legislature. 

With few exceptions (World 
War II, Martial Law, and 
1986 EDSA Revolution), this 
tradition has been honored 
throughout the history of the 
Philippines, and it continues 
to this day: On July 23, 2012, 
President Benigno S. Aquino 



III delivered his third SONA 
during a joint session to 
mark the opening of the third 
regular session of the 15th 
Congress of the Philippines. 

Of the 15 men and women 
who have served as President 
of the Philippines, 12 have 
previously served in the 



legislature. The exceptions 
are Presidents Emilio 
Aguinaldo and Fidel V. 
Ramos, who served in 
the military, and Corazon 
C. Aquino, who became 
president through a popular 
revolt. Even among this 
minority, however, links to 
the legislature are evident:

CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENCY 



The fathers of both Ramos and Aquino 
served as representatives in the Lower 
House. 

Since its foundation in 1916, the Senate 
has been considered as a training ground 
for the presidency, particularly since 
1941, because of its at-large, nationwide 
constituency and tradition of erudite debate 
As such, all presidents with the exception 
of five (Aguinaldo, Magsaysay, Macapagal, 
Corazon C. Aquino, and Ramos) had

unsuccessful.

experience in the Senate. In fact, Quezon, 
Roxas, and Marcos were also Senate 
presidents, whereas Osmena and Quirino 
were Senate presidents pro-tempore. 

Topping the senatorial elections has been 
proven to be durable political basis on 
which to launch a bid for higher office. In 
recent history, all senators who had strong 
showings in the elections either sought or 
were groomed to seek higher office.

There have also been senators who, after failing to win higher office, were eventually elected 
Senate president.

Thus far, the only president to have served 
as senator after his term was Jose P. Laurel, 
who considered his election to the Senate in 
1951 a political rehabilitation from charges 
of wartime collaboration. 

Two presidents, Osmena and Roxas, served 
as speakers of the House. Six presidents 
did not have experience in the House of 
Representatives prior to serving as president: 
Aguinaldo, Laurel, Corazon Aquino, Ramos, 
Estrada, and Arroyo. 

Ramon Magsaysay, then a representative 
from Zambales and Chairman of the House 
Committee on Defense, was chosen by 
President Elpidio Quirino to be his Secretary 
of National Defense. Magsaysay, who is 
credited for neutralizing the HUKBALAHAP 



threat, was eventually recruited by the 
opposition and successfully challenged 
Quirino's re-election bid. 

The untimely death of President Magsaysay 
resulted in the ascension of Carlos P. 
Garcia to the presidency. Seeking his own 
election to the presidency in 1957, Garcia 
recruited House Speaker Jose B. Laurel 
Jr. for vice president to go up against the 
tandem of former House Speaker Jose Yulo 
and Pampanga Representative Diosdado 
Macapagal. For the first time, the election 
resulted to the president and vice president 
coming from separate parties: Garcia, a 
Nacionalista, and Macapagal, a Liberal. 
Four years later, Macapagal would defeat 
Garcia for the presidency. 



107 CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENCY 



Philippine electoral history shows that the House speakership is a weak springboard for 
higher national office. All speakers of the House who have sought either the presidency or 
the vice presidency were unsuccessful.

Two speakers became president: 
Osmena and Roxas, but both also served in 
the Senate. Some former House speakers 
had moderate success in pursuing higher 
office, though only Manuel Roxas, who 
was Speaker from 1922 to 1933 and 
subsequently Senate President from 1945 
to 1946, has been elected President. Before 
him, Sergio Osmena, who had served the 
longest as Speaker from 1907 to 1922, was 
elected senator and vice president, then 
later ascended to the presidency following 
the death of President Manuel L. Quezon 
in 1944. Roxas would defeat Osmena for 
the Presidency in 1946. 

Thus far, the only president to have served 
in the House of Representatives following 
her term is Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who 
represents the 2nd District of Pampanga in 
the 15th Congress. 




Sergio Osmena was the first Speaker of the House— one 
of two Philippine Presidents who became Leader of the 
House of Representatives, the other being Manuel Roxas. 
His counterpart in the Senate, Manuel L. Quezon, was one 
of three Presidents of the Philippines who served as Sen- 
ate President.

MIDTERMS: 

THE PRESIDENTIAL 
REFERENDUM 



The midterm election in the Philippines 
is seen as a referendum on the sitting 
administration because they are held 
midway through a presidential administration. 
From the first midterm election in 1938 to the 
most recent one in 2007, the political power 
and clout of presidents have waxed and 
waned with the results of the midterms: in 
particular, on the basis of his allies winning or 
losing the Senate. 

There have been a total of ten midterm 
elections in Philippine political history, though 
a distinction should be made between the 
role of midterms in the Commonwealth 
as well as the Third and Fifth Republics. 
While midterms throughout both eras 
serve as yardsticks by which to measure 
the popularity of an administration, as 
well as public satisfaction and trust, certain 
conditions have changed between then and 
now: constitutionally-set term limits for the 
president, the composition of political parties, 
and the electoral setup of the Senate. 

The Commonwealth began with the president 
elected to a single six-year term, with a 
unicameral National Assembly with a three- 
year term. And so, the first midterm election in 
1938, which resulted in a complete victory for 



the ruling Partido Nacionalista, came midway 
through President Manuel L. Quezon's six- 
year term, which started in 1935. However, 
the 1935 Constitution was amended in 1941 
to change the president's term to four years 
with possible re-election to another four- 
year term. A bicameral legislature was also 
restored, so that in November 1941, the 
president, vice president, and members of the 
House of Representatives were elected to four- 
year terms, while members of the Senate were 
elected to a six-year term. Under the special 
provisions for the 1941 elections, however, 
the president would only serve two out of 
four years (having already been elected to a 
six year term, President Quezon could only 
serve two more years as the amended 1935 
Constitution specified a maximum of eight 
years for any president), while the senators 
drew lots so one third would serve a full six 
years, another third would serve four years, 
and the remaining third would serve two 
years, to allow for staggered terms afterwards. 

After World War II and the establishment of 
the Third Republic in 1946, presidents were 
elected to a four-year term with the possibility 
of re-election, as stated in Section 5, Article 
VII of the amended 1935 Constitution: "No 
person shall serve as President for more than

eight consecutive years." As such, the midterm 
served as the initial salvo in an incumbent 
president's efforts to secure reelection. 
Evidenced by Quirino's and Macapagal's 
poor showing in 1951 and 1963, respectively, 
an administration losing the midterms was 
indicative of impending regime change as both 
lost their re-election bids. 

It could be assumed that the overwhelming 
Liberal Party (LP) victory in 1971, Marcos' 
second midterm, was a considerable threat 
to the ruling party for the 1973 presidential 
elections (as depicted in the editorial cartoon 
on the opposite page). Martial Law was put 
in full force and effect on September 23, 1972, 
thus keeping Marcos in power until he was 
deposed in 1986. 
w 

Victory in the midterms, however, did not 
necessarily translate to re-election for the 
president. While the Nacionalista Party (NP) 
victory in the 1967 midterm elections boosted 
the bid of Marcos to win an unprecedented 
second full term in 1969, the NP win in 1959 
did not result in Garcia's re-election two years 
after. 

Thus, there is a mixed rate of success for 
sitting administrations when it comes to 
midterm polls. In the Third Republic it stood 
at four wins (Roxas, Magsaysay, Garcia, and 
Marcos 1967) and three losses (Quirino, 
Macapagal, and Marcos 1971). 

The 1987 Constitution, under which the 
Fifth Republic operates, limits a presidential 
term to a six years without re-election. 
Midterms then serve as a barometer 
for continued popular support or as a 
legitimizing factor midway through a fixed, 
single presidential term. 



While the Upper House continues to have 24 
senators with six-year terms, the periodicity 
of their election has changed. In the Third 
Republic, senators were elected on a staggered 
basis of eight every two years, making it 
easier for parties to fill up their Senatorial 
slates. With the restoration of the Senate in 
1987 under the Fifth Republic, 24 senators 
were elected to serve until 1992. In 1992, 
another set of 24 senators were elected, the 
first 12 serving a full six-year term, the second 
12 serving only until 1995. From the 1995 
midterm election onward, Senators have been 
elected on a staggered basis of 12 every three 
years, forcing smaller, fragmented parties to 
coalesce in order to fill up a 12-man berth. 

President Corazon C. Aquino did not have a 
midterm election. The first post-Martial Law 
midterm polls were during the administration 
of President Fidel V. Ramos in 1995, resulting 
in a strong win for the administration. The 
Lakas-LABAN administration coalition was 
made up of stalwarts of Ramos's Lakas- 
NUCD and the LABAN ng Demokratikong 
Pilipino (LDP), the party of former House 
Speaker Ramon Mitra Jr., whom Ramos 
defeated for president in 1992. The opposition 
was composed of the Nationalist People's 
Coalition (NPC) and the People's Reform 
Party (PRP) groups led by other defeated 
1992 presidential candidates Amb. Eduardo 
Cojuangco Jr. and Miriam Defensor-Santiago, 
respectively. 

President Joseph Ejercito Estrada did not have 
a midterm election either, as he was removed 
from office before the May 2001 polls. 

The second post-Martial Law midterm 
resulted in the heavy loss of the 
administration's Team Unity in the 2007 



THE PRESIDENTIAL REFERENDUM 



midterms, which affirmed the unpopularity 
of President Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo as she 
entered her sixth year in office. The shallow 
bench of the Arroyo administration's Team 
Unity, primarily made up of Lakas-CMD and 
Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino (KAMPI) 
stalwarts, paled against the powerhouse 
lineup of the Genuine Opposition, a broad 
coalition of anti- Arroyo groups such as the LP, 
a faction of the NPC, NP, Pwersa ng Masang 
Pilipino, and PDP-LABAN. Campaigning 
with the slogan, "Isang boto lang po LABAN 
sa nakaupo" the opposition drove home 
that point that that election was a vote of 
confidence on the Arroyo administration. 

The electorate overwhelmingly favored the 
opposition, with only two of Arroyo's bets 



winning — one being a veteran legislator who 
had challenged Arroyo for the vice presidency 
in 1998 and the other, a maverick senator. 
One more Arroyo ally made it: a congressman 
who later vacated his seat amidst an electoral 
protest that reversed his victory. In hindsight, 
the result of the 2007 midterms was an 
almost complete shutout of the administration 
mirroring the Quirino defeats in 1951 and 
1953. 

The forthcoming 2013 elections will be only 
the third midterm poll in the Fifth Republic 
and the eleventh in Philippine history. Thus 
far, the midterm record for post-EDSA 
administrations stands at one victory (Ramos) 
and one loss (Arroyo). 




THE PRESIDENTIAL REFERENDUM 



The Lakas ng Bayan coalition won 22 of 24 seats in the Senate election of 1987. 



The coalition, a partnership between 
political parties or personalities, has 
been a fixture in Philippine politics 
since the first national presidential election 
in 1935. 

That historic contest pitted the coalition 
composed of the Partido Nacionalista 
Democrata (Antis) and the Partido Pro- 
Independencia Democrata (Pros) against 
two newly created parties, the National 



Socialist Party and the Republican Party. 
Though fierce rivals, Manuel L. Quezon 
(Anti) and Sergio Osmena (Pro) brought 
together an unrivaled network of provincial 
leaders that delivered one of the most 
lopsided electoral victories in Philippine 
history. 

Their coalition would later reunite as the 
Nacionalista Party (NP), win all the seats 
in the 1938 elections for the National 



COALITIONS 



Assembly, and would dominate electoral 
politics in the country until after World 
War II, when the NP-Liberal Wing (later the 
Liberal Party), was established by Senate 
President Manuel Roxas as a vehicle for his 
presidential bid. Roxas faced his mentor 
Osmena, who had brokered a coalition 
between the NP, the Democrata Alliance and 
the Popular Front. Roxas defeated Osmena 
and ushered in a period of two-party 
dominance under the Third Republic (1946- 
1972), with smaller parties joining either 
side to boost their chances at the polls, 
a pattern that was clearly visible during 
presidential elections. Midterm elections 
under the Third Republic, however, would 
largely remain two-party contests. 

The Liberals themselves were split into 
two wings for the 1949 polls, with Senate 
President Jose Avelino forming a separate 
wing within the party to challenge the 
incumbent Elpidio Quirino. While former 
President Jose P. Laurel lost that election, 
the Nacionalistas finally recaptured 
Malacanang four years later with Ramon 
Magsaysay, a Liberal-turned-Nacionalista. 

The elections of 1957, 1959, 1961, and 
1965 would see the emergence and growth 
of the Progressive Party of the Philippines 
(PPP). It contested the presidency twice, in 
1957 with considerable success, and once 
more in 1965. In the 1959 midterms, the 
Progressives coalesced with the opposition 
LP to form the Liberal-Progressive Party; for 
their part, the Nacionalistas coalesced with 
the Nationalist Citizens' Party of Senator 
Lorenzo Tanada. Two years later in 1961, 
the LP and the Grand Alliance formed the 
"United Opposition," a coalition to support 
Vice President Diosdado Macapagal's 



successful presidential run and the LP-PPP 
sweep of the Senate. 

From 1963 to 1971, elections were once 
again contested largely by the NP and LP. 
In the Fourth Republic, coalitions figured 
prominently in the 1978 and 1984 Batasang 
Pambansa elections. Kilusang Bagong 
Lipunan (KBL), President Ferdinand E. 
Marcos's political party, was originally a 
coalition of former Nacionalistas, Liberals, 
and other partisans but grew into a political 
monolith, dominating both elections. Most 
opposition groups boycotted the 1978 
elections, refusing to lend credibility to the 
Marcos dictatorship, but in 1984, a handful 
of anti-Marcos forces coalesced under the 
United Democratic Organization (UNIDO). 

Elections that followed in the Fifth 
Republic have been contested by coalitions 
mainly because of the inability of political 
parties to complete a strong national slate. 
Notably, only senatorial elections from 
1987 onwards have seen the formation of 
short-lived political coalitions, with these 
coalitions being dissolved in the run-up to 
presidential elections. All midterm polls 
in the Fifth Republic have been battles 
between two main, opposing coalitions, 
with the administration party scoring 
victories in 1995 under President Ramos, 
but suffering defeat in 2007 under President 
Arroyo. 

The presidential elections themselves may 
be characterized as a multiparty melee, 
in a reversal of pre-Martial Law political 
trends, which were characterized primarily 
by coalition building ahead of presidential 
elections to consolidate support for one of 
two main contenders. The sheer number of 



COALITIONS 



candidates who contested the presidency in 
1992 (seven), 1998 (10), and 2010 (nine) is 
evident of this shift. 

The 2004 elections, however, was unusual 
since it featured a president running for 
re-election for the first time since 1969. 
The administration, opposition, and a 
band of third-party "alternatives" each 
cobbled together their own coalitions, but 
the contest was largely between Gloria 
Macapagal- Arroyo and Fernando Poe Jr. — a 
throwback to the pre-Martial Law political 
norm of two main political adversaries. 
However, the victor still failed to win a 
majority mandate. 

The trend in the Fifth Republic shows 
presidents elected by a plurality of the 
electorate instead of a clear majority; in 
stark contrast to the Third Republic, where 



only Carlos P. Garcia was elected with less 
than 50% of the vote. 

Coalitions were also formed in the 1987 and 
2001 elections that served as referenda on 
the popular support of the administrations 
that were forged out of EDSA I and EDSA 
Dos. Both President Aquino and Arroyo's 
coalitions won these crucial tests to their 
legitimacy by considerable margins. 

Political coalitions remain and will continue 
to be relevant in the Philippine political 
discourse because the contemporary multi- 
party system results in smaller, weaker 
political parties that have to rely on 
each other to complete a 12-man Senate 
slate every three years. This is further 
complicated by the general lack of party 
loyalty that is both symptom and cause of 
the weakness of Philippine political parties.

coalition of the opposition, the United Nationalist Democratic Organization (UNID0).

A HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY'S 
FOREMOST PUBLIC SQUARE 



DEFEND IT AT PLAZA 
MIRANDA 



Manila, the seat of colonial political power 
in the Philippines, spawned 16 geographical 
districts — known as arabales, or suburbs — 
mostly drawn up during the colonial period. 
One of the busiest and most important of 
these arabales is Quiapo, situated north 
of the Pasig River. Originally a residential 
area for Manilenos with means, the district 
evolved to become Manila's downtown 
from the 1920s to the 1960s — a unique 
and potent melting pot of commerce, and 
entertainment, politics, and religion. 

At the heart of Quiapo is a public square 
known as Plaza Miranda. Little is known, 
however, about the man for whom the plaza 
is named, a certain Jose Sandino Miranda, 
who was secretary of the Treasury between 
1833 and 1854. 

This geographic center of the district has 
seen countless demonstrations throughout its 
long existence — from religious processions 
of devotees of the Black Nazarene to 
gatherings of political partisans. 

Located no more than a kilometer from 
Malacanan Palace, Plaza Miranda was the 
largest venue from which rallyists could 



be physically close to the residence of the 
country's chief executive, whether in loyal 
support or oppositionist denunciation. 
In the era of grand demonstrations and 
mass mobilizations, National Artist for 
Literature Nick Joaquin, in his Almanac 
for Manilenos, described Plaza Miranda as 
"the crossroads of the nation, the forum 
of the land." President Ramon Magsaysay, 
arguably the most popular of our postwar 
chief executives, famously recognized the 
square as a gauge of public opinion when 
he asked a proponent of a policy or project: 
"Can we defend this at Plaza Miranda?" Far 
removed from the closed, air-conditioned 
rooms of Congress or cushioned seats 
in public buildings, bringing an issue to 
Plaza Miranda was the ultimate act of 
transparency and accountability, where the 
people, any Juan or Juana de la Cruz, could 
question their government. 

In the half century that Plaza Miranda 
served as the country's foremost public 
square, three events stand out. The 1946 
presidential elections pitted incumbent 
President Sergio Osmena against his protege- 
turned-rival Senate President Manuel Roxas. 
Osmena, upholding traditionalist notions 



PLAZA MIRANDA 126 



from the prewar era, refused to campaign 
and delivered a solitary yet scathing speech 
in Plaza Miranda: 



"(S)o I am here before you, to see 
me, to listen to me. Probably my 
hair is grayer than it was a year 
ago, but I assure you that this 
was not because of worry about 
the elections, but rather because 
of my grave responsibilities and 
preoccupations concerning our 
country, so rashly imperiled by the 
big ambitions of small men. . . " 



Osmena lost the election to Roxas, 
founder of the breakaway wing of the old 
Nacionalista Party that would eventually 
become the Liberal Party (LP), who 
mounted a nationwide campaign, going 



house-to-house, and giving stump speeches 
in town plazas. Barely a year into his term, 
Roxas also delivered an important speech in 
Plaza Miranda — rallying the Liberal Party 
to support the Parity Agreement to the 
1935 Constitution, which granted American 
citizens equal rights with Filipino nationals 
in the use of national natural resources. Just 
as the president finished speaking, a man 
lobbed a grenade on the stage, prompting 
General Mariano Castaneda to kick it away 
and cover President Roxas with his body. 
The grenade landed near the audience, 
killing two and wounding a dozen people. 

Two decades later, after President Marcos 
won re-election in 1969, only to plunge in 
popularity as the peso was devalued and 
inflation and student demonstrations rocked 
the land, the sons of Presidents Osmena and 
Roxas united under the LP, in opposition 
to President Ferdinand Marcos. Senators

"Gerry" Roxas. (Photo courtesy of the Gerry Roxas Foundation.) 



Sergio Osmena Jr. and 
Gerardo Roxas both figured 
in the third, perhaps most 
infamous, incident in Plaza 
Miranda, which would 
indelibly link the Liberal 
Party of the Philippines to 
Plaza Miranda's identity 
as the forum of Philippine 
democracy. 

The political situation in 
Manila and throughout the 
country was at a fever pitch. 
Growing disenchantment 
with Marcos put his 
political future at stake 
with the 1971 midterm 
senatorial elections, the 
traditional dividing line 
between continued political 
relevance or a reduction to 
political lameduckhood for 
an incumbent. 

On August 21, 1971, at 
the miting de avance of 
the Liberal Party in Plaza 
Miranda, the square 
became the scene of two 
simultaneous grenade 
attacks that nearly 
liquidated the party's 
leadership, just as Senator 
Roxas, Liberal Party 
president, was proclaiming 
his party's local candidates 
for the City of Manila. 

Among those seriously 
injured were Roxas, 
Osmena, Senators 



Jovito Salonga, Genaro 
Magsaysay, Eva Estrada- 
Kalaw (Nacionalista guest 
candidate of the LP), and 
senatorial bets John Henry 
Osmena and Ramon Mitra 
Jr. 

Roxas would hold President 
Marcos responsible for the 
attack: 

"The Plaza Miranda 
incident has illustrated 
beyond doubt that there 
is not a safe place in the 
country where people 
may express their views 
without having to face the 
perils of assassination. I 
have only one message to 
leaders, followers and the 
electorate: Nothing will 



deter the LP nor dampen 
its determination to win the 
mandate of the people this 
election. We shall continue 
to fight for the right of our 
citizenry. I am grateful to 
the Almighty for those of us 
who were fortunate to have 
been spared." 

Widely considered as 
the most blatant assault 
on free speech and 
guaranteed democratic 
rights at the time, many 
quarters believed it to be 
masterminded by Marcos 
himself, which led to 
increased opposition to 
his administration. Three 
months later, the polls 
resulted in a Senate sweep 
by the Liberals, with only

two Marcos allies making 
it into the winner's circle. 
The president's alter egos — 
Defense Minister Juan 
Ponce Enrile and Secretary 
of Labor Bias Ople — were 
among the losers. 

Edward R. Kiunisala, in 
his article "The Outrage," 
published in the Philippines 
Free Press, wrote: 



"It will take a long 
time before Plaza 
Miranda, the symbol 
of free expression, will 
be as it used to be. No 
one will ascend the 
Plaza Miranda stage 
again without fearing 
for his life. How much 
of the militancy, the 
courage, the national 
pride and the spirit 
of the Filipino people 
have gone that Black 
Saturday at Plaza 
Miranda?" 



The 1971 Plaza Miranda 
Bombing was, in a way, the 
square's last hurrah as the 
country's foremost stage 
for political discourse. With 
the advent of mass media, 
which allowed candidates 
to reach a wide audience 
through television or the 
radio, political rallies 



have been reserved for 
proclamations or the 
traditional miting de 
avance. While no longer 
the grandest nor most 
prominent political forum, 



Plaza Miranda continues 
to remind Filipinos that 
Philippine democracy was 
not only restored in 1986, 
but is alive and free.

THE EVOLUTION OF THE 

PHILIPPINE LEGISLATURE 



This is a graphical representation of the evolution of the Philippine 
Legislature — from the the establishment of the Malolos Congress in 1898 
to the present Congress restored following the 1987 Constitution. It traces 
the development of representative democracy in the Philippines through 
its unicameral and bicameral forms, significant events that shaped and 
determined the institutions, across the historical eras of the Government of 

the Philippines.
