GENERAL conditiort 
in the Philippine I«- 
landt during August 
were practically a continua- 
tion of late July trexidt. 
confirming the lost of the 
"new levelt" of Jun? and 
early July to far as export 
prt<^ are concerned. Variout 
reasons have bem assigned: 
(1) The early summer in- 
creases in Philippine export 
commodity prices reflected 
an exaggerated estimate of (a) dollar (and with it, 
peso) inflation, (b) increase in costs under National 
Recovery and Agricultural Adjustment Adminis- 
trations, and (c) proximity of full recovery; (2) The 
uncertain position of Philippine sugar, cordage, 
tobacco and lumber under pending marketing agree- 
ments which restricted sales for future delivery, thus 
throwing greater pressure on spot marketing; (3) 
Usual dullness of the rainy season; (4) Heavy pro- 
duction in major items (unprecedented in copra, 
heavy in abaca and sugar). 

In spite of the August slump, the undertone is 
optimistic. Cordage and other manufacturers feel 
that the lower dollar has helped export. The general 
public shows better morale and expects NRA codes 
and Agricultural Adjustment to work out for the 
benefit of all producers. 

Provincial movement of merchandise was low 
even for August and there is a distinct feeling among 
dealers that the conservative peasantry has ceased 
resistance and accepted a new and much lower stand- 
ard of living, especially in respect to consumption 
of overseas wares. However, merchants expect an 
upturn in late September and October, response to 
opening of the sugar milling season. 

A veritable "gold boom" struck the Islands during 
August featured by a great activity in prospecting 
and exploratory work centering around Baguio. and 
in feverish trading in stocks and certificates in Manila. 
The advance in gold stock quotations was checked 
by the uncertainty of whether United States author- 
ities would declare an open market for bullion. As 
it became rumored that the embargo would be lifted, 
the market turned highly speculative. 

Construction activity was seasonally dull but 
slightly better than a year ago. Manila permits — 
practically all residential — were ^380,000 compared 
with ^557.000 in July and ^352.000 in August 1932. 

Finance 

Government finances, by no means comfortable, 
nevertheless reflected the wholesome results of the 
1932 and 1933 decreased budgets and of the Governor- 
Qeneral's staimch attitude for further economy not 
only for management of 1933 outgo but for his 1934 
budget which is without recourse to the small surplus 
account. Internal revenue collection for Manila 
(over 70 per cent of the total for the Islands) was 18 
per cent over August last year. Land tax payments 
continued heavily in arrears in several districts to the 
detriment of ordinary disbursements of municipal 
and provincial governments. 

Banking conditions were not seriously changed 
from July. There were increases in resources and in 
investments; decreases in loans, working capital of 
foreign banks, and in average daily debits.

Sugar 

The sugar market was stagnant. The old crop was 
exhausted and the uncertainty surrounding the 
Philippine quota under the pending United States 
marketing agreement restrained dealing in futures 
on the new crop. General prices opened at F8.00, 

?icul ez-godown, advanced to F8.10, dropped to 
►7.90, recovered to P8.10 at close. Near the close, 
llodo exporters made fair deals in new crop lots on 
the basis of W.25, December- March delivery. 

The Philippine Sugar Association's estimate for 
the 1933-34 campaign which opens November 1. 
next, is slightly under l.SOO.OOO short tons. Exports 
from November 1, 1932 to August 31, 1933 totaled 
992,985 long tons of centrifugal and 53,376 long tons 
of refined. 

Coconut Products 

In the absence of notable dollar-peso exchange 
fluctuations, the August copra market was influenced 
only by natural factors. Prices sagged due to an 
all-time record for receipts at Manila and Ce bu «k 1 
no - compensating incftase in demand for "copra, 
coupled with declines in United States coconut oil 
quotations. Crushing was active but some mills 
reached tank space limits. The cake market con- 
tinued stagnant and felt the effect of increased duty 
rates in Sweden. Similar increases were reported 
in prospect in Norway.

Abaca 

The market for abaca declined in the first fortnight 
bat steadied towards the close. Transactions wcr« 
limited to a small scale due to lack of demand from 
the United States and Japan. Prices fell from F1.7S 
to P2.2S per picul in the upper grades; from Fl.OO 
to P2.00 m the medium and lower. Prospects are 
not bright in view of eztraordiiuuily heavy receipts.

Palay and rice trading was well sustained at a fair 
volume during August. Palay prices ranged nar>

Tobacco 

Approximately two-thirds of the present crop was 
reported sold. The quality is reputed to be un- 
satisfactory. Estimated August exports of rawleaf,

News Summary 

The Philippines 



Aug. t7. — Over strenuous 
opposition from the Osmefia- 
Roxas group, the House adopts 
the independence resolution 
prompted by the Woihinoion 
Pont editorial stating that the 
Filipinos were putting sugar 
before independence. Senator 
Osmefta contends that the 
Hawes-Cutting-Hare Act gives 
immediate independence, as the 
word "immediate" should not be taken literally as 
meaning this moment. The resolution declares that 
the Hawes Act does not provide for immediate 
independence, and that the "ideal of the Filipino 
people is and always has been immediate, complete, 
and absolute independence" and that the "achieve- 
ment of this ideal has always been the principal 
concern of the Legislature". 

The Qovernot -General signs the bill providing 
emergency funds to keep all public elementary schools 
in operation until the end of the year. 

Qovemor-Oeneral Frank Murphy proclaims a 
"Made-in-the-Philippines" week, and the Manila 
Trading Center and Exchange is formally opened. ^ 

AuQ. 18. — A plebiscite plan as regards the Hawes 
Act is approved by the majority caucus and the 
Osmefta-Roxas faction endorses it in principle but 
objects to the proposed three questions, holding that 
there should be only one question, "Are you in favor 
of the Independence Law (The Hare-Hawes-Cutting 
Act)?" to be answered by yes or no. The group also 
advocates that the plebiscite be made binding upon 
the Legislature. 

Au{/. 19. — Senate President Manuel Queson 
observes his S5tn birthday anniversary. 

Manuel Camus, head of the Philippine delegation 
to the conference of the Institute of Pacific Relations 
being held at BaniT, Cfnada, states that the 
Japanese would be the only persons who would 
bmefit by Philippine independence and that "ac- 
ceptance of the Hawes Act was being retarded by 
fear". 

The House passes a budget bill of P42,238,194, 
less by P24 1,665 than the bill proposed by the Qov- 
emor-Oeneral. The chamber reduced its own ap- 
propriation by P72,488, itemised the appropriations 
for the University of the Philippines, and reduced 
the salaries of the resident commissioners from Pl2,- 
000 to P6,000. 

Aug. XI. — Miuor-Oeneral Frank Parker, com- 
mander of the Sixth Corps Area at Chicago, is named 
to succeed Major-Oeneral Swing B. Booth as com- 
mander of the Philippine Department. 

At a hearing called in Washington to discuss milk 
by-products it is declared that the Philippines is 
sending a flood of coconut oil to the United States 
and that if duties can not be levied on this because 
of the political status of the Islands, the "Blue Eagle" 
should be put on the Philippines, placing the Philip- 
pines on the same wage basis as the Uftited States. 
The blue eagle is the symbol of the Roosevelt ad- 
ministration's campaign to put all industries under 
codes of fair competition providing for minimum 
wages, maximum hours, and fair prices. 

AiiO' — ^The Osmefia-Roxas faction attacks the 
Sison-Hilario plebiscite bill as "malicious and dis- 
honest in its plan and execution" and objects to 
inserting in the ballot "capricious interpretations of 
the Hawes Law". The bill proposes three questions: 

(1) "Are you in favor of absolute and complete in- 
dependence within five years, without any militarv, 
naval, or other reservations of the United States?" 

(2) "Are you for the acceptance of the Hawes-Cut- 
ting-Hare Act exactly as It is, that is to say (here 
follows a summary of the terms of the law). . . ." 

(3) "Are you in favor of the Hawes-Cutting-Hare 



Act with all its objectkmabk fectares, provldgd tlit 
Legialatiire or the CoQftltutkmal conventkm iHtt 
secure amendments with reference to (a) mVQMUt 
and other reaervationt, (b) length of time prior to 
independanct, (c) its immigratioa, economic, and 
other objectionable provisions**. 

Aug. »4. — The Senate passes the Qovernor-Oen- 
eral's budget with only minor changes, tha bU 
carrying a toUl of P4a,47S,439, and restoring the 
lump appropriation for the University. Mr. Qaeaoo 
insisted on the reduction of his salary from P16,000 
to P14,000, which, minus the IS^ economy radue- 
tion, is PI 1,900, the salary of tna Speaker of the 
House being reduced to a similar amount. The 
Senate and House bills now go to a Joint committee. 

The National convention plan is gaining nouad 
in the Legislature as time for arranging a pm>iscite 
is growing short. Mr. Queson states that unless 
a plebiscite law can be agreed upon shortly, there 
will be no time left to go tnrough the plebiscite 
process. Both the Senate and the House are working 
on plebiscite bills, but there is much disagreement. 
Osmefta states that he favors the convention plan 
in principle and denies that his group is filibustermg. 

Mr. Queson at a meeting of the Board of Regents 
of the University states that the Universi^ exceed- 
ed its authority in closing the School of Dentistry 
last year without consulting the Legislature and de- 
clared that the School will be reopened this year. 
He tells the Board that the appropriations for the 
colleges of law and education should be reduced 
and there are already too many lawvers and teach- 
ers in proportion to the other professions and the 
needs of the country, and advocates that the 
University should turn its attention more to the 
teaching of mining and industrial engineering. He 
also advises discontinuance of the building program.

Sept. The House passes the plebiscite resolution 
whicn prepares the way for the discussion of the 
plebiscite bill itself. The resolution states that in- 
asmuch as the members of the Legislature were 
elected under a "mandate to worlc for immediate, 
complete, and absolute independence" and the Hawes 
Act does "not provide for this" and iu provisions 
are "not in accord with the specific instructions" 
sent fay the Legislature to the Mission, no action 
can be taken without first obtaininc the "people's 
sanction", and that therefore a plebiscite will be 
hdd "to find out the actual desire of the Filipino 
people". The action followed a three-day speech 
by Representative Delgado, author of the resolution. 

Representative John D. Dingell, of Michigan, on a 
brief visit to the Philippines, tells the Legislature 
"I stand four-square upon the party platform. . . . 
Your decision (on the Hawes Act) will be my guide 
in tile ^ture. ... I shall do in my small part and 
in my humble way everything and anything that is 
possible, takinginto consideration the welfare of the 
people of the Philippines. I am deeply concerned 
m fair play. . . 

Sept. 6. — ^Lieut. J. F. Barbajera, ConsUbulary 

Ktrol leader, and six enlisted men, and a Moro out- 
V leader, Mahamud and eleven of his followers, are 
killed in a skirmish at Bud Panamao, Jolo, where 
Lieutenant Alagar and eleven of his men met their 
death last October. Lieutenants Deang and Ro- 
drigues were wounded. 

Sept. 7. — Amando Avancefia, president of the 
Federation of Negros Sugar Planters, returning from 
Washington, where he attended the sugar limitation 
.conference, declares himself in favor of rejecting the 
Hawes Act, stating that it will be easier to secure a 
better bill than to get amendments to the Hawes Act. 

Judge Juan Sumulong states tiiat a national con- 
vention is preferable to a plebiscite because the 

3uestion is so complex that it should be left to a 
eliberative body like the Legislature or a special 
convention. 

Sept. 9. — It is announced that the Benguet Con- 
solidated Mining Company has concluded an ar- 
rangement with the Plorannie Mining Company 
whereby the former will undertake to mine certain 
chrome deposits near Lagonoy, Camarines Sur, 
bringing a new industry to the Philippines. The 
deposit, discovered last year, is the only known source 
of chromium under the United States flag. The 
metal when added to steel makes it rustless and is 
used in the manufacture of military and other equip- 
ment. The United States imported some 212,000 
tons of the metal in 1931. most of which came from 
South Africa and New Caledonia. 

Senatoi Sergio Osmefia observes his SSth birth- 
day anniversary. 

Sept. /O.— With the departure of Major-Qeneral 
Booth, Brigadier-General Stanley H. Ford assumes 
command of the Philippine Department. 

The United States 

Aug. 19. — President Roosevelt signs the steel, oil, 
and lumber codes, which will result in the employment 
of some 400,000 men in new jobs. The oil code was 
drawn up by General Hugh S. Johnson himself after 
long controversy and failure on the part of the pro- 
ducers to agree. 

Aug. £e. — The President instructs Norman H. 
Davis to return to Geneva for tne world disarmament 
conference, which reconvenes on October 16, to sup- 
port the French proposal for an international com- 
mission to supervise and control aims manufacture 
throughout the world; the plan of Premier MacDonald 
to eliminate weapons of offense; and also the stand 
by tne former United Ststes offer to participate in 
the security and consultative pact which the French 
demanded in exchange for arms reduction. 

Aug. £4. — ^The code of fair competition for retail 
stores is completed, said to be the greatest trade 
agreement ever made and affecting 1,500,000 retailers 
and their employees. 

Theslaughtvr of 5,000,000 hogs, principally sows and 
immature young swine, in the Middle West is begun 
in order to raise retail prices. The meat will be 
given to relief agencies. 

Aug. 96. — The automobile industry's code is ap- 
proved by the President. 

Aug. 27. — General Johnson asked the American 
people "to buy under the Blue Eagle" but to abstain 
from "boycott, intimidation, and violence". 

Prof. Raymond Moley, intimate adviser of the 
President, resigns as assistant secretary of state, 
effective next month. 

Aug. £9.— General Johnson warns Henry Ford 
that unless he joins the rest of the industry under the 
automobile code, "the people may crack down on 
him". "No corporation is rich enough to block the 
nation. There is a popular uprising that is deter- 
mined to make the recovery program a success". 

The President lifts the embargo on shipments of 
gold from the United States to permit the sale of 
newly-mined gold abroad, a move which will add 
millions in profits to gold producers in the United 
States and other regions under the flag. Restrictions 
against hoarding, however, are increased. 

Officials of the National Recovery Administration 
inform the executives of the insular tenitories and 
possessions of the United States, including the Philip- 
pines, that if their industries wish to come under the 
mdustiial control program, they would be gladly 
heard, but that no attempt will be made to compel 
them to come into line as it is recognised that con- 
ditions, especially in the Philippines and Puerto Rico, 
differ greatly. 

Aug. SI. — Secretary of War Dcm states that the 
$80,000,000 program, for building military aircraft 
and mechanixing the army has been postponed 
pending the outcome of the Geneva conference. He 
appeared disappointed and said: "It would have 

given us the kind of aimy we ought to have as well as 
eing useful as a public works measure". The an- 
nouncement is interpreted to mean that the United 
States will make one more effort to achieve some 
measure of disarmament.

Other Countries 

Aug. ts. — Japanese representatives at the con- 
feience of the Institute of Pacific Relations propose a 
new peace agreements for the Pacific based on the 
acceptance of the present stslus. The Chinese 
delegates say that the plan would have been satisfac- 
tory had not Japan violated various treaties and the 
covenant of tne League of Nations by its actions in 
Manchuria. Until this wrong has been righted and 
Manchukuo has been abolished, China will not be a 
party to any such proposal. Delegates to the con- 
ferencv are said to agree that war is inevitable in the 
Pacific within the next few vears unless government 
codperate to solve the rapidly growing complexities 
and conflicts.

When Man Wants Gold 

By Frank Lewis Minton 



THE greatest gold rush and mining stock boom 
in the history of the Philippine Islands is 
now in progress. Over a dozen new mining, 
exploration, and development companies have 
been formed, or are now in process of organization, 
all within the current year. In the larger sense, the 
reason for the gold rush, which is not confined to the 
Philippines, but covers every gold producing country, 
is that the nations of the world need gold— much gold — and 
they are willing to pay a premium to get it. And when 
man wants gold, men will produce it. 

The story of our own little gold rush is both amusing 
and romantic, but that story has no place in this article. 
Suffice it to say that the Philippine boom was started on 
paper. It began as a tiny whirlwind, and has swelled to the 
proportions of a teapot tempest. There are over thirty 
mining stock brokerage offices in Manila today, all of which 
are very active, although mostly in small transactions. 
Speculators eagerly await the launching of new mining 
projects on the exchange, hoping to get shares at par value, 
take advantage of the flurry which usually follows the 
advent of new projects in the mart, and sell out their in- 
terests at profits ranging from fifty to three hundred per 
cent. The more conservative and far sighted investors 
also await new stock issues, but they buy only with greater 
knowledge of values, and are not concerned over the super- 
ficial flurries that cause daily fluctuations in the ''board" 
values of stocks. 

A number of new gold discoveries have been reported 
during the past few months. Some of these are not actually 
new, but have been made during the past twenty to thirty 
years by men who were unaware of their true value, unable 
to exploit them, and unwilling to invite the cooperation 
of capital on the prevailing terms. One of these, the Bued 
River project, which includes an original site located many 
years ago, reports the finding of concentrated bed-rock 
deposits worth two thousand dollars gold per cubic meter, 
and sand running eight hundred dollars gold per cubic 
meter. The Bontoc prospectors report a considerable 
area of placer sand averaging thirteen dollars and fifty 
cents per cubic meter. 




The operations in Bontoc have precipitated a 
miniature war between the non-Christian Igorots 
inhabiting that district, and the prospectors, in 
which bloodshed was narrowly averted by the 
interference of the Constabulary. As a result of 
this conflict, operations have been temporarily 
suspended, pending arbitration of the Insular Government 
to establish the respective rights of the disputants. 

The fact that the Philippine Islands are highly mineral- 
ized has been known to a few geologists, and others, for 
more than twenty years; but among the rank and file the 
erroneous belief still largely obtains that the only important 
gold producing areas are in the mountain provinces of 
Luzon, and that all the richest deposits are controlled by 
two or three companies. In truth, the Philippine Archi- 
pelago has many gold-bearing districts, from the northern- 
most point of Luzon to the southernmost tip of Mindanao. 
Mindoro is known to be highly mineralized. On this 
latter island, one company is already producing gold, and 
several new sites have recently been staked. 

Even with our limited development, the Philippines has 
exported since 1899, the sum of P47, 747,028 in gold, up to 
December 31, 1932. Of this amount $41,692,156 was in 
bullion, and $434,542 in gold-bearing ore. Only $5,520,330 
of the total was in gold coins. The following table gives

In June, 1932, the World's Work reported that the 
Balatok mine, sixty -five per cent of which is owned by the 
Benguet Consolidated Company, paid the highest dividend 
per ton of milled ore of any mine in the world. In 1916 
the Benguet Consolidated paid its first dividend, of $50,- 
000.00. Yet gold mining failed to create more than a 
casual interest among Manila residents, and practically 
none in the provinces. Why? 

Well, in the Philippines, prior to the post-war trade 
slump, it was too easy for us to make money in less stren- 
uous lines of endeavor. One opened a store, ordered goods 
at, for example, Pi. 00 per unit of value. These goods one 
promptly sold at, say, P4.00 per unit. Most merchants 
made money because they could not do otherwise unless 
they threw away their money in riotous living, or loaned 
it on insufficient security — or — mistaking the requirements 
of this market, ordered large stocks of goods unsuited to 
the needs or tastes of the local consumer. 

Then came the depression which, with the exception of 



some spasmodic fluctuations, has grown steadily worse. 
Hundreds of merchants in our over-crowded business com- 
munity went bankrupt, absconded, or wisely closed their 
doors while they still possessed a small cash reserve. Two 
years ago we thought the depression had reached its lowest 
ebb. It had not. A little later a pioneer broker started 
out to sell stock in mining development projects. Even- 
tually the idea caught on. It was a chance to make money, 
when there was no money in the merchandising game. 

Within a few months many Manila businessmen were 
buying gold mining stock. Some were even organizing 
mining companies, and financing prospecting projects. 
At present not less than five new Mining concerns are in 
process of organization, or re-organization. And it is not 
difficult to find capital. Today it is easier to finance a 
gold mining project than any other. 

On the whole, the gold mining boom has been beneficial. 
It has put hoarded money into circulation, has increased 
retail trade. Best of all it has made us **gold conscious", 
has awakened to the idea of developing one of our most 
important resources. Doubtless some will lose in the 
scramble for easy money; but just as surely others will win. 
And the wealth of the silent hills will be brought forth, 
commerce and industry will revive, and quiet old Manila 
will again become a thriving city. 



The Hinal-o or Pestle Dance 



By Beato A. de la Cruz 



THE Hinal'O or Pestle Dance was at one 
time very popular among the people of t. 
the South, especially in the northwestern f 
Visayan provinces. The dance takes its name ^ 
from the hal-o or pestle, ordinarily used for 
pounding rice in a mortar, but used in this 
strange and dangerous dance with remarkable skill by the 
performers. 

I saw the dance for the first time in the small town of 
Malinao in Aklan, Capiz. One Saturday in August, 
during the harvest season, I had been invited to a limbok 
party in one of the barrios of that municipality. Limbok, 
by the way, is a delicacy made from young rice grains, first 
mildy toasted and browned and then pounded in a mortar 
until grain of rice has been flattened out and the husks 
eliminated. It is especially delicious with a little cow*s milk 
or the milk of the coconut and sugar. 

After a delightful repast, the young men and women 
present decided to hold a sort of a **program**. There 
were songs artd such folk-dances at the Tio Doroy, the Dan- 
dansoy, and the Lolay, and then, after a special announce- 
ment, came the Hinal-o or Pestle Dance. 

First, four of the pestles used in making the limbok we 
had eaten were brought into a circular cleared space in 
the midst of the eager onlookers. Those in front had to 
squat down to give the people in the rear a chance to view 
the performance. Children were lifted on their fathers* 
shoulders. Those in the house hung out of the windows or 




were crowded on the outside stairs, and a number of 
spectators found seats in nearby trees. 

Four well-built young men now stepped forward, 
dressed in brightly colored camisas and short red 
pants. Bowing proudly to the crowd and smiling 
at the applause that greeted them, they arranged 
the four pestles, placing two short pestles parallel on the 
ground, about four or five feet apart, and laying two other 
longer pestles on top of them to make a rectangle. 

Two of the men now crouched at the two ends of the 
rectangle and each lifted his ends of the two long pestles, 
one in his left and the other in his right hand, and dropped 
them with a bang on the two short pestles upon which they 
had rested, producing a rich, agreeable sound. 

Then the other two men, who were the real dancers, 
took a standing position, one at each side of the rectangle, 
but at opposite ends and not directly facing each other. 
They were ready for the dance in which a misstep would 
lame them for life. 

An old man with a guitar and a still mellow voice began 
a lively song in three-four time about a certain legendary 
personage in the all but lost folklore of the people. 

The two crouching men lifted the heavy pestles a foot or 
so above the ground, struck them together two times, and 
then brought them down against the other two short 
pestles lying stationary on the ground. Then up came the

Midsummer 



By Baldomero Estabillo 



HE pulled down his hat until the wide brim touched 
his shoulders. He crouched lower under the cover 
of his cart and peered ahead. The road seemed to 
writhe under the lash of the noon -day heat; it swung from 
side to side, and humped and bent itself like a fleeing serp)ent, 
and disappeared behind the spur of a low hill on which 
grew a scrawny thicket of bamboo. 

There was not a house in sight. Along the left side of 
the road ran the deep dry gorge of a stream, the banks 
sparsely covered by sun -burned cogon grass. In places, the 
rocky, waterless bed showed aridly. Farther, beyond the 
shimmer of quivering heat waves 
rose ancient hills not less blue 
than the cloud -palisaded sky. 
On the right stretched a sandy 
waste of low rolling dunes. 
Scattered clumps of hardy ledda 
relieved the otherwise barren 
monotony of the landscape. Far 
away he could discern a thin 
indigo line that was the sea. 

The grating of the cartwheels 
on the pebbles of the road and 
the almost soundless shuffle of 
the weary bull but emphasized 
the stillness. Now and then 
came the dry rustling of falling 
earth as lumps from the cracked 
sides of the gorge rolled down 
to the bottom. 

He struck at the bull with 
the slack of the rope. The 
animal broke into a heavy trot. 
The dust stirred slumbrously. 
The bull stopped after a short 
distance, threw up his head, 
and a glistening thread of saliva 
spun out into the dry air and vanished abruptly. The 
driving rays of the sun were reflected in points of light on 
the wet, heaving flanks. 

The man in the cart did not notice the woman until she 
had rounded the spur of land and stood unmoving beside 
the road, watching the cart and its occupant come toward 
her. She was young, barefoot, and surprisingly sweet 
and fresh amidst her parched surroundings. A gayly 
striped headkerchief covered her hair, the ends tied at the 
nape of her neck. She wore a homespun bodice of light 
red cloth with small white checks. Her skirt was also 
homespun and showed a pattern of white checks with 
narrow stripes of yellow and red. With both hands she 
held by the mouth a large, apparently empty, water jar, 
the cool red of which blended well with her dress. 

She stood straight and still beside the road and regarded 
him with unfeigned curiosity. Suddenly she turned and 
quickly disappeared into the dry gorge. Coming to where 




she had stood a few moments before, he pulled up the bull 
and got out of the cart. He saw where a narrow path had 
been cut into the bank. Pushing back his hat, he stood a 
while lost in thought, absently wiping the perspiration from 
his face. Coming to a decision he unhitched his bull and for 
a few moments, with strong brown fingers, kneaded the hot 
neck of the beast. Then, driving the animal before him, 
he followed the path. It led up the dry bed of the stream. 
There was no sign of the young woman. The hot rocks 
scorched his feet. 

He came upon her beyond a bend in the gorge, where a 
big mango tree, which had partly 
fallen from the side of the 
ravine, cast its cool shade over 
a well. 

She had filled her jar and was 
rolling the headkerchief around 
her hand. She placed the flat 
coil on her head for the jar to 
rest on. Without as much as 
glancing at him, where he had 
stopped some distance off, she 
sat down on her haunches be- 
fore the jar, gathering the folds 
of her skirt between her wide- 
spread knees. She tilted the 
brimful jar to remove part of 
the water. One hand on the 
rim, the other supporting the 
bottom, she began to raise 
the jar to her head. She knelt 
on one knee, resting for a mo- 
ment the jar on the other while 
she brushed away drops of 
water from the sides. In one 
lithe movement, she brought 
the jar onto her head, getting 
to her feet at the same time. But she staggered a little 
and water from the jar splashed down on her breast. The 
single bodice instantly clung to her bosom, molded the 
twin hillocks of her breasts warmly brown through the wet 
cloth. One arm remained uplifted holding the jar, while 
the other shook the clinging cloth free of her drenched flesh. 
Then not once having raised her eyes, she passed by the 
young man who had stood mutely gazing beside his bull. 
The animal had found some grass beside the path and was 
industriously grazing. 

He turned to watch the graceful figure beneath the jar 
until it vanished around the bend in the path leading to the 
road. Then he led the bull to the well, and tethered it to a 
root of the mango tree. 

**The underpart of her arm is white and smooth," he said 
to his blurred image on the waters of the well as he leaned 
over before lowering the bucket made of a petroleum can. 

183 



From n j)(iiniin(f 6// Frrnamlo AmorHolo 

The Girl with the Jar 



"And her ha*\t \8 thick and black". The bucket struck with 
a rattling impact. It filled with one long gurgle. He threw 
his hat on the grass and pulled the bucket up with both 
hands. The twisted bamboo rope bit into his hardened 
palms. He took a moment to wonder how the same rope 
must hurt her. 

He placed the dripping bucket on a flat stone. The bull 
drank. "Son of lightning!" he said, thumping the side 
of the bull after he had drunk the third bucketful, "you 
drink like the great Kabimtitiao!" A low, rich rumbling 
rolled through the cavernous body of the beast. He led 
him again to the tree and tied him to the root, and the 
animal idly rubbed his horns against the wood. The sun 
had fallen from the perpendicular and noticing that the 
bull stood partly exposed to the sun, he pushed him farther 
into the shade. He fanned himself with his hat. He 
whistled to entice the wind from the sea, but not a breeze 
stirred. 

After a while he put on his hat and hurriedly walked the 
short distance through the gorge up to the road where his 
cart stood. From inside he took a jute sack which he slung 
over one shoulder. With the other arm, he gathered part 
of the hay at the bottom of the cart. He returned to the 
well, slips of straw falling behind him as he picked his way 
from one tuft of grass to another, for the broken rocks of 
the path had grown unbearably hot to his bare feet. 

He gave the hay to the bull. Its rump was again in the 
sun, and he had to push it back. "Fool, do you want to 
broil yourself alive?" he said good-humoredly, slapping the 
thick haunches. It switched its long-haired tail and fell 
to eating. The dry, sweet -smelling hay made a gritting 
sound as the hungry animal chewed away. Saliva rolled 
out from the comers of his mouth, clung to the stiff hairs 
that fringed the thick lower lip, fell and gleamed and eva- 
porated in the heated air. 

He took out of the jute sack a polished coconut shell. 
The top had been sawed off and holes bored at opposite 
sides through which a string tied to the lower part of the 
shell passed in a loop. The smaller piece could be slid up 
and down as cover. The coconut shell contained cooked 
rice still a little warm. Buried on the top was an egg now 
boiled hard. He next brought out a bamboo tube of salt, 
a cake of brown sugar wrapped in banana leaf, and some 
dried shrimps. Then he spread the sack in what remained 
of the shade, placed his simple repast thereon, and prepared 
to eat his dinner. But first he drew a bucketful of water 
from the well, which he set on a rock. He seated himself 
on another rock and ate with his fingers. From time to 
time he drank from the bucket. 

He was half through his meal when the girl came down 
the path once more. He watched her with lowered head 
as she approached. He felt a difficulty in continuing to eat, 
but went through the motions of filling his mouth never- 
theless. He strained his eyes looking at the girl from 
beneath his eyebrows. How graceful she was! Her hips 
tapered smoothly down to rounded thighs and supple legs, 
showing through her skirt and moving straight and free. 
Her shoulders, small but firm, bore her shapely neck and 
head with shy pride. 

When she was very near, he ate more hurriedly so that he 
almost choked. He did not look at her. She reached the 



well at last. She placed the jar between three stones. 
When she picked up the rope of the bucket, he came to 
himself. He looked up — straight into her face. He saw 
only her eyes. They were brown and they were regarding 
him very gravely, without embarrassment. She returned 
his gaze with such fearlessness that he himself forgot his 
timidity. 

"Won't you join me, ading?" he said simply. He re- 
mained seated. 

Her lips parted in a half smile and a dimple appeared 
momentarily on her right cheek. She shook her head and 
said: "God reward you, znanong.*' 

"Perhaps the poor food I have is not fit for you?" 

"No, no. It isn't that. How can you think of it? I 
would be ashamed. It is that I have just eaten myself. 
That is why I come to get water in the middle of the day — 
we ran out of it suddenly. I see you have eggs and shrimps 
and sugar. Why, we had nothing but rice and salt." 

"Salt? Surely you joke." 

"I would be ashamed ..." 

"But what is the matter with salt? 

'Salt, salt, salt 

Makes the baby stout' " 

he intoned. "My grandmother used to sing that to me 
when I complained of our food." 

They laughed as at a joke. They felt more at ease and 
regarded each other more openly. He took a long time 
fingering his rice before raising it to his mouth, the while he 
gazed up at her and smiled for no reason at all. She smiled 
back in turn and gave the rope which she held an absent- 
minded tug. The bucket came down from its perch of rock 
in a miniature flood. He leaped to his feet with a surprised 
yell and the next instant the jute sack on which lay his meal 
was drenched. Only the rice inside the coconut shell and 
the cake of sugar which he was on the point of eating were 
saved from being soaked in the water. 

She was distressed, but he only laughed. 

"It is nothing," he said. "It was time I stopped eating. 
I am filled up to my neck." 

"Forgive me, manong,'' she insisted. "It was all my 
fault. Such a clumsy creature I am." 

"It was not your fault at all," he assured her. "And 
you are not a clumsy creature. I am more to blame for 
placing the bucket of water where I did." 

"I will draw you another bucketful of water," she said, 
beginning to coil the rope. 

"I will draw the water myself," he said. "I am much 
stronger than you." 

"No, you must let me do it." 

But when he caught hold of the bucket and stretched 
forth a brawny arm for the coil of rope in her hands, she 
surrendered both to him quickly and drew back a step as 
though shy of his touch. He lowered the bucket with his 
back to her. She had time to take in his tall figure, the 
breadth of his shoulders, and the sinewy length of his legs. 
Down below in the small of his back, two parallel ridges of 
rope-like muscle stuck out against the wet shirt. As he 
hauled up the bucket, muscles rippled all over his body.

Philippine Day at the Chicago "Century 

of Progress Exposition" 



By R. B. Blackman 



T T THEN our Philippine Legislature failed to make an 
1/1/ appropriation for Philippine participation in the 
^ ^ greatest exposition yet held in America, the Philip- 
pine Tourist Association bravely stepped into the gap, to 
do what it could with the limited means at its disposal. 
The Filipino flag floats at Chicago, 
thanks to the initiative of our private 
citizens. 

First, an introduction to Chicago 
and the great exposition, for the latter 
is a setting in the second greatest 
city of the United States, and takes 
much of its character from its ab- 
sorption of the spirit that domi- 
nates this progressive metropolis of 
the Lakes, Queen of the Middle 
West. 

Chicago 

Chicago one hundred years ago, 
1833, was a group of huts clustering 
around log-built Fort Dearborn, its 
feet in Lake Michigan mud, in a 
constant fear of Indian attacks. 

Swept almost clean, in 1871, by 
a consuming fire after thirty-eight 
years of rapid growth, the 100,000 
homeless people set about building 
a modern city, which was yet hardly 
completed when the Columbian Ex- 
position in 1893 was held, comme- 
morative of the landing of Colum- 
bus in America. 

Today, one hundred years after 
its founding, Chicago looks north- 
ward over the Lake and southward 
and westward over the whole Mis- 
sissippi valley, center of thirty-three 
railroad trunk lines, a train entering 
on an average of every fifty-eight 

seconds, year in and out. Its six thousand miles of 
streets and eighty -four of boulevards are lined by towering 
buildings and beautiful homes, around it lie hundreds of 
stock yards, packing houses, factories, ten thousand in- 
dustries, commercial giants of manufacture and distri- 
bution. The population of 4,000,000, growing at a rate 
of 70,000 a year, finds not only ample place to live, but has 
nearly 2,500 hectares of public parks and over 14,000 hec- 
tares of picnic and playgrounds for free use in and just 
around the city. No more are Chicago's feet in the mud, 
for enough mud has been pumped out the lake and marshes 
to raise the city fourteen feet above high water level. Some 
40,000,000 people live within a night ride — a population 
greater than that of Great Britain and France, equal to 
that of Germany. 




Court of Honor, Hall of Science 



Chicago has six famous libraries, an Art Institute, the 
Great Field Museum, the Shedd Aquarium, a twenty million 
dollar home of grand opera, a great Symphony Orchestra, a 
Museum of Science and Industry, the wonderful and only 
Adler Planetarium, three hundred grade schools, forty 
high schools, and colleges and univer- 
sities that enroll 40,000 students. 

The Exposition 
Having planned its one-hundredth 
birthday celebration before the crash 
of 1929, Chicago was checked by the 
depression, but not dismayed. The 
city determined to carry on in spite 
of all obstacles, and the Exposition 
is the achievement of all its dreams. 
Under the leadership of Rufus C. 
Dawes, seconded by committees of 
the ablest men of America, it was 
a steady march toward the goal, the 
best and greatest peoples* exposition 
ever held in the world. For this is 
truly an Exposition of Science and 
Industry, not in the spirit of pride, 
but of instruction, not for advertise- 
ment, but for education. Exhibitors 
were asked to show processes and 
methods of manufacture rather than 
finished products, to show the old 
beside the new, the crude beside the 
improved and perfected. In almost 
every section, this has been carried 
out. The Exposition is historical as 
well as educational in all lines of 
modern activity. It is the greatest 
and most fascinating school ever set 
up for the average citizen. He not 
only sees, but hears everywhere, 
careful explanations of everything, 
and in many cases is allowed and asked to participate in the 
carrying out of the experiments. Those who never studied 
science can here go to school and get a very good idea of 
what "it is all about." They see how their common house- 
hold conveniences are actually made, they see their automo- 
biles built and assembled, painted, motored, tuned up, and 
inspected, and run off the floor imder their own power. 

In short, they see Science and Applied Science in the arts 
and industries through the eyes of the engineer, the expert. 
They go into the laboratories with him, and into the shops 
and factories. Science and Industry have laid their cards 
on the table here in Chicago, as they are now doing in 
Washington. This friendliness, frankness, and straight- 
forward confidence will win them millions of friends in the 
Century of Progress Exposition. It is a striking illustration 

185

of the American method of securing the goodwill of the con- 
sumer — the public. 

A noticeable feature is the ample space allowed for streets 
and parks within the Exhibition grounds. There are also 
plenty of seats, rest rooms, and toilets. Tired people can 
always find a place to sit down and rest. Food and drinks 
are plentiful and cheap. The evident intention of the 
management was to make every possible provision for 
comfort and convenience. Our own Philippine Carnival 
authorities , could learn a lesson here. 

The Site Created for the Exposition 

When the question of a suitable site was considered, it 
was seen that to find the necessary extension of land, in a 
place available to the people, was an impossibility. It did 
not exist. It had to be created. But where? Of course, 
the Lake Front. There was Jackdon Park, but it was much 
too small. So the park was extended into the lake, and a 
large island added, all the necessary filling pumped up from 
the bottom of the lake, "great stone breakwaters built, all 
the new land laid out in parks, streets, boulevards, car- 
^ parking lots, with bridges over the lagoons, water, gas, and 
electric services installed — all in preparation for the build- 
ings of the Exposition. 

Then came the erection of the most strikingly modern 
and beautiful ar- 
chitectural crea- 
tions than have 
yet been seen by 
man. They are 
like nothing ever 
before erected. Pic- 
tures can only give 
a faint idea 9f their 
forms. Almost all 
are windowless — 
with artificial light- 
ing and air-condi- 
tioned ventilation. 
All are of strong 
material, steel prin- 
cipally, yet so built 
that they can easily 
be taken down and

their materials sold. Other expositions have been classic 
in architecture, but the Century of Progress Exposition is 
not only modem but highly futuristic in its trends. It 
shows what will probably be our building styles and meth- 
ods during the coming decades. 

If one can lose oneself in admiration of the great piles of 
tower, fagade, and wings in all their striking colors by day, 
the scene by night finds no words to describe it. The key- 
note is Light — the new light of the glass tube, air-with- 
drawn, gas-filled, glowing in all its strange forms, in fluted 
columns that climb into the night sky, in strange peaks 
and puzzling outlines. Buildings known by day are, when 
the lights come on after the long northern twilight, con- 
verted into new and unfamiliar shapes. One loses his sense 
of location, seeming to have been suddenly transported 
into another and stranger dream city. 

The Philippine Exhibit 
In the most modernistic of all the buildings, the great 
Hall of Transportation, with its floating dome, in a central 
location on the second floor, where 100,000 people pass it 
daily, the Tourist Association has set up its Philippine 
booth — not large, not well stocked with the varied products 
of the Philippines, long on articles from the non-Christian 
peoples, short or wholly devoid of representative manu- 
factures and art work, needle and weaving, pottery and 
carving; yet, in view of the failure of our Philippine Legisla- 
ture to provide an appropriation, a great deal better than 
nothing. The Tourist Association and Mr. James King 
Steele deserves our thanks and congratulations. People 
who have had their first contact with things Philippine 
and the Filipinos may not carry away an accurate, complete, 
balanced impression of our peoples and activities and re- 
sources, but after all what does it matter? There is so 
much to be seen, there are so many exhibits that so tower 
over and attract the interest and leave so much deeper 

impressions that, 
had we over ten 
times as much in 
our Philippine ex- 
hibit, it would still 
be insignificant 
compared to others 
around it. It is 
indeed a small 
spot in the huge 
Travel and Trans- 
portation Build- 
ing, which is itself 
only one of the 
hundreds of great 
units and groups 
of buildings that 



cover the 172 hectares of this 12,000,000 
dollar Exposition, yet there it is, holding 
its place, drawing the interest of the throngs 
that pass daily before it. 

Philippine Day 

Saturday, August 5, is the Philippine 
Day, as the many bulletin boards around 
the grounds announce. Others too, have 
their **days", with parades and speeches, 
noise and fun. Ours is modest, and some 
of it not for the public. 

We start the day, at 10:30 a. m., with a 
radio conversation between our Governor - 
General, Hon. Frank Murphy, in Manila, 
and President Dawes and other officials of the Expo- 
sition. This should have been broadcasted in the Ex- 
position, but it was not — the reasons for which we do not 
know. From the United States end went short speeches 
by President Dawes and other officials, including Mr. Steele. 

At 1 :00 p. m. a luncheon was given to Exposition officials 
by the Philippine Tourist Association in one of the Chicago 
hotels at which liquid refreshments and somewhat dry and 
perfunctory speeches were the usual order. 

This was followed by a parade of the party to the grounds, 
with police escort, met at the gates by a guard of honor, 
courtesy of the Exposition. 

At 3 :00 p.m. in the spacious court of honor of the Trans- 
portation Building where a platform had been erected and 
chairs placed, a program was rendered for all who cared to 
stop and sit an hour under the burning sun of a Chicago 
afternoon. Many took the opportunity offered by a free 
show, as Exposition crowds always do, yet not all the chairs 
were occupied, nor could all suffer the baking of a full stay. 

After a few introductory words by 'Mr. Steele, the Fili- 
pino anthem was sung by a chorus of forty Filipino men and 
women, accompanied by two string orchestras. This was 
followed by a response by President Dawes of the Exposi- 
tion, who sat on the platform, an interested spectator, 
during the entire program. 

Followed the unfurling of the Filipino flag on a mast by 
the platform, the rope 
pulled by President 
Dawes that allowed the 
flag to take its place on 
the left of the American 
flag that already floated 
in the lake breeze. 

After an orchestra 
number, well applauded, 
Toastmaster Steele cal- 
led on some American

friends of the Philippines who were in the 
audience, to step to the platform and before 
the microphone and make such remarks 
as the time and place inspired in them. 
Among theoe were Burton Holmes, famed 
traveler and writer of books on travel and 
gatherer of pictures from all over the world, 
whose first trip to the Philippines was in 
1899, when, with great difficulty and in 
some danger, he went as far north as San 
Fernando, Pampanga. Another speaker 
was Floyd Gibbons, well known by many 
residents in our Islands. 

Among the other numbers presented, all 
well received, were the following: 




Filipino String Band 



Dancc~"La Cariflosa" Miss Francisca Dacanay 

Mrs. Basalco and Partners 

Filipino Folk Songs Mr. Roman Crispo 

Filipino Dance— "La Surtido". Miss Ronquillo, Miss Mangabin

Mr. Arturo Beltran 

Dance— Fandango Miss Rosario Regalato and Partner 

Filipino Folk Song Mr. Crispulo Pasqual 

Moro Dance Miss Magdalena Calloway 

Chorus of all voices "Mabuhay** 

An extra on the program was an exhibition of yo-yo 
spinning by two very capable Filipino boys who exhibited 
all the known Island forms, with some American and Chi- 
cago tricks added. 

The dancing was, of course, as good as could be expected 
from those who could be found in Chicago, for there were 
no funds to bring our best dancers from the Islands. Mr. 
Gibbons, commenting on the grace and rythm of our dances, 
remarked that he was in favor of importing them to replace 
the rather graceless and unpleasing forms at present so 
popular in America. 

All the Filipino girls presented were in appropriate dress, 
either the classic mestiza or the Balintawak, although the 

style and materials used 
would be considered 
rather common and not 
quite modern in Manila. 
It is not to be expected 
that Filipinos so far 
from their homeland 
could keep up to the last 
minute in the cut and 
hang of these rather in-

Necromancy In The Barrio 

By Maximo Ramos 



ARE you after a gpirl who, no matter what ff^ 

the position of the moon is when you go pi^ 

to her house, immediately vanishes into an ||^ 

inner room and does not come out again until after SM 

you have left? That is but one of the many diffi- HI 
culties about which you may go to the barrio 
necromancer. If you ask his help in this case, for instance, 
he will advise you as follows: 

The Conquering Cigarette 
Ask one who trades with the Negritos to procure for you 
a calumbay lo-o. This is a plant that grows on slippery 
mountain ridges, and is difficult to obtain otherwise. The 
leaves of this mountain plant are like a whorl of fluffy cat- 
tails growing profusely from a heart shaped base. You 
bring the plant to the necromancer, who will select for 
you the tip of one of the leaves. You dry this tip over a 
stove, and after three days, cut it into tiny bits and roll 
them into a cigarette. Then you are ready for the conquest. 

It is not often that the girl goes alone to the river to fill 
her earthisn jar with drinking water, but if you wait patient- 
ly, the chance will come. The best thing for you to do is to 
hide yourself near the footpath away from the houses. 
The girl must be alone, unless you want to marry two girls 
at one and the same time, which is not done nowadays. 
The moment you see her hurrying down the path (a sure 
sign that she is alone), light the **cigarette", inhale a lungfull 
of the smoke, and jump out at her. She will be frightened 
and will start to run home. But don't lose courage. Keep 
beside her and puff the smoke in her face. The first puff 
will not produce any observable effect; she will keep on 
running like a scared mouse. But at the second, she will 
slacken her pace. At the third puff, she will drop her jar 
and fling herself into your arms. And at the fourth, she 
will make you promise to bring your parents to her house at 
once to make the arrangements with her parents as to the 
pigs and chickens to be killed before the full moon wanes. 
But be sure not to administer more than four puffs or else 
she will never, even for a moment, leave your arms, and 
you will realize in the end that no life can be more miserable 
than that of a man with such a wife. 

Black Magic with the Hair-and-Egg 
Although the barrio necromancer is not so generous to 
girls with a similar problem, he is always willing to help 
them protect themselves from evil. He tells them, for 
instance, never to neglect their hair, especially the hair 
that grows at the top of the head. For if a man with evil 
designs, or his agents, can steal one such whole hair, he 
can make the girl crazy by doing either of two things, 
both simple. He can get a needle whose eye is broken, and 
with the notch insert the hair into a newly laid egg. That 
done, he has but to subject the egg to a little boiling to 
cause the owner of the hair to lose her reason and begin 
screaming things no woman should ever be permitted to 
scream. 

188 



Sorcery with the Water Bug 
The other way to work harm with the stolen hair 
^^Jj is to tie it around the body of a water strider and set 
the bug free on the water. The moment the insect 
starts to dart across the water, the owner of the 
hair will leap into the street and commence crying 
out unwomanly things. The harm done is more than that 
produced by the needle-and-egg procedure, because the vic- 
tim can never be cured. When the water bug has been 
loosed on the water, it can never be found again, nor the 
hair around its body. In the case of the hair-in-the-egg, 
however, when the egg breaks, the victim's sanity returns. 

Bedeviling a Thief 
It is not young people's problems alone that the witch 
doctor of the barrio is interested in, however. In fact he 
has a remedy for almost anything that needs to be remedied. 
If a thief has stolen your chickens or the rice under your 
house, for example, and you want to inflict some real 
punishment on the thief, here is the procedure the necro- 
mancer suggests to you: 

With a coconut shell, pick up the thief's footprint, pour 
the earth into an old pot, and heat it over the fire. Then 
get a bamboo tube, pour the scorched earth into it, and stop 
it up with black cloth. As long as the earth is hot, the 
thief will have a burning fever; and you can heat it again 
after it has cooled off, if you want to punish the thief fur- 
ther. 

How to See the Spirits 
The necromancer knows of a good many ways by which 
a man may acquire the power to do supernatural things. 
Perhaps the simplest of these ways is that by which one 
may enable himself to see the spirits that sail through the 
air on windy nights. . When at night the dogs sit under a 
tree and howl, you may be sure that they are seeing spirits. 
You just have to steal among the dogs, rub your eyes 
against those of one of them, crouch on all fours, and look 
up. You will see everything that the dogs are howling at. 

Charms to Acquire Invisibility 
By doing either of two things, you may even acquire in- 
visibility. One way is to acquire possession of the bones of 
the nighthawk. This bird is very difficult to see on its 
nest on the bare sands, but if you can kill the bird with a 
stone at night, bury it on the spot where it falls. Then, 
after the seventh week, go and dig up the bones, wash them 
with river sand, and place them in your pocket. As long 
as the bones are in your pocket, no one can see you; you 
can not even see yourself. 

The other way to acquire the power of invisibility, 
according to the medicine-man of the barrio, is much more 
seldomly practiced. It is believed by the barrio folk that no 
one has ever seen the cattle-egret's egg because it is in- 



visible, and that he who has with him the egg of this bird 
will possess the same strange iMx>perty. The only way a 
man can get this egg is by looking at the reflection of the 
bird's nest on the water while feeling for it among the 
branches of the overhanging tree in which the nest rests. 

The Magic Banana Stone" for Strength 

To acquire strength and courage, one must swallow and 
keep in one's mouth for one night the **stone'' of a banana 
flower that faces east. By the way, every kind of plant is 
believed to possess a **stone**, a certain mysterious object 
that the otherworld inhabitants of the plant play with. 
The **stone** of each kind of plant varies in kind and in 
properties from the **stones** of all other plants. The 
"stone*' of the banana is a magic object the size of a man's 
big toe, which glows like a live coal. During still evenings 
it flits wildly among the banana tops, but when there hap- 
pens to be a bud turned toward the east (an extremely rare 
occurrence), this **stone** remains with the flower for a 
number of nights, flitting around the banana heart. 

To obtain this magic object, one must erect a bamboo 
platform under the banana flower, and at moonrise climb 
up the scaffold, catch the banana **stone**, and swallow it. 
Instantly the huge, black guardians of the banana **stone'* 
will appear and try to wrest their plaything away from the 
intruder. As these guardians are capable of walking the 
air, the battle-ground will be not only the scaffold but also 
the air, up to the level of the banana tops. If the man lets 
the *'stone** out of his mouth, he becomes crazy; but if 
until daylight he succeeds in keeping the prize, the un- 
earthly beings will vanish, and he will become the strongest 
man in all the villages around. 

The Black Pebble at the Heart of the Whirlwind 

But mere strength and courage is nothing compared to 
the power of walking through the air, which, according to 
the barrio necromancer, is an ability that may be acquired. 
If a strong whirlwind comes your way, throw your hat into 
the center of the whirlpool. If, after the wind subsides, 
the hat has not been overturned, go and feel underneath 



the hat without lifting it from the ground. You will find 
a black pebble, the possession of which enable yoML 
walk in the air. I leave it to you to imi^Euie what thhiii 
you might do being able to walk in the air and by possessing 

invisibility. 

How to Bring a Tardy Husband Home 

If you are a wife, there are times when your husband 
foes away and fails to return at the promised time. You 
have but to tie his old shirt around a post and give it a 
good beating, and soon he comes running home, panting. 

Charm to Cure a Lazy Husband 

Or perhaps he is a man who gets up in the morning only 
when he hears the rattle of the coconut-shell dishes in the 
kitchen. For him the witch-doctor offers you an excellent 
cure. About sunset on Good Friday go to a banana grove 
and look for a shoot whose tip has just broken out of the 
ground. Stand still beside it, and when the rim of the 
descending sun is as thin as a blade of grass, stoop down, 
bare your teeth, and bite off the tip of the shoot. When 
that is done, hurry back home, cut the sucker into tiny 
bits, cook it with rice, and feed it to your husband. After 
that, the sun will never see him in bed again. 

The Seed that Drives Away Evil Spirits 
Or do you have little children? You should know that 
evil spirits are always around, ready to work harm whenever 
they are in the humor — unless they are prevented by us. By 
all means, if you want that nothing harmful will befall 
your children, procure some saddiat beads and tie them 
around their necks and wrists. These beads are made of 
small brown seeds obtainable from any Negrito trader. 
Saddiat beads protect their wearer from evil spirits. If 
the spirits haunt your house, you can easily drive them away 
by burning three or four of the seeds with the same number 
of chicken's feathers on coals placed on a pot -lid. From 
that time on, until a new child is born, your house will be 
free from spirits with evil designs. And may your tribe 
increase! 



Grief 

By Abelardo Subido 
Y^U promised to be true, yet in the night 

When Death, the ardent lover, called to you 
Out of the shadows fringed with misty light. 
You followed him. O Love, you are untrue! 
I can not reach you with my voiceless call, 
I can not find the darksome haunts of Death. 
Within my room I gaze upon the wall. 
Resigned unto my fate. ... I feel the breath 
Of unseen powers against my pallid face. 
I hear a nightbird call out of its nest 
That makes me think of coming cheerless days . . . 
I press the thought of you close to my breast. 
God! give me strength to bear this crushing grief; 
You taught me that our worldly joys are brief. 



Conquered 

By Celestino M. Ve&a 
j^^Y thoughts are strong desires 
Winging their way to God! 
But each time I behold young bambooa 
Reaching upward, seeking His throne, 
Only to bend their heads to earth at last, 
I, too, conquered, am silent. 



Nunc Dimittus 

By Aurelio Alvero 
^NOTHER day is over, J^d, 

I give it now to The4t 
And let it be a golden bdid 
On my Life's rosary. 



O'Keefe— Last of the North Pacific Pirates 

By H. V. Gostenoble 



THIS atory, by a former German resident of the 
Pacific islands, recounts how the Germans broke 
the power and ended the known career of O'Keefe, 
the last of the long line of Caucasian sea rovers — raid- 
ers, smugglers, and slavers — who established themselves 
on wild islands, married chiefs' daughters, and ruled 
as kings. The fact that they did not fly the black flag 
does not signify that they were not pirates. O'Keefe used what- 
ever flag suited his purpose of the moment. His headquarters 
toward the end of his career was the island of Yap in the Caro- 
lines, probably selected by him because its people considered 
themselves the rulers of all the islands of the group, and, in fact, 
received tribute from many of them. Yap was also the nearest 
primitive island to Hongkong. O'Keefe was never held to the 
law before the coming of the Germans as he often assisted the 
various governments in control of the south sea islands when 
this did not interfere with business. In August of 1894, for 
inatance, he captured a Pelew chieftain, the leader of a band 
which had captured the trading schooner, the Maria II, and 
massacred the whole crew. The chief had long defied Spanish 
authority. O'Keefe held him up single-handed in the presence 
of his own warriors and turned him over to the authorities. 
This and many other tales of daring are told of him. It was 
men like him whom writers like Conrad and Stevensmn had in 
iAitid in their sea-rover stories of the south seas. 




THE German consul for Sidney was walking silently 
up and down the sala in the Government House at 
Yap, the capital of the West Carolines. Finally he 
entered the office of the Bezirksamtmann Senfift. 

*'My dear Amtmann," he said, **I have come to the con- 
clusion that something has to be done. Much as I enjoy 
your hospitality and this beautiful islr.nd, I can not stay 
here forever; nor can I leave my Home Office without 
information as to our disaster and the reason for my delay 
here. It is my plain duty to do something!'* 

'*Very well, Herr Consul, then be kind enough to tell me 
what you intend to do. The Lloyd steamer is on that 
uncharted rock; you know it is impossible for us to get her 
off. There is no cable connection with the mainland — only 
the plan to lay a cable to Shanghai. . . . Do you wish to 
risk a voyage to Hongkong in a native boat — even at this 
time of the year? *' 

"No, no, certainly not! But yonder lies the schooner 
of that man O'Keefe. Why not sail her to Honkong?" 

"Easier said than done, Herr Consul. We have no 
navigator. The captain and officers of the stranded 
steamer are not permitted to leave their ship as it is in a 
dangerous position. O'Keefe himself, as you know, is a 
prisoner — accused of frustrated homicide. " 

"I know, I know, but good Lord! I can't remain here 
another two months until the next Lloyd boat arrives. Is 
there no way out? *' 

"No way I can see", said the Amtmsmn. 

JN the late afternoon, the Consul, the Bezirksamtmann, his 
assistant, the Lazaretgehilfe (army nurse), the Cap- 
tain of the stranded steamer, and some of the other officers 
of the ship were sitting about the round table in the back 
room of Friedlander's Bierstube. Friedlander was a 



German Jew who had come to Yap during the first 
weeks of the German occupation with the inten- 
tion of trading in the main product of the island, 
copra. But O'Keefe, the "King of Yap", had most 
of the native chiefs under his thumb and got prac- 
tically all of the copra himself. So Friedlander 
had become the sole importer of German beer and canned 
goods. Every late afternoon the Germans living near 
and such visitors as might be on the island gathered at 
the drinking room Friedlander had opened in his house 
to drink their Dammerschoppen (evening glass) and 
to talk over the news of the day — if any. 

Friedlander, a large and somewhat paunchy man, was 
himself a member of the "round table", from which he but 
directed the Yap boy to bring in fresh bottles of beer. 

"You came here, Herr Friedlander, when the Spanish 
friars were still on the island?" asked the Consul, his glance 
fixed on the large O'Keefe home visible from the window of 
the Bierstube. 

"Yes, indeed, Herr Consul." 

"These friars are generally well versed in the history of 
the place in which they work. Did they ever tell you 
anything about this O'Keefe? Where he came from, for 
instance? " 

"Well, they were somewhat vague as to that. They 
didn't even know whether he was an American or an Eng- 
lishman." 

"He is an American, according to his papers," interjected 
the Amtmann. 

"I was told," continued Friedlander, "that O'Keefe 
used for several years to come to Yap for long rests, but 
that he did not settle down here until he married. 

"One day he came into the harbor with the English flag 
at his mast, but when he saw an English warship was at 
anchor here he hauled the flag down and up went the stars 
and stripes. Somebody on the English ship observed 
this maneuver and an officer was sent aboard the schooner 
to inquire what it meant. O'Keefe excused himself by 
stating that the native sailor who had hoisted the flags did 
not know the diff'erence between the one and the other and 
that he himself had paid no immediate attention to the 
matter as he was busy piloting the schooner through the 
narrow channel. 

"According to the friars, the schooner always carried 
two guns. When Yap became German he dismounted 
them and placed them as ornaments in front of his house, 
where you see them now." 

"That is interesting. But how did it come about that 
he gained such an influence over the people? Aren't the 
Yap islanders rather a proud people?" 

"They certainly are, but he married a native girl, you see, 
the daughter of the leading chief. Besides, the people 
are afraid of him. He is easily angered and uses his fists 
or a stick or whatever he may have to hand, as you can 
see from the case of Yao." 



"How is Yao today, Hcrr Witschok?" asked the Amt- 
mann of the Army Nurse. 

"Well, he is a strong fellow, tod appears to be getting 
better from day to day. His wounds are clean now — no 
more infection.'* 

"What made O'Keefe hit him with that bolo?'* asked the 
Consul. 

"Nothing much. O'Keefe had ordered him to get down 
coconuts that day, and when O'Keefe got back that evening 
he found that Yao had gathered less than half of what he 
could have done. Then he grinned when O'Keefe got 
angry and that made O'Keefe grab the bolo the native 
had in his hand and knock him in the head with it. Yao 
dodged but most of his left ear was slashed off and he got a 
deep cut in the shoulder." 

"You see, Herr Consul," said the Amtmann, "how 
impossible it is to let O'Keefe sail away under these cir- 
cumstances. We do not even know whether his crime will 
be schwere Koerperverletzung (frustrated homicide) or 
Todschlag (homicide), depending upx)n whether Yao 
recovers." 

"You are entirely right. Nevertheless it is of the utmost 
importance to me as well as to the Captain that the home 
authorities be notified " 

"Why not let O'Keefe put up bail?" asked the Captain. 

"My dear Captain, we do not make use of that system. 
If a man is suspected of intending to flee or is seeking to 
confuse the evidence, he is locked up; otherwise he remains 
free until the courts decide his case." 

"If O'Keefe is such a troublesome citizen, would it not 
be a good idea to let him escape?" 

"Ah, Herr Amtmann, the idea is excellent!" exclaimed 
the Consul. "Let him give bail, say twenty thousand 



marks, carry our message to Honkong, and then» if he does 
not return to Yap, you may thank God for it! Betides, by 
such a course, you will be following the instructions of the 
Colonial Office to protect the natives from exploitation by 
foreigners and to help them along economically. O'Keefe's 
monopoly of the copra trade here is certainly against the 
interests of the people. . . 

"Also think of it. Even if the case prove only one of 
frustrated homicide, you will have to give him a stiff sen- 
tence at least several years of imprisonment. But 

you have no prison— only that little one-room jail for native 
prisoners. You could hardly keep a man there for several 
years. ..." 

Bezirksamtmann finally agreed to the proposal, 
and three days later O'Keefe sailed away on his own 
schooner carrying the Government message to Hongkong. 
Several weeks passed by, but no schooner returned to Yap. 
However, after four weeks a small German cruiser arrived 
on a regular yearly round trip through the German Pacific 
possessions. Her captain did not know anything about 
the occurences at Yap. The Consul sailed away on the 
cruiser and the German Government and the North Ger- 
man Lloyd were notified of what had happened. 

O'Keefe never delivered the message he was entrusted 
with. He did not show up at Hongkong and was never 
heard of again. Somebody once claimed to have seen a 
member of his crew in Honolulu, but this remained doubtful. 

When some years later he was declared legally dead, 
his Yap wife inherited his property on that island. Another 
wife from the island of Mogomog presented herself, but 
the Amtmann decided that her marriage was void as it 
had taken place subsequent to the Yap marriage. He how- 
ever, let her have O'Keefe's property on Mogomog island. 



Song Of A Blind Man 

By Carlos P. San Juan 

jyi^Y life is one long night 

Of conscious sleep. No mom 
Awakes me from my dreams; 
My world is dark and yet 
All wondrous things live here: 
I hear the lovely songs 
Of unseen birds and the flutter of 
Their silken, fair-plumed wings, 
I breathe the perfume of 
Ghost flow'rs that bloom 
In phantom gardens fair . . . 
Why should I pine for light? 
This world is mine alone — 
'Tis peopled with my dreams 
And here I am the king! 



I Told The Sky 

By Aurelio Alvero 

J told the sky 
I love you; 
So far, so high— 

The moon and stars above you 
Have heard my sigh. 

I told the sea 

I love you, 
Despairingly — 

The trembling lights sing of you 
But pity me. 

To sky and sea, 

I love you: 
So, silently — 

The lights below, above you 
Now plead for me.

Pinipig 

By F. T. Adriano and R. A. Cruz 



PNIPIG or duman (Tagalog), pinipgi 
(Bicol), pilipii (Visayan) is a delicious rice I J 
preparation made from certain glutinous ■Uj 
varieties of the grain known popularly as mala^^it, ■ W 
Pinipig may be eaten raw or as an ingredient in ^Ll 
cakes, puddings, and in other kinds of desserts. 
Puffed or roasted, it makes a fine breakfast food. 
Speaking of bre^fast foods, the Philippines imported in 
1931 some P135,000 worth of oatmeal alone. In this case, 
again, a wise economy points to the development of our 
own food resources. 

Although pinipig at present can be bought in the local 
market only at certain times of the year, (except at Bifian, 
Laguna) and ordinarily can not be kept for more than a 
few days without becoming stale or moldy, it could be 
properly prepared and put up in sanitary tin vacuum cans, 
as is oatmeal. 

In the preparation of pinipig both the immature rice 
grains, in the ''dough'' stage, and the mature grains are 
used. Pinipig prepared from the former is softer in texture, 
more aromatic, and commands the higher price. When 
the mature rice grains are used, as at Biiian, there must be 
a preliminary overnight soaking in water before the grain 
can be roasted. It is usually prepared by the people only 
at the approach of the rice' harvest season. 

The method followed at Biiian is the following: The 
palay or matured rice is soaked in water overnight. It is 
then drained and placed in large earthen pots known as 
katingan. These are placed on specially constructed 
earthen-ware stoves similar to those used in the preparation 
of moscovado sugar. During the roasting, the grain is 
constantly stirred with a wooden paddle. The quality of 
the product is usually determined by the thoroughness and 
uniformity of the roasting, which is continued until some 
of the grains begin to puff. The grain is then immediately 
poured into a wooden mortar (lusong) and pounded with 
a wooden pestle (halo). The pounding is done by expe- 
rienced men workers and while it is going on a woman as- 
sistant constantly stirs the grain with her hands, for if this 
is not done, the grains are likely to stick together. The 
pounding separates the grains from the hulls, the former 
being reduced to flakes and the latter to a fine powder. 
The flattened grains are later separated from the powdered 
hulls by means of a fine-meshed bamboo sieve {bistay or 
bit hay) and by winnowing. Some eighteen gantas of 
pinipig are ordinarily obtained from one cavan of palay. 
The pinipig ^elh at from twenty-five to thirty centavos a 
ganta. The bran is sold as hog feed. 

Samples of pinipig prepared from different varieties of 
glutinous rice were collected and their proximate consti- 
tuents determined by the senior author by methods em- 
ployed by him in previous studies on the chemical com- 
position of Philippine foods and feedstuffs. Table I gives 
the results of analyses based on the samples, as received, 

w 



but since the moisture content of the samples 
varied, the recalculations on a moisture free basis 
shown in Table II were made. It will be seen that 
the different food constituents vary greatly in the 
different samples analysed.

sports in the Philippine Islands 

By Henry Dougherty 



COLONEL H. R. ANDREAS was studying a 
cablegram when we called upon him a few 
months ago at the Olympic Stadium. He 
shoved the message aside and transferred his at- 
tention to a statement of Stadium box office returns. 
Next he inspected a roster of boxers, all of whom 
were seeking bouts in Manila. Not a single top-notcher 
was on the list. He shook his head and again picked up 
the cablegram. 

Wrestling Didn't "Click'' 

**Wrestling, American style,** he mused. **Why not? It 
is popular in America. It is popular in Europe and Aus- 
tralia. Why shouldn*t it be popular in Manila?** 

Colonel Andreas talked a few minutes with Les Hartman, 
Stadium matchmaker, and then a message was dispatched 
to Australia. Another was sent to Los Angeles. With 
the president of the Manila Boxing club action comes 
closely on the heels of decision. Those two. cablegrams 
would bring some mat grapplers to the Philippine Islands. 

A month later we were again in the Stadium offices. 
Colonel Andreas had come in from San Fernando, and today 
he was smiling broadly. 

**I have a surprise for you,** he said. Les Hartman as- 
sumed a mysterious air, and even Ramon Ramos, the 
Stadium treasurer, unbended and smiled. 

We heard footfalls outside— heavy footfalls. We heard 
strange voices, a mixture of Australian, Greek, American, 
Canadian, and a conglomeration of accents. The swinging 
door to the office was thrown open and three athletic looking 
gentlemen peered in on us. 

"I have the pleasure of introducing Joe Keatos, Jerry 
Jervis, and Rocky Britton,*' said the Colonel. The three 
heavy-set athletes strode forward, and the writer of this 
article felt apprehensive. **They have come here to intro- 
duce a new form of sports to Manila fans.** 

And so it came to pass that these behemoths later enter- 
ed the ring, and the fans were regaled mightily. Keatos 
proved to be the best of the lot, and therefore became im- 
mediately unpopular with the cash customers. Wrestling, 
American style, rambled its merry way at the Stadium on 
successive Saturday nights, and attendance increased 
slightly. But the intake at the box office had not been 
enhanced sufficiently to encourage an indefinite experiment. 

Later on George Calvas, of Ireland, arrived. He became 
the most popular of the wrestlers, although Keatos, by 
virtue of his unpopularity, was the best card, a paradox not 
easily explained, but true, just the same. 

A few weeks ago Keatos, Jervis, and Britton folded their 
tents and stole away. Literally, they sailed for Australia. 
The great experiment had not been satisfactory. The 
wrestling game had had its trial in Manila, but it hadn*t 
clicked. That's too bad. In its modern form, wrestling 
is an amusing game, and it also has its thrills. 

Maybe in the years to come it will catch on here. And 
again, maybe not. The Filipino does not like the mat game, 
apparently. He would rather be a boxer. Just an illustra- 




tion. Manila can not be easily diverted from 
beaten paths. 

Boxing in the Doldrums 
J There was a time when boxing was a gold mine in 
Manila. That was in the days when champions 
and near champions flourished hereabouts, and when fine, 
up-standing fighters were brought from the United States 
for engagements with them. 

But the tide ebbed. The champions and near champions 
went to America, and for some unaccountable reason, a 
crop of successors has not been developed. Without cham- 
pions, without idols, without the flash and romance that 
goes with champions, the boxing game dives into the dol- 
drums. It has taken that dive in the Philippine Islands. 

Of course there has been a semblance of a depression here, 
but that condition can not be held fully responsible for the 
lack of attendance at the Stadium. 

The ring game has been plagued with unsavory decisions 
in recent months, and every time one of these is pulled, it 
is just another unfortunate link in the chain of circumstances 
now conspiring to kill boxing in the Philippine Islands. 
There are referees and referees. The best of them will gp 
awry occasionally, and no matter how carefully the 
promoters guard against an off decision, one will creep in 
now and then. 

There has been much discussion as to whether the round - 
by -round scoring system is preferable to decisions by 
judges or decisions by referees. The latter, however, 
remains in vogue in Manila. 

Just a word about Manila fans. They make it extre- 
mely difficult for an invader to get a square deal. For the 
visitor to gain a decision, or even a draw, it is almost neces- 
sary for him to knock his opponent into insensibility. This 
has been glaringly apparent in the case of Ventura Marquez, 
the visiting Mexican. 

Loyalty is one thing, but bitter partisanship is another. 
The hometown crowd is expected to root for its hometown 
performers, but any crowd, any audience is expected also 
to recognize ability in the visitor, and good sportsmanship 
dictates that such ability should be recognized and ap- 
plauded. Instead, however, a certain type of Manila fan 
is inclined to hoot and boo an invader if he shows class and 
a winning punch. 

Basketball vs. Football 

have watched the crowds flocking to the various 
sports events. Next to boxing comes basketball in 
popularity. As the climate militates against American 
football, this strenuous pastime probably will never gain a 
foothold here. Basketball, less strenuous, is a similar 
game. Basketball, therefore, is the college sport of the 
Philippines.

Editorials 



The Philippine Education Co., Inc., hereby announces 
that the present, October, issue of the Philippine 

Magazine is the last that will appear 
Publishers' under its imprint, the Magazine having 
Announcement been sold to Mr. A. V. H. Hartendorp, 

who has edited the publication since 
June, 1925. It is under his editorship that the Magazine 
has assumed its present highly creditable character, and 
we wish him and the Magazine continued success. 

Verne £. Miller, 
President and General Manager. 



In having acquired the proprietorship of the Philippine 
Magazine, the imdersigned is impressed by the new re- 
sponsibilities he has thus assumed in addition 
Editor's to those which have hitherto rested upon 
Statement him. It is no small matter to undertake to 
carry forward a publication that is now in 
its thirty-first year — the oldest existing periodical in the 
Philippines, and one that has always played a creditable 
part in the journalism of this country. The undersigned 
plans no important changes in the editorial policy of the 
Magazine as this policy has during the period of his editor- 
ship been largely left to his own discretion by the Philippine 
Education Company, to which organization much of the 
credit should go for what the Magazine has become. The 
imdersigned will continue his endeavor to produce a maga- 
zine that is distinctively Philippine and will make every 
effort to maintain high standards of honesty in editorial 
policy and high standards of quality in the contents of 
the publication. 

A. V. H. Hartendorp. 



Expressing his disagreement with the 
decisions of the Court of First Instance 

and the Supre- 
**Castle and Fortress'' me Court, Gov- 
ernor-General 
Frank Murphy recently granted a pardon 
to a citizen convicted of "atentado contra la auto- 
ridad", on the ground that his fundamental legal rights 
had been violated. 

The Governor-General stated: **I am unable to view 
this episode in any other light than resistance to an im- 
lawful search of the respondent's domicile an unlaw- 
ful search of his home, in violation of the fundamental 
legal rights of the respondent guaranteed to him by the 
Bill of Rights and the Constitution, which the respondent 
had a legal right to resist*'. 

The Constitution of the United States regulates the 
right of search and seizure as follows (Article IV of the 
oripnal ten amendments): "The right of the people to 
be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, 

194 




against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be 
violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable 
cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly 
describing the place to be searched, and the persons or 
things to be seized*'. 

This great principle was not lost sight of by the Americans 
when they came to the Philippines. In his proclamation 
following the occupation of Manila, General Merritt stated 
that he had instructions from the United States Govern- 
ment not to make war upon the people, **but to protect 
them in their homes, in their employments, and in 
their personal and religious rights'*. President McKinley 
in his instructions to the Philippine Commission declared 
that **the right to be secure against unreasonable searches 
and seizures shall not be violated**. The Philippine Act of 
1902 contained this provision: **. . . that the right to be 
secure against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not 
be violated*'. The Jones Act repeats these exact words. 

Every man's home is his castle, is an old saying. And 
Sir Edward. Coke (1552-1634), the first to be called Lord 
Chief Justice of England, who was * 'obstinate in his opposi- 
tion to illegal exercise of authority. . . . and upheld the 
Common Law against the Church, the Admiralty, the Star 
Chamber, and, most dangerous of all, the royal prerogative, 
with success**, wrote these famous words: "The house of 
every one is to him as his castle and fortress, as well for 
his defense against injury and violence, as for his repose.'* 

Under the American flag, a nipa hut in the Philippines 
is in this sense a castle, too. An editorial writer in the 
Manila Tribune well said: "We may make out to our 
credit centuries of struggle for self-determination, but the 
background of our civil liberties is an adaptation from other 
lands. As Governor-General Murphy declares inviolate 
the house for the protection of every Filipino citizen, it is 
Anglo-Saxon individualism informing the law upon which 
that right rests that comes to mind. But our people 
accept it no less because of that alien origin. . . . ** 

As a matter of fact, the so-called Malolos Constitution, 
written by Felipe Calderon, an able Manila lawyer, con- 
tained several paragraphs on this very point, stating that 
no one should enter a house without the consent of the 
owner, except to assist him in an emergency, and that 
"the searching of his papers or effects can only be decreed 
by a competent judge and executed in the daytime. . . in 
the presence of the interested party or a member of his family, 
and, in their absence, of two witnesses residing in the same 
town. However, if an offender found in flagrante and 
pursued by the authorities or their agents should take 
refuge in his domicile, these may enter the same, but only 
for the purpose of his apprehension." 

In extending the pardon referred to in this editorial, the 
Governor-General did nothing more than to call public 
attention to an ancient right under civilized government, 
but such reminders are sometimes necessary, especially 
when even our courts overlook them.

The Moro-moro Performance 



By I. L. Miranda 



The pages of this Magazine have more frequently 
carried criticism than praise of former Speaker Manuel 

Roxas, but credit will not be denied 
The Moro-moro to him for the sincerity of the follow- 
Performance ing words: **It is not fair that the 

opponents of the Hawes-Cutting-Hare 
Act should declare that immediate independence is obtain- 
able, when they know very well that it is not, and that, 
if it were, it would be impracticable and suicidal for our 
country**. 

These words demand respect. Yet something is to be 
said for the politicians who have, however hypocritically, 
used this immediate independence argument against the 
Act. The issue of the acceptance or rejection of the Hawes 
Act has become a political one in a partisan sense, and, in 
fact, both sides are guilty of confusing the issue by misstate- 
ments of fact and appeals to emotion and prejudice. Per- 
haps this is unavoidable under the circumstances. Bismarck 
once said that **politics is the art of the possible'', and it 
seems to be generally agreed that the tautological imme- 
diate, absolute, and complete independence** slogan (the 
author of which, the writer believes, is the valiant Mr. 
Osias) can not possibly be eliminated from any political 



argument, least of all the present one. Also, our political 
leaders whose power, like that of politicians elsewhere, 
depends to a large degree upon the following they are able 
to obtain from a still principally ignorant electorate, must 
emotionalize and dramatize every issue to make an impres- 
sion on the people, or so, at least, they appear to believe. 
And what standard and ensign can be waved before the 
people with more instant effect than the banner of imme- 
diate independence? 

Thus it is that a political performance is being staged 
that reminds the observer of the Moro-moro shows in our 
villages, while the players as well as the audience appear 
to be oblivious to the grim realities which surround us. 
There, on the stage, are the champions, heroes, villains, 
the ingenue, and the walking gentleman, all strutting and 
fretting their hour upon the stage, while the audience hisses 
or applauds. Those watching the heroics on the platform 
appear to be unaware of the gathering storm. The spouting 
and the ranting, the mouthed platitudes, the tragicalities 
on the boards engage all the attention. The distant light- 
ning flashes, the low rumbling of the thunder, the brief, 
preliminary gusts of wind are unheeded. Who will ring 
the tocsin which will halt this mummery and awaken these 

195 



people to their peril? What alann signal will call these 
players down from the stage to engage in real action in the 
real world? a. v. h. h. 




One of the ablest and most sincere 
declarations made against the Hawes-Cut- 

ting-Hare Act 
An Able and Sincere was the Memorial 
Document drawn up by a 

committee of 
which Judge Juan Sumulong was the chairman, adopted at 
a special convention of the Philippine Veteran's Association 
on September 17* 

The Memorial contains no fanatical declaration in favor 
of "immediate, complete, and absolute independence'', 
but states that the Hawcs Act is ''destructive of our ideal 
of absolute political independence'' and is ''openly 
repugnant to the ultimate aim of the American policy to 
place our people ... in a position to fully assume the re- 
sponsibilities and enjoy all the privileges of complete inde- 
pendence'*. 

The Memorial does not object to the retention of naval 
and military bases in the Philippines— which would indeed 
be our only safeguard—but objects only to the retention of 
"unspecified portions of our national territory". Fur- 
ther on in the document it is suggested that America retain 
a naval base at *'an isolated point in the Islands". 

The authors of the Memorial, however, in an attempt 
to make matters doubly sure, also ask that the Govern- 
ment of the United States "take up, before the with- 
drawal of American sovereignty from these Islands, the 
conclusion of a treaty of neutralization of our country. . ." 

The rest of the document consists chiefly of a criticism 
of the one-sided nature of the economic provisions of the 
Hawes Act and of the humiliating conditions that would be 
established by its political provisions. 

In conclusion it is declared: *'Our Association desires 
to state that although it has not been possible for us to give 
our assent to the provisions of the Hawes-Cutting-Hare Law, 
yet our full faith in the devotion of the American people to 
the principles of liberty and justice remains unshaken. 
We hope that our objections and comments. . . will not 
fail to be heeded, and that the American people and Govern- 
ment in their wisdom and uprightness, will find a solution 
to the Philippine question more acceptable to our people". 

A. v. H. H. 



At this stage in our Philippine development it is well to 
review certain fundamental attitudes characterizing America 

in its dealing with the Philip- 
The Spirit of America pines. 

The record of a generation 
has fully convinced the Filipinos that the underlying Amer- 
ican policy in the Philippines has been and is to cooperate 
in the establishment of a self-governing nation. 

To that end have the efforts of America's highest rep- 
resentatives been directed. The early emphasis given 
to the political phase of our national progress was ac- 
companied by educational efforts designed to prepare the 
people for direct participation in their own government. 
Filipinization of the political structure was a hope held 
Out to the youths of the land. 

But as Filipinization of the government reached the 

196 



marginal point, it became apparent that this greater parti- 
cipation by Filipinos in their own government was not 
sufficient. There was need of increasing their part in the 
economic life of the nation. The Filipinization of our 
economic life became a phase of Philippine-American 
policy. 

The American chief executives of the last few years have 
given increasing attention to the economic development 
of the Philippines by and for Filipinos. They have en- 
deavored to preach economic -mindedness among our 
people, thus inducing us to modify old social values in the 
direction of greater appreciation of material progress and 
of the men who deal with material things. 

And now for the first time in our Philippine-American 
relations we have a Governor-General who issued a pro- 
clamation for a *'Made-in-the-Philippines Week", — from 
August 17 to August 23, 1933. "I hereby request", urged 
Governor Frank Murphy, "all the people of these Islands 
to observe it as a week in which products of the Philippines 
will be used by them for their home and personal needs. 
I hope this spirit of cultivating and encouraging home in- 
dustries will be maintained all the coming years so that it 
will mark the rise in this country of a vigorous and healthy 
spirit of economic progressiveness". 

This injunction to the Filipino people to use more of their 
home products — for "it is a natural trait among the peoples 
of all enlightened countries to love and to feel a special re- 
gard for the things that they consider their own", — breathes 
the spirit of America in her dealing with the Filipino 
people. With the guidance and the helping hand extended 
by the United States the Filipinos should not fail to attain 
the goal of their national ambition.

President Roosevelt is an internationalist — or was, as 
is sufficiently demonstrated by his efforts on behalf of 

world peace and the importance 
President Roosevelt's he gave to the discussions on 
Internationalism world economic problems with 

the heads of various govern- 
ments before the London Economic Conference. But at 
this conference he declined to sacrifice his domestic program, 
which was already achieving results, to what a number of 
other nations believed to be their interests, especially as 
concerned the stabilization of currencies and foreign 
exchange, for which, in President Roosevelt's opinion, the 
time was not yet ripe. His attitude aroused hostility and 
the conference finally broke up with little done. There 
have been many who therefore dubbed the conference a 
failure, yet no world conference in which mutual problems 
are discussed and national attitudes are made clear can be 
considered to have been futile even in the absence of direct 
achievements. 

Observers have already reported that the first reaction of 
resentment in Europe is giving way to interest in the Amer- 
ican domestic program and its results, and it is today 
being generally admitted, although still 
somewhat grudgingly, that President 
Roosevelt's course in London was justi- 
fied. Where at first the world and even 
observers in the United States saw only 
inconsistency and confusion in President

Early Days in the Constabulary 

By Wilfrid Turnbull 



EXCEPT at Catbalogan where the 
people seemed to be friendly, neither 
Americans nor Constabulary officers 
were popular in Samar in these years, at 
least where I went. The Borongeftos made 
no attempt to hide their feelings, and as 
I was always a very muddy and disreputable -looking in- 
dividual when I visited their town, no one could blame them, 
in my case, for aloofness. Once when feeling exceptionally 
lonely and after an extra shave and a bath, I borrowed some 
civilian clothes and sallied forth to ascertain what effect 
the disguise of cleanliness and absence of uniform would 
have on the haut monde. The result was eminently satis- 
factory and beyond my wildest dreams, until, in an un- 
guarded moment of mutual esteem and confidence, my 
comparer a learning what my occupation was, promptly 
left me, and whenever I saw her afterwards she sailed past 
with her nose in the air. Had I been at all inclined that 
way, such disappointment would doubtless have driven me 
to strong drink. When, as occasionally happened, we stop- 
ped overnight in a town or barrio, within a few minutes of 
our arrival, the female part of the population was busy 
doing its best to entertain the soldiers, but not even one 
of the octogenarian babaye would glance the way of the 
company commander. This, of course, did not bother me, 
but it might have done others in my position. 



there was one—and we had commissary and quartermaster 
privileges, we were unfortunately not always in touch 
with these sources of supply. Of course one would not 
expect to see much game when traveling with a column, but 
even around the different stations it was very scarce. Once 
when coming down a steep mountain stream, I got within 
a few feet of a deer but I was too much occupied to shoot it. 
That was the only live one I saw in Samar. However 
monkeys were everywhere and more attracted than repelled 
by our presence. I always carried a shotgun, and turning 
it over to a soldier at each halt would provide fresh meat 
for the outfit. There were shrimps in most of the mountain 
streams and a few minutes with a piece of bacon on a string 
would harvest a shrimp supper. The subsistence allowance 
for the Constabulary soldier was then twenty -one centavos 
a day and on this amount he lived well. No company was 
allowed to keep a cash saving of over 1^400.00 and it was 
often necessary to make rush purchases at the end of the 
month of bacon and tinned meats for which there was no 
immediate need, in order to keep within the prescribed 
limit. Being out of the station most of the time, and 
the cargador also being allowed twenty-one centavos for 
subsistence as we seldom carried anything but rice and 
dried fish, it was not infrequently hard to spend the savings. 
These were days of bacon at thirty centavos the pound and 
everything else in proportion. 




The Irish 

There being a decided coolness on the part of the average 
native son, it would seem hard to explain how Mr. McGuire 
at Borongan, after holding several other offices, was elected 
presidente of the town and how at Paranas, Mr. Shaugher 
was not only elected presidente but still, I believe, holds 
office under the provincial government. Whatever one's 
private opinion may be regarding the Irish in Ireland, 
where, it is true, they do not always appear to see quite 
eye to eye, it must be admitted that when away from home 
influences they not only fit in where others do not, but they 
have a habit of immediately starting to take over the local 
government — and generally with considerable success. 
This may explain the election to office of two Irish-Amer- 
icans in a, to others, not overly-friendly province. Need- 
less to say, the descendants of these pioneers will have to be 
reckoned with in the future political life of the country. 
It is not hard to visualize a plebiscite in the none too distant 
future deciding in favor of a king or a queen of Irish descent 
as the first of a long dynasty to rule these Islands, thereby 
assuring internal political tranquility and doing away with 
the ever present fear of forei^ aggression. I recall with 
appreciation the many favors and the frequent hospitality 
extended to me by Messrs. McGuire and Shaugher, in fact 
the last month I spent in Samar was at the former's house. 

Little Game 

Although with the exception of rice everything was cheaper 
in the Army commissary than in the local market — where 



A Poor Maestro 

Riding from Camp Meneke to Oris in order to get some 
registered mail addressed to that place instead of to Boron- 
gan, our post office town, I ran across an American teacher 
stationed in one of the intervening towns and living in the 
municipal building. On my return I reached the river at 
the outskirts of his town during the night, and, having 
heard so much about Samar crocodiles, I was afraid to 
cross and so spent the rest of the night on the river bank, 
which, from later experience, I now know to be equally 
dangerous. At daybreak, cold and hungry, I went into 
the town expecting to enlist the sympathy of the teacher 
to the extent of hot coffee at least. But, to my sorrow, he 
informed me that he had been without coffee for some time, 
that all he could get locally was rice and fish, and that the 
town officials, unwilling to spare a house, had put him up at 
the prSsidencia, This maestro was not much of a hust- 
ler, or he would have had a productive interview with the 
mayor or have left the town. I wanted him to come to 
Meneke and promised him supplies, but he never put in an 
appearance. Among the many crocodile stories told for the 
benefit of the new arrival was one by Governor Curry, ac- 
cording to which he and the vice- presidente of some town 
were walking along a river bank when a crocodile in the 
river knocked the vice-presidente into the water with its 
tail and disappeared with him. Crocodiles are to be found 
practically everywhere in the Islands but I did not happen 
to see one in Samar.

The Battle of Mactan 



ROSE slow the eastern sun 
Out of the darkness dun 
To watch in its long run 
Another battle. 
. It saw the chieftain's ire 
Hot stir the warriors' fire 
To whom more sweet than lyre 
Was kris's rattle. 



By VirglHo Floresca 




In Mactan lay a band 
Under the chief's command 
Prei)ared to free the land 

From the white stranger; 
The warriors fully know 
The day shall be of woe 
For terrible is the foe 

And great the danger. 

"My datus, friends and peers, 
Destroy those phantom fears, 
Long have with those sharp spears 

Yourselves defended. 
The foe is on the blue. 
Doth fearful danger brew, 
But his high pride shall rue 

Ere all is ended. 

*' Great Laon aids the just. 
Our foe he flings to dust, 
And firm and true we trust 

In his alliance. 
My warriors. Sons of War, 
That ne'er were vanquished, nor 
Have known a conqueror. 

Hurl your defiance. 

"Fight bold this enemy. 
Be not his mockery. 
Let not his cruel glee 

Gloat darkly o'er ye; 
*Tis they must tribute pay, 
'Tis they must sing the lay 
Of vile submission; they 

Must kneel before ye." 

The warriors all were stirred, 
And when was war-cry heard 
Their kris they did ungird 

For foeman's poniard; 
They stood there motionless 
In formed fearlessness. 
What moment they did bless 

Appeared the Spaniard. 

"Upon the foe, he comes! " 
That cry rose from the drums, 
And in the native homes 

Prayed many a woman. 
They rushed upon the shore. 
They rushed amidst the roar, 
And wild and fierce they tore 

On the proud foeman. 



Are these the servile weak 
The invader came to seek, 
Whom he had deemed so meek, 

Slaves these before him? 
Fierce hatred grim and stern 
That did with fury bum 
In them he did discern 

As they tore at him. 

But still his hopes did stand 
That his victorious band 
As e'er would win the land 

With wonted glory; 
His bright sword brandishing. 
He rushed like hero-king. 
Set and uncowering. 

In all his fury. 

Brave held his men their ground. 
For valor were renowned. 
But their grim efforts found 

That naught availed them — 
The natives, strong as they 
Did fly not nor give way; 
The invaders could not stay 

What fierce assailed them. 

Like leaves from parent tree 
Torn by the wind, did he 
His numbered comrades see 

On those sands scattered - 
He heard the victor's yell 
The roaring billows swell 
His woeful state to tell — 

His dreams all shattered. 

And Lapulapu slashed, 
Body on body crashed, 
And glad as God he clashed 

With mad Magellan; 
Crashed in a bloody toil 
The kris and cutlass; while 
Each other's skill did foil. 

Fell noble, villain. 

"O fly, Elcano, fly. 

Tell them how I did die. 

Iberia my last sigh," 

Magellan shouted, 
As he the havoc wrought 
Saw on his men distraught, 
Who in their pride ne'er thought 

They could be routed. 

He saw in eyes of hate 
The darkness of his fate 
As for him did await 

Their lances rais6d. 
With fury of despair 
Upon them he did tear, 
So fiercely fought he there 

They were amazed.

He Wanted To Be Vice-Presidente 

By Bienvenido N. Santos 



M' 



"ANG GENIO was a soldier of the revo- 
lution. He had participated in one of 
those skirmishes never recorded in his- 
tory, but written in the hearts of the few who 
survive to tell the tale. 

When elections were introduced in the small 
town of Santa Cruz, the first candidate for Vice-presi- 
dente was Mang Geniong Manalang. He was a young 
man then, robust and strong. 

But he was an old man now, slow of foot, and dim of eyes. 
Time lay heavily on his thin shoulders. He had only 
a few long, stained teeth left, and when he talked, some 
of his words skidded on his toothless gums, and passed out 
as mere sounds, not words. But in spite of this, Mang 
Genio loved to talk — of life, of philosophy, of the trend of 
the times, and always, of the past — of that revolution in 
which he had played a part. 

Mang Genio was poor, unlike his opponents who were 
usually landed proprietors. They rode in Ford cars from 
barrio to barrio delivering loud speeches. Mang Genio 
simply walked from barrio to barrio. There were rare 
times when some other candidate of his party, usually the 
candidate for presi dente, would give him a lift, and Mang 
Genio was volubly grateful. 

He also made speeches. The rustic citizens of the town 
found great amusement in listening to him. He would 
ascend the platform like a beloved hero, then slowly bow 
his head like a slave in an Oriental tale, and begin his speech 
with the tale of the revolution, ending with the same story. 

Elections had come and gone in the town of Santa Cruz, 
and Mang Genio was always a defeated candidate for the 
vice -presidency. He was never elected. When the returns 
were announced, he always polled the lowest number of 
votes. In the first election, he received only ten votes. 
His nearest relatives living at that time and himself 
must have been included in that number. And history, like 
bis oft repeated tale of the revolution, unerringly repeated 
itself every election year. 

But the old man persisted. He was determined to be 
vice-president of Santa Cruz before "he died. That was 
his open avowal. He had said that to the electorate time 
and again. There was something desperate and almost 
tragic in his determination. 

Children who had heard him deliver his first campaign 
speech were grown up people now. They could still re- 
member how Mang Genio had always related his one expe- 
rience during the revolution. As children, they had thrilled 
to the tale of bullets raining down on him. 

Now that they were old enough to vbte, or not to vote 
for him, thi§ speech about the revolution had grown stale, 
tedious, and absurd, even if it was not so with Mang Genio 
himself. 

As he grew older the picture he drew of the revolution, 
and his part in it seemed to grow more vivid. That one 
scene of the gory past began and climaxed every campaign 




speech he made. The whole town of Sta. Cruz could 
repeat it verbatim: 

***** and I was crawling behind a balete 
tree. In front of me men were falling. Right 
and left they seemed only to slip and tumble 
down, but they never rose again. Bullets were 
raining down on us — softly hissing bullets. As I turn- 
ed to help a fallen comrade, there was a dull swishing 
sound — tock! — and off went my hat. A bullet had 
pierced through the hat I was wearing, and ..." 

In the first two elections, he had the hat with him and 
exhibited it to the listening throng. But his habit of pas- 
sing the hat for inspection to some of his trusted companions 
and listeners proved fatal to this heroic relic of a bloody past. 
And so in the succeeding elections, Mang Genio had no 
more material evidence to show to the people, but the spirit 
of the story was there before them — the hero of that un- 
sung battlefield. 

During the last election the old man trudged along the 
rain-drenched paths from barrio to barrio, giving a good day 
or good evening at every house. He shook the hands of 
every man he met, requesting him almost tearfully to please 
vote for him this time as, who could tell, it might prove to 
be the last election he would ever live to see. 

**Now. Just this time!'* he urged them. **A single vote 
from you for me will not hurt, will it? I am very old now, 
as you see, and maybe I will be dead before my term is over. 
It has been, and still is, my only dream and hope to see 
myself vice-presidente of Santa Cruz. I want to serve our 
town in that capacity even as I served our country during 
the revolution. Then I could die happy. You shall have 
served an old man who had almost lost his life fighting for 
our beloved motherland. Because you know, during the 
revolution. . . .** 

At this point he reverted to his tale of the battlefield, 
the tall balete tree, the fusillade of bullets, comrades struck 
down beside him, the bullet through his hat. 

Many took pity on him. Especially the women. They 
coaxed their husbands to vote for the old man. The men 
were simply amused, and said that the old man could not 
do anything for the town if he were elected, that he did not 
even know how to write. 

Mang Genio*s rival for the vice-presidency was running 
for re-election. He was a rich, fat man who had many 
tenants under his power. In the past elections, he had 
bought slippers and cedulas fer some of the voters. But 
now that he realized that winning the vice-presidency over 
Mang Geniong Manalang had become a tradition, he did 
not exert himself much. 

In the meantime, throughout the day and far into the 
night Mang Genio campaigned from house to house — alone 
— praying for the people's votes, and, at last, touching 
their hearts.

Campfire Tales on the Beach 

''Siguey'' a Big Family, But All Beautiful and Jolly Fellows 

By Dr. Alfred Worm 



* T COULD wade over this coral-reef all 
I day and pick up tons of shells* and 
there still would be tons of them left.'* 
With these words a lady whom I had taken 
out on a large reef at low tide, deposited on 
the sandy beach a heavy load of beautiful 
sea shells she had carried to the shore. 

Panting from the long and difficult walk over the rough 
coral rocks, she sat down on the white, clean sand at my 
side. 

"The soles of my shoes are ruined from the salt water and 
the sharp edges of the corals, and look at my skirt, it is 
ripped to pieces, but I would not have missed this wonder- 
ful experience for anything. Look at those beauties!" 

I smiled synlpathetically over the enthusiasm of the lady, 
who, though rich in earthly goods, had lived a life estranged 
from nature. 

There was nothing extraordinarily valuable among these 
shells, they were only the common kinds found along the 
beach and in shallow water, but nevertheless beautiful they 
were and with brilliant colors, as they were still alive, with 
the animals inside, and not like those dead ones bleached 
by the sun. 

**Now, please, doctor, 'tell me a story about them," the 
lady begged, and picking up one small shell at random, she 
asked, "What is this, and what do you call it?" 

"You have just picked the one shell of them all, it would 
take me the rest of your vacation to talk about, as it is a 
member of the largest family of the sea shells, the cowries", 
I said. 

"Cowries? Are they the kind I have read about in books, 
which the natives of Africa use as money?" 

"The cowrie you speak about is that little, polished shell 
that you see crawling away from the rest; the animal is 
trying to get back into the water", I said as I bent to pick 
it up and laid it in the lady's hand for inspection. 

"The cowries, called in the native language siguey, 
belong to the family Cjrpracea, of the molluscs or soft bodied 
animals, such as the snails, slugs, clams, oysters, the beau- 
tiful and delicate paper nautilus, and also the squid and 
octopus. 

A large number of these humble creatures are of great 
economic importance to man and form important articles 
of commerce, furnishing him not only with food, but with 
the costly pearl, and also with the beautiful "mother of 
pearl" fronji which buttons are made, and with the window- 
shells you see in Manila, while others gladden the heart 
of mankind by their strange shapes and beautiful colors, 
serving as ornaments for house or garden. 

But let us talk today of the large family of cowries, and 
some other time I will tell you more about the others. 

Look at the pile of shells you have collected. 

You will notice a number of them resemble each other 
in form, though some arc large, others small, and they vary 

ISO 



in color, but all are very smooth and have thick, hard walls, 
with a long, narrow slit, the edges of which are serrated, 
on the underside. From this slit the living snail, for such 
it is, extends a part of its body when moving about or feeding. 

These all belong to the family of cowries, and all are 
beautiful and lively fellows, spending more time in crawling 
around than any other species of mollusc, often wandering 
very far. 

I have spoken already of the Money cowrie, and there 
are several kinds of them, differing slightly in size, shape, 
and color. One of them, of a light, delicate yellow, with 
round protuberances on each side, and three dark stripes 
across the back, is a great favorite with the people here, who 
call it Sefiora, which means Lady, but is somewhat rare, 
as among thousands one finds but one or two. Another 
little cowrie of a plump, round form, resembling the body 
of a little pig, is called in the native language baboy, — pig. 

Large quantities of money cowries are brought to Manila 
to serve various purposes, — as "marbles" for the boys, 
"chips" in card-games, and decoration on picture frames 
and boxes to which they are glued in various patterns. 
They are frequently exported to China and Japan, where 
they are strung on threads to make curtains. 

The largest of the cowrie family is the beautiful mottled 
Tiger cowrie which our ladies use in mending stockings, 
inserting it under the damaged part, the smooth surface 
of the shell serving as a guide for the needle. It is also used 
in the shell-craft industry, a circular piece being removed 
from the top of the shell and a colored plush or silk cushion 
being fitted in to serve as a holder for pins. 

A smaller kind, also beautifully spreckled with white, 
brown, and black, is the Leopard cowrie. The snow- 
white Egg cowrie is almost as large as the tiger cowrie, and 
closely resembles a chicken egg, from which it derives its 
name. Very beautiful also is the Skunk cowrie, which 
derives its name from its shining black color with a white 
stripe along the center of its back, the humped form also 
closely resembling a resting skunk in miniature. 

Moro and pagan tribes living near the sea shore use very 
small, white, almost round cowries to make necklaces. 
These small cowries were some years ago also in demand by 
a local manufacturer of shell articles, and I shipped quite 
a quantity of these to him. 

Of all the many more cowries which occur in the Philip- 
pine Islands, I shall mention only one more, as it is not 
found anywhere else outside these Islands. Even here it is 
very rare, and although it is not used for any industrial 
purpose, shell-collectors pay good prices for it. This is the 
beautiful Aurora cowrie, one specimen of which was sold 
some years ago to a wealthy Chinese in Manilla for P35.00 
with the promise that he would buy more at that price if 
they should be found. The Chinese could well afford this 
price, as undoubtly he could dispose of this shell for many 
times the amount he paid for it in the Celestial Kingdom,

The Philippine Home 

Edited by Mrs, Mary Macdonald 
Protect Children Against Fatigue 

TN the days of my childhood when I 
W ^^^^ ^ protest at times about the 

r ^I^^H number of household duties and tasks 
Y that I was required to perform, my elders 

^^jJHm were accustomed to remark: ''Hard work 
never hurt any one." Personally, I doubt 
this very much, especially in the light of recent knowledge 
which comes to us from physicians and health authorities. 
The hard work part of it may be a good thing. Certainly, 
industry continues to be a homely virtue, and we need 
much more of it in the younger generation. But the rub 
comes from the fatigue that is the result of hard work, or 
hard play, or over-exertion of any kind. 

It seems as though children's lives are too crowded every 
day with things that must be done. They may not be 
required to do so much household work or chores as the 
youngsters of a former generation, but they do have crowded 
programs including school, music lessons, social activities, 
and what not, so that they are *'on the go*' from early in 
the morning until bedtime. Watchful parents will insist on 
rest and relaxation in the middle of the day, and will require 
an early hour for retiring so that growing boys and girls 
will get a full quota and extra measure of health-restoring 
sleep. 

It is generally recognized that a tired child is very sus- 
ceptible to common colds with all the evils that this malady 
may bring in its train. It is the fatigued, worn-out child 
who gets the diseases that are going around.** The lack 
of proper rest results in nervous, high-strung temperaments 
which have an ill effect upon the child as well as his as- 
sociates. 

The value of rest and plenty of sleep is of more importance 
in our tropical climate, than in the temperate zones. The 
continuous heat has a tendency to sap vitality which can 
only be restored and preserved by liberal doses of rest and 
sleep. And of course the room in which children sleep 
should have plenty of air, the sleeping garments should be 
light in weight and comfortable, the beds should be clean 
and protected with mosquito nets, and the right amount of 
covering provided so that they will not be too warm or too 
cold. Small pillows are necessary to insure comfort. 

The importance of rest for children of all ages during the 
hottest part of the day cannot be emphasized too much. 
Even though they may not sleep, they should be required 
to lie still for at least half an hour, so that they will be 
entirely relaxed. Such a rest will be refreshing and prevent 
the fatigue that is sure to result without such a siesta period. 

Children who get their full quota of sleep have the alert 
minds and healthy bodies which make them stand out 
among their associates at school and on the playground, 
and who find it easier to enter into the busy life which our 
modern mode of living requires even from our boys and 
girls of tender years. 



It's Time to Teach Safety-First 

T^vBN the most casual reading of the newspapers these 
days will convince one that motor car accidents in 
Manila and even in the provinces are on the increase. The 
thing that is most alarming is the number of children who 
are being struck down and injured or killed. The cause 
of most of these accidents is carelessness, either on the 
part of the persons who are hurt or the drivers of the cars, 
or both. Very often it is not easy to fix the responsibility. 
The sad fact only remains that some youngster has been 
badly injured, perhaps maimed for life, or killed. 

The situation seems to call for a well organized safety 
campaign in which public officials, school teachers and 
school authorities. Boy Scouts, parents, automobile as- 
sociations, and the children themselves should cooperate. 
We have read of several rather indifferent attempts to do 
something about these accidents, but nothing of much 
importance has come from them. One continues to find 
children pla5ang in busy streets, pedestrians walking list- 
lessly down the middle of important thoroughfares, and no 
effort made for a systematic campaign of education which 
would unquestionably result in saving the lives of a large 
number of children in the Philippines each year. 

One also sees public vehicles, such as street cars and 
trucks in Manila, overcrowded with school children who 
are allowed to take their chances with fast moving vehicles 
when they embark or alight at crowded street intersections. 
The wonder of it all is that there are not more serious ac- 
cidents than actually occur, but that should not prevent 
the undertaking of a general campaign for the adoption 
and observance of safety measures. 

Not all of the safety observance should be confined to the 
children and pedestrians. Motor car and truck drivers 
should also be enlisted so that they will observe cautioQ 
at all times and take care to see that their vehicles are 
under control so that accidents may be reduced or entirely 
prevented. 

It would be an easy matter to draw up a safety code for 
school children and require instruction in it. This would 
take up a very small amount of time, but would be of 
countless value in cutting down the toll of accidents. Safety- 
first posters, with a list of rules and regulations, could be 
put up in public markets, school buildings, public plazas, 
and other places where crowds usually congregate. The 
proverbial ounce of prevention is always worth taking, 
and the prevention of serious automobile accidents is 
important enough to enlist the support of every public 
spirited citizen. 

Use the Can Opener 

YOUNG married woman of my acquaintance recently 
announced to her husband that she was going to 
dismiss her cook and do the cooking herself, the cook's 
salary going to her for spending money. "I'll bring home 
a flock of can-openers for you tonight," was hubby's good- 
natured retort. 

"Why not open a few cans," the young woman chal- 
lenged. "Canned food is always wholesomfc* tasty, and 

201 



appetizing, and it offers us almost endless variety including 
meats, vegetables, fruit, and desserts. You'll be surprised 
how much you'll like my canned meals, and it won't be 
expensive either." 

Her experiment proved pleasant and profitable. Sure 
enough, the canned foods which she occasionally served 
were thoroughly relished. She studied her cook books for 
new ways of preparing and serving them, and found that 
they were not expensive, and truly provided an almost 
endless variety. She made trips to the market, of course, 
for some fresh vegetables and seasonable fruits, but the 
markets fell short of the variety which was to be found on 
her grocer's shelf in tins of popular brands. One thing 
she learned which has an important bearing on ecpnomy 
in the food budget. She avoided left-overs as much as 
possible. By making sure that every food brought to the 
table tasted well and looked attractive, there were no dabs 
remaining to be stuck into the ice box. 

You might be interested in one or two of her favorite 
dishes. Here they are: 

Baked Sliced Ham with Glazed Apricots 

1 tlicc raw ham. about 1 kilo 2 cups of canned apricots 

1V4 teaspoon whole cloves 2 cups apricot juice 

3 tablespoons brown sugar cinnamon and cloves 

Sear the ham on both sides in the skillet, then place it in a baking dish, 
stick the cloves around the edge of the ham, and cover the top of it 
with the brown sugar, apricots, and spices. Pour all the apricot juice 
over it. Bake in a hot oven for an hour and a half, or until tender. 
Scalloped potatoes, to serve with the ham, are baked in the same oven. 



6 halves of canned pears 
2 ounces cream cheese 
1 tablespoon lemon juice 



Pear and Ginfter Salad 

* 6 tablespoons chopped preserved ginger 
6 tablespoons mayonnaise 
1 tablespoon preserved ginger syrup 



Arrange one-half a pear on a bed of lettuce. Divide the cream cheese 
into six portions and shape into balls, rolling each in the chopped ginger 
drained of its syrup. Place one ball in each pear half. Thin the mayon- 
naise with the ginger syrup and lemon juice and combine with the 
rest of the ginger not used with the cheese balls. Arrange this dressing 
on each salad and serve. 



Raspberry Sherbet 

1 package raspberry gelatin 1 can of raspberries 

2 cups of water 10 tablespoons lemon juice 
1 cup of sugar 

Dissolve gelatin in one cup of water. Combine the sugar and one cup 
of water, and stir over a low heat until the sugar is dissolved. Bring 
to a boil and cook for ten minutes. Add to the gelatin mixture with the 
raspberries and lemon juice. Cool and rub through a fine sieve. Pour 
into the freezing tray of an automatic refrigerator and freeze until set, 
stirring every 30 minutes. This dessert may also be frozen in an or- 
dinary ice cream freezer, if desired.

Mr. Gaudencio Ramirez, of Tarlac, Tarlac, was the first of several readers to 
call our attention to the error in the answer to Questicn No. 4 in the list of questions 
published in the September issue, and was therefore given a complimentary subscrip- 
tion to the Philippine Magazine foi one year. Asbestos has been reported from 
Ilocos Norte and not Ilocos Sur; as erroneously stated. 

Mr. Mauro Garcia of Manila first reported the copyist's error m the answer to 
Question No. 20. The music of the march was written by Julian Felipe in 1898, 
the words by Jos6 Palma in 1899. He also receives a year's free 9ubscription to 
the Magazine 

Several readeis questioned the answer to Question No. 1, holding that the first 
church of San Agustin in Manila is the oldest church. The question, however, was 
not what was the oldest church buiUling^ but the oldest church. The original Santo 
Nifio church was built in 1571, the first San Agustin church five years later. 



The Hinal-o or Pestle Dance 

{Continued from page 182) 

pestles again, twice they were knocked together, then 
banged down again. One, two, three — tong-tong-bang- 
tong-tong-bang — always in time with the music. 

The two dancers began to skip and jump, over and be- 
tween the pounding, crashing pestles. The clanging of the 
pestles made a weird and savage sound, yet rhythmic and 
rich. The tempo of the clashing wooden pestles increased 
as the young men leapt gaily and buoyantly between them. 

Pong-pong-bang! Pong-pong-bang! Faster and faster 
clashed the pestles, but still vigorously and yet gracefully 
the dancers danced on between the flashing, crashing pestles. 
Swinging and bending, lightly and wildly, but expertly, 
they exchanged places, and with arms swinging, they leapt 
and whirled on with seemingly inexhaustible energy and 
courage. 

When the guitarist stopped playing because his song was 
ended, a wild shout of applause came from the crowd. 
The dancers bowed again and the liberal teniente del 
barrio pressed upon them a gift of some palay and several 
meters of cloth. 

Returning home with my friends I asked when I might 
see another pestle dance. At the next harvest season, 
perhaps, he said.

He Wanted to be Vice-Presidente 

{Continued from pa^e 199) 

On the eve of the election, Mang Genio looked more dead 
than alive. His cheeks were hoUower than ever. There 
was no light in his eyes as he watched and waved weakly 
at the crowds of people carrying banners, and parading the 
streets. His face was haggard as he smiled wanly at auto- 
mobiles full of men that would suddenly come swooping 
down the dark provincial road that night, shouting, shout- 
ing long live somebody. 

Mang Genio did not go to bed. Some of the people 
jeered at him when they recognized his dark, wrinkled face 
in the dim lights of many stores, as he walked about the 
town aimlessly. They shouted at him: "Hullo vice- 
president!** Mang Genio only smiled at them — no, it was 
not a smile. 

But the next day when the official counting was over, 
Mang Geniong Manalang was shown to have polled a 
considerable majority over his rich opponent. 

When Mang Genio was informed of his victory, he be- 
lieved it at once, for it was his only son Culas who brought 
him the happy tidings. But the truth of his triumph 
seemed only to come to him crushingly a few moments 
later. He was still for many seconds, and when he tried 
to speak, his voice was like a dead man's, so hollow, so 
unearthly did it sound. 



"Did I win? Did I win? Am I really elected? Am I 
really elected?*' he repeated oddly, as he stared unseeingly 
at those around him. 

A great, gripping weakness had come over him suddenly. 
He could not even walk home. And his house was just 
a short distance away. He tottered when he tried to move 
his legs. Culas had to help him. They were met at the 
stairs by a little boy, Mang Genio*s grandson. The child 
watched the old man sink slowly into a chair, and close 
his eyes. He seemed to fall asleep. 

And he had a dream. 

He was crouching behind a tall balete tree. Right and 
left, and in front of him men were falling, and never rose 
again. Bullets were raining down on him. As he turned 
to help a fallen comrade, there was a swishing sound . . . 
tock! and off went his hat. He tried to crawl towards it, 
but he could not move. 

And there the dream ended. 



The Battle of Mactan

But as he strove he knew 
His hours of life were few 
And o'er him darkly grew 

Death's shade descending.

Upon that fatal shore, 
A kris on his crest tore, 

His glory ending.

where rare and remarkable objects are always believed to be 
endowed with mysterious powers or magic forces which 
will bring the owner luck and prosperity. The Aurora 
cowrie is of a delicate pale pink color, and at once attracts 
attention, and can not be mistaken for cowries of other 
species. 

At certain times cowries, especially the various kind of 
money cowries, assemble in great numbers in one locality, 
while at other seasons of the year not one can be found at 
these places. The Moros ascribe this phenomenon to the 
moon, but as a matter of fact they come into the shallow 
water over the coral-reefs to deposit their eggs beneath 
the rocks. Cowries prefer a rocky bottom, and are rarely 



found on sandy beadies where no rocks occur. 

They are the persecuted and suffering victims of the 
starfishes, which wrap their nasty arms around them and 
insert their suckers into the opemng of the shell and feed 
on the soft meat of poor little siiuey, whom nature has 
not endowed with means to defend himself, unlike many 
other molluscs which are equipped with acid or poisonous 
fluids which they are able to eject in time of need. 

Though the family is not of much economic importance 
to man, the great number of cowries in such a multitude 
of beautiful colors, enlivens the aspect of the sea shore and 
gladdens the hearts of those who love nature's living crea- 
tures.

A Beautiful Jungle Island 
Most parts of the Philippines have their distinctive and 
attractive scenery and Samar is by no means an exception. 
I shall always recall the beauty of its mountain rivers. 
Some are roaring torrents confined by steep-walled ravines 
covered with tropical plants, and with vines, hanging down 
several hundred feet, alive with monkeys and varicolored 
parrots and other birds. Others are slow-moving over solid 
rock, with water of every shade of blue, and these not in- 
frequently disappear in the ground or in caves to reappear 
at a distance. Some of the grottos connecting with these 
rivers are beautiful and remind one of Capri's blue grotto 
on a small scale. I was fortunate in making the trip down 
the Ylat river from Ilokiloko (?) to Sulat, but not fortunate

in choice of season for the water being low, it took us from 
midday to midnight— about twice the time ordinarily 
required. There is only one short portage around a steep 
fall into a boiling caldron between enormous rocks, and 
there being no rapids the ride is not exciting, but the scenery 
well repays one for the rather tedious and uncomfortable 
trip by bancs. An outboard motor would make it more 
enjoyable. Except for a few small clearings made by people 
in hiding, dense jungle reached to the water's edge and the 
only means of access was by river. Wild ducks were so 
tame and plentiful one could have filled the banca with them, 
and after dark I kept my head below the banca sides so as 
to avoid being hit by those sleeping on the water and fright- 
ened by the passage of our craft. 

Love Pangs 

I have often been an interested onlooker at the trials and 
tribulations of courtship. Most of these cases are a source 
of wonder at the male's ability to show himself to such 
advantage and at the credulity of the quarry—probably 
more apparent than real— but we had a case at Camp 
Meneke in which the unfortunate youth became intermit- 
tently deranged. Following each arrival of States mail, 
this young officer would sit and mope over his letters for 
days and then take fits of rushing out of the house, tearing 
up correspondence and jumping on the pieces to the accom- 
paniment' of horrible language. These demonstrations of 
love gradually became less frequent and energetic until, 
shortly before the arrival of the next mail, the sufferer 
again became normal. On one expedition he and I shared 
the same shelter for two nights, but this saving of labor in 



shelter-building had to be abandoned on account of his 
flopping over like a fish on his cot every few minutes and 
preventing me from sleeping. Remonstrance on my part 
elicited the information that the flopping was purely invo- 
luntary and bothered him much more than it did me. 
After some of his men were drowned in fording a river, he 
became worse and, getting back to the station, was invalided 
to Manila. Some months later I saw this love-sick boy, 
still somewhat wild -eyed but a different individual to the 
one I had known in Samar. He left for the United States, 
and report had it that upon arrival he married the cause 
of his apparent candidacy for a lunatic asylum — a girl 
worth a million dollars in her own right. Who would not 
undergo temporary derangement for such reward! After 
this unfortunate officer's departure there were only two left 
with the companies at Meneke — Captain Inglesby and my- 
self. Inglesby was far too civilized for the life and I always 
felt sorry for him being marooned in such a place. An 
engineer by profession, when not in the hills his recreation 
consisted of mapping the surrounding country and keeping 
us supplied with edible birds. Once after a few days in the 
mountains, several of my men fell ill with smallpox and as 
few inhabitants of the Islands were protected by vaccina- 
tion in those days I expected to have to build and run a 
hospital in the hills, but no new cases developing, after 
sending the sick to a detention camp near the station, we 
continued the hike. Just before leaving Meneke we had 
sent a sick man from Inglesby's company to the Scout hos- 
pital at Borongan were after a few days, we learned upon 
our return, his case also turned out to be smallpox. These, 
however, were the only ones.

An Involuntary Bath 
Returning from Borongan one afternoon, I hired a sailing 
boat to take me from San Julian to our camp. It was 
during the north-east monsoon with the usual strong wind 
and rough sea, both of which were favorable. Having 
secured the boat through the presidente, I had paid no 
special attention to the two boatmen, but when we were 
well off shore it became evident that both were very drunk. 
All the local men being good sailors and drunkeness not 
rare, I thought nothing of it and went to sleep to wake and 
find myself and pony equipment in the water and the camp 
still a mile away. The bath had a sobering effect on the 
boatmen who collected my belongings and told me that 
wind and tide being in our favor we should reach the shore 
almost as quickly as if the boat were not submerged. Hang- 
ing on to the outriggers, we made fairly good time, our feet 
occasionally touching the sand between waves. From the 
suppressed chuckles and the faces of my two companions, 
I felt pretty certain that the show had been staged for my 
benefit. However I was in no position to do anything 
about it, even cursing was difficult in the surf, and by the 
time we reached the shore my anger had subsided. The 
joke was on me. The Visayan is the best sailor in the 
Philippines and an indifferent one is out of place on the 
east coast of Samar. 

Visitors 

For several weeks we had a very interesting visitor, a 
Filipino general and former officer of General Lukban's, 
who was collecting certain data for the U. S. Government. 
One day he received a telegram from his wife directing 
him to loose no time in coming home. Showing us the 
message, he explained that he had left the sefiora in charge 
of their hacienda and that she in her loneliness and grief 
at the separation was possibly suspicious regarding the 
manner in which he was spending his time as once in the 
past she had even accused him of infidelity, an offense, 
he explained almost unknown in the Philippines. To our 
suggestion that he reply official business would not allow 
of his immediate return, he told us no such excuse would 
succeed with the lady in question. The general left that 
day, promising to write, but we never heard from him 
probably for fear something in our return letter might arouse 
the suspicion of his better half. Years later, after telling 
General Lukban about our visitor, he gave me a word 
picture of the lady and I no longer blamed her husband for 
prompt obedience. There were few other visitors. I 
remember General Harbord arrived one evening after dark. 
He inspected the companies next morning by lantern light, 
and left immediately after breakfast so as to make con- 
nection with a steamer. Captain Wheate of the Telegraph 
Division, Bureau of Posts, also inspected the local telegraph 
office. 

The life was a hard one and lonely, but I really enjoyed it. 
In the hills one was on the move all day, in the evening 
ravenous hunger made food in quantity the dominant 
consideration, and after supper one was generally too sleepy 
even to think — a typical animal life. Back at the station 
after having read everything that had come in since one's

The Rainy 
Season 




The Rainy Season by Ruiz 

The Rainy Season means little to youth, 
but it is quite another story in old age. 

In your old age, you will want shelter 
and protection. 

The best way of preparing for the rainy 
seasons to come is to secure an adequate 
amount of "Life Insurance**.

departure, the daily routine, lack of hard exercise, and eating 
too much soon palled on one, and I was always glad to 
return to the hills. In the absence of civilized society and 
by this I mean real women, and of books, there are only 
about two generally available diversions giving a real 
"kick**, both of which are to be found in quantity if not in 
quality practically everywhere except in the hills. I was 
not so wedded to the life that my transfer to Albay was 
unpleasing. It meant a step nearer to semi-civilization 
and upon arrival at Legaspi I was not sorry nor ungrateful 
to find that my destination has been changed to Baguio. 



Editorials 

{Continued from page 196) 
Roosevelt*s policy, it is now realized that he, after perhaps 
some hesitation, saw his way clearly before him and follow- 
ed it unswervingly. 

Many tasks confront the world which must be under- 
taken on an international basis, but there are most pressing 
problems attempts at the solution of which can not be 
delayed until international action can be secured — which 
might still be decades in the future. Among these prob- 
lems are those inter-related with unemployment and the 
suffering, hunger, and social unrest which follows from it. 

Just as the inhabitants of a small village must first put 
their own houses and yards in order before much can be 
done to clean up the town, so the nations of the world 
must in these extraordinarily difficult days give their 
principal attention to their own domestic problems before 
matters of international interest can be attended to, or 
before even these same originally domestic problems, as 
their ramifications extend into the international field, can be 
adequately dealt with. In bringing order into its own 
affairs, every nation best serves the world order.

Sports in the Philippines 

(Continued from page 193) 

Little Baseball Rivalry- 
Next comes baseball. America's national pastime has 
been introduced with more or less successful results. The 
game in Manila probably parallels in age the arrival of 
Americans thirty odd years ago. And hence the same 
elements that make for popularity in America are demanded 
here — fast baseball, keen rivalry, and excellent park ac- 
commodations. 

There are a lot of people in Manila. From a population 
of 400,000 or more, baseball should receive generous sup- 
port. Yet, during the waning days of the Philippine Base- 
ball League season the attendance at Alunan Park was of 
the scattered and sparsely settled variety. We dropped 
in on Judge Frank B. Ingersoll not so long ago to discuss 
the 1933-1934 season. It is easily apparent that the base- 
ball situation here is different. In order to create the proper 
rivalry, there must be a hometown squad, an all-Filipino 
team, or maybe more, and at least one all-American ag- 
gregation. 

This would constitute a four-team circuit. It is the con- 
sensus of the directors that a six-club league is unwieldly, 
and as the Manila park is the only real source of revenue, 
it is impossible for Manila to support six teams. This

deduction comes, not from thccMy, but from experience. 

However, if powerful financial interests in Manila, together 
with the service branches, would put clubs in the field, 
properly equipped, properly financed, without depending 
too much on gate receipts, we believe a faster quality of 
baseball could be developed here. Perhaps that has already 
been tried out, and has been found to be a failure. But we 
still contend that baseball should be one of the ace sports 
of the Islands. 

Golf Popular 
So far as we can observe, Manila goes in for golf in a big 
way. The Municipal course, picturesque, convenient, and 
within reach of any pocketbook, is a big boost for the game. 
This writer has never before seen a golf course just like this 
one, with the twentieth century flanking it on one side and 
the walls of the sixteenth century throwing their shadows 
across it from another. 

Polo and Horseracing 

Polo is deep rooted and popular with the American com- 
munity. But the Filipinos do not play the game. It seems 
to me that if the Filipino turns to horseracing, as he evident- 
ly does, he would turn to polo, also. Perhaps he likes the 
racetrack because of the gambling feature. Which reminds 
me that racing has plenty of followers hereabouts, and 
while the events are not conducted on a grand scale, such 
as one sees in Buenos Aires, Calcutta, Shanghai, in American 
cities, in England, or in Australasia, they are colorful and 
well attended. 

But getting back to polo. It is essentially an army pas- 
time. But it has caught on with the civilian Americans, 
and the polo season in Manila is awaited with eagerness 
each year. 

Big Soccer Games 
Soccer and rugby, good, lively outdoor diversions, have 
entered the athletic life of the community rather firmly. 
So thoroughly is this so, that excellent teams come here 
from China to show the local lads how it is done. As proof 
of the popularity of these games, tremendous crowds usually 
attend the big contests. 

Tennis Going Strong 

I have placed boxing first in this review. Perhaps I 
shouldn't. But at the moment it appears to be the most 
consistently popular diversion in the Philippine sports 
realm. Tennis, however, must not be slighted. Here's 
a type of game that seems to suit the Filipino. In fact, 
it has taken him by storm. On every court, in every 
section of the city, you will find trim young men and women 
wielding racquets with splendid ability. There should, 
sooner or later, go out from these islands, some champion- 
ship contenders. 

Why not? If the Japanese can excel in tennis, even to 
the point of having their experts penetrate to the last 
rounds of Davis cup eliminations, why shouldn't the Fili- 
pino be able to do the same thing? He is naturally agile 
and alert. With the proper coaching and training, plus 
incentive, the youth of this coimtry should be able to enter 
the big tournaments of the world. 

The Opportunity for Swimming 
I have marveled that swimming has not taken a deeper 
hold in the islands. The climate is ideal for it. The draw-

bBick, without question, has been the lack of pools and in- 
structors. This latter handicap is being eliminated, as in 
recent years — even in the last twelve months — fine tanks 
have been dedicated in Manila. 

We come to another comparison with Japan. The Nip- 
ponese swimmers are the fastest in the world today. Why 
shouldn't the Filipinos gamer equal honors? The feat can't 
be accomplished in a day or in a year. Training must 
start at an early age, and it must be continuous and thorough 
until a boy or girl reaches the adult period. Haphazard 
methods, haphazard incentive, haphazard support will 
never develop swimmers. An inspection of methods in 
Los Angeles, Chicago, Hawaii, or Japan, will inform you 
correctly on this point. 

Official Encouragement Needed 
A universal handicap to the full development of all sports 
in Manila, and throughout the archipelago, is the depressing 
lack of parks and playgrounds. One can not expect a child 
to develop a love for the healthful outdoors if he is boxed 
in and hedged about by the confines of a narrow street and 
never permitted to mix and mingle with other children, 
under proper supervision, in clean and attractive surround- 
ings. It is in the parks and on the public playgrounds that 
the child begins his career as an athlete. 

I have observed several instances since coming to Manila 



that seem to indicate that city officials and school author- 
ities, and even the Philippine legislators, are not as sym- 
pathetic towards sports as they should be. It is a mistake. 
Children need to play healthful games if they would develop 
healthful bodies and minds. 

But, taken all in all, there is a warmth of spirit and a 
genuine enthusiasm for athletic achievement in the Philip- 
pines that needs only a few championships, or championship 
winners — whether in boxing, baseball, tennis, golf, basket- 
ball, or swimming — to set the country on fire. Let's hope 
these champions are developed.

tricate costumes. But wherever they went, eyes followed, 
remarks were made, and both interest and pleasure were 
shown. 

Most of the men wore Chicago dress, only a few the 
baroni Tagalog. One spoiled the effect of his rather too 
transparent barong by wearing gaudy suspenders under it. 

The two orchestras that assisted were regular ones, 
working in the fair, and in the hotels and ball rooms of 
Chicago. They were quite representative of our Philippine 
music. 

Mr. Ramon Crispo will be remembered by radio fans as 
a popular Manila broadcaster during past years, and Mag- 
dalena Calloway, known as ''Maggie'' on the vaudeville 
stage in Manila, is studying dancing in America. 

We might have had more interesting exhibits, but the 
Tourist Association had no funds for this purpose and most 
of the goods that were shown were loaned or consigned for

The Minimum Course in Gregg 

Shorthand 

FOR THEORY CLASSES 

Gregg Shorthand Manual — A simple presentation of the principles of Gregg Shorthand, arranged in the 
order of their usefulness in mastering the 5,000 most-used words. 

Gregg Speed Studies— This text is well-named The Inseparable Companion to the Manual, It should be placed 
in the hands of the student at the time he receives his Manual. Its 314 pages are packed with the 
following helpful theory aids: Shorthand penmanship drills. • Vocabulary drills completing the 
5,000 most-used words. • Brief-form derivative drills. • 100 sentences using all the orief forms. 
• Similar-word drills. • Shorthand gazetteer of foreign countries. • Graded dictation—over 
10,000 running words— on each chapter of the Manual. • Ungraded dictation — 100 pages of 
up-to-date letters and articles — for use during the last weeks of the theory course. 

The student who uses "Gregg Speed Studies" has the correct outlines always before him while learning, for 
all this supplementary material is written in beautiful shorthand. 

FOR ADVANCED CLASSES 

Gregg Speed Building— This text is itself a daily teaching plan. No more need for the advanced shorthand 
teacher to prepare theory reviews or adapt the material in a dictation book to building speed. Every 
day's assignment is already scientifically organized for the student in his own text. You will be especially 
pleased with its vocabulary previews, four complete motivated reviews of the Manual, warming-up speed 
letters, spelling-improvement drills, and illustrated definitions of important words in thirteen major voca- 
tions. All material counted by the new standard word, insuring a uniform rate of dictation.

where etse, maldng notes, etc. The steamship companies 
might have extended more help in the way of furnishing 
illustrated folders and maps. But in spite of these short- 
comings, due chiefly to the lack of Government support, 
and after seeing the Philippine Day program, with its 
mmple, imprepared effects, and its air of modesty, I am 
of the final opinion that the Philippine part of the Exhibi- 
tion was much more appropriate and acceptable as it was 
than if it had been attempted to carry it off in the "high 
silk hat and white spats" style, and with all the official 
pomp so dear to the heart of officials who go at public 
expense and who try to make us appear far more advanced 
than we really are. 

It was a pleasure to congratulate Mr. Steele and those 
who took part in the program, and to wish our people hap- 
piness and prosperity, all those at home in the Islands, as 
well as the exiles scattered from California to New York, 
and especially those in and around Chicago, who gave 
their help freely to make the Philippine Day a success. 



Midsummer 

(Continued from page 184) 
His hair which was wavy, cut short behind but long in front, 
had fallen in a cluster over his forehead. 

**Let me hold the bucket while you drink/* she offered. 

He flashed her a smile over his shoulder. Then he poured 
the water into her jar, and again lowered the bucket. 

"No, no, you must not do that.*' She hurried to his 
side and held one of his arms. "I couldn't let you, a 
stranger. ..." * 



''Why not?" He smiled down at her. He noticed a slight 
film of moisture clinging to the down on her upper lip and 
experienced a sudden desire to wipe it away with his fore- 
finger. He continued to lower the bucket while she had to 
stand by. 

"Hadn't you better move over to the shade?" he sug- 
gested as the bucket struck the water. 

"What shall I do there?" she asked sharply as though 
the idea of seeking protection from the heat were contempt- 
ible to her. 

"You will get fried standing here in the sun," he said as 
he began to haul up the bucket. 

But she continued to stand beside him, catching the rope 
as it fell from his hands, coiling it carefully. The jar was 
filled with plenty to spare. Then he meekly gave her the 
bucket and she held it up and told him to drink as she tilted 
the half-filled can until the water lapped the rim. He 
gulped a mouthful of water, gargled noisily, spewed it out, 
then commenced to drink in earnest. He took long, deep 
draughts of the sweetish water, for he was more thirsty 
than he had thought. A chuckling sound persisted in 
forming inside his throat at every swallow. It made him 
self-conscious. He was breathless when through, and red 
in the face. 

"I don't know why it makes that sound," he said, finger- 
ing his throat and laughing shamefacedly. 

"Father also makes that sound when he drinks, and 
mother always laughs at him," she said. She untied the 
headkerchief over her hair and started to roll it.

The sun had descended cmsiderably, and there was now 
hardly any shade under the tree. The bull was gathering 
with its tongue stray slips of straw. The man had untied 
the animal to lead it to the other side of the gorge where the 
high bank was beginning to throw some shade, when the 
girl spoke: **Manong, why don't you come to our house 
and bring your animal with you? There is shade there 
and you can sleep, though our house is very poor." 

She had already placed the jar on top of her head and 
stood, half -turned toward him, waiting for his answer. 

"It would be troubling you . . 

"No. You come. I have told mother about you." 
She turned and went down the path as though she had said 
too much. 

He sent the bull after her with a smart slap on its side. 
Then he quickly gathered the remains of his meal, put them 
inside the jute sack which had almost dried, and himself 
followed. The bull had stopped to nibble the tufts of grass 
that dotted the bottom of the gorge. He picked up the 
dragging rope of the animal and urged it on into a trot. 
Man and animal caught up with her near the cart. She 
had stopped to wait. 

"Our house is just beyond that point," she said, indicating 
the spur of land topped by the sickly bamboo. "We have 
no neighbors." 

He did not volunteer a word. He walked a step behind, 
the bull lumbering ahead. More than ever he was con- 
scious of her person. She carried the jar on her head without 
holding it. Her hands swxmg to her even steps. He threw 
back his square shoulders, lifted his chin, and sniffed the 
motionless air. There was a flourish in the way he flicked 
the rump of the bull with the rope in his hand. He felt 
strong. He felt very strong. He felt that he could follow 
the slender, lithe figure ahead of him to the ends of the 
world.

and crack-brained articlet. I have no intention of changing the general 
policy of the Magazine. As I taid on the editorial page, I hope to 
continue, with the help of our writert, artists, readers, and advertisers, 
the publication of a truly Philippine magazine, devoted to Philippine 
interests — Philippine history, literature, art, and all the subdivisions 
of science at they apply to the Philippinet, Philippine industry and 
commerce (in a general way), and I hope to continue to write editorials 
on Philippine affiairs, truthfully and frankly, just as I, and I believe 
many others, see them, without, I trust, undue partisanship or bias. 
My general aim has been and will continue to be to publish a Magazine 
that does not compete with or duplicate any other local or foreign publi- 
cation, a Magazine that all may read, regardless of what other publica- 
tions they may subscribe to, certain that they will not find anything that 
they might just as well have read in some other publication. 

It is a pride of mine that the Magazine contains no syndicated 
material of any kind, no re-writes, no fillers, no write-ups in return for 
advertising. There is no regular reporterial staff; every article is 
written at first-hand and is authentic. The general policy is liberal, 
but not radical. More attention is paid to conditions than to personal- 
ities and easy praise is not given to everybody. The Magazine is 
frankly addressed to the more intelligent element in our population. 
It has set its own standards and will maintain them — so long as it has 
the backing of those it is trying to serve — the intelligent, thoughtful 
readers in this country. I hope that these readers will continue to 
support the Magazine — in fact, I am counting on it. And if they 
really feel kindly toward the Magazine, there are a few very helpful 
ways in showing this — getting their friends to subscribe, re-subscribing 
when their subscriptions expire, and paying their subscription accounts 
when these become due. Christmas is coming shortly and a very 
acceptable Christmas gift to almost anyone would be a subscription to 
the Philippine Magazine. We would send a Christmas card to your 
friend, telling him or her that the gift came from you. From now on, 
letters, subscription orders, subscription payments, etc., should be 
sent direct to the Philippine Magazine.
