Chronicle, a member of the com- 
mittee of U. S. newspaper edi- 
tors and publishers who flew to 
Europe at the invitation of Gen- 
eral Eisenhower to inspect 
German concentration camps, 
wrote the following story yes- 
terday; 

"An interesting feature of 
the inspection of Buehenwalde 
was seeing how Germany has 
deteriorated in character in 
27 years since the last war.*' 

I had been a prisoner of the 
Germans shortly before the last 
war ended, and by and large 
had been treated welL Food 
was poor but it also was food 
for the native population. 

"Hence I was somewhat du- 
bious of horror stories that had 
come out of Germany during 
the present war. Prison camps 
I was in in 1918 were hotels 
compared to conditions at Bueh- 
enwalde prison camps,"

Major Part of 
South Germany 

Paris — Two American and 
one French armies yesterday 
cleared all of Bavaria except a 
small area surrounding Hitler's 
mountain retreat near the Aus- 
trian border as the battle of 
Europe settled down to mop* 
ping up pockets of resistance in 
Holland, south Germany, and 
Czechoslovakia* 

British troops, advancing east 
of besieged Hamburg, still fur- 
ther compressed Nazi forces 
west of Berlin to an area less 
than 85 miles square. British 
forces were driving toward a 
new " junction with Russian 
armies, west and northwest of 
the burning German capital 

In Holland, the Canadian 
First Army advanced several 
miles, tightening its trap around 
Nazi divisions holding out in 
Hague and Rotterdam. 

Allied headquarters yester- 
day also reported American 
divisions . had penetrated 68 
miles into Austria, where they 
were near a juncture with the 
Russians. Admiral Nicholas

Forces Under MacArthur 
Hit Beach at Tarakan Isle 

Veteran Australian troops of the New Guinea and 
Middle East campaigns landed at two beachheads Mon- 
day on the key island of Tarakan off the east coast of 
Borneo, Gen, MacArthur announced today. 

The Australians encountered no serious opposition 
to the landings, and the upper column met little resist- 
ance in a drive northward toward the airfield, two miles 
from the landing point. The other column faced 
sporadic small arms fire as it headed inland toward the 
town of Tarakan and the nearby oilfield. 

The landings were preceded^- 
by two days of intense air at- 
tacks, Saturday and Sunday, by 
the American 13th Air Force 
nd the RAAF to neutralize Jap- 
anese airfields throughout the 
Celebes area to the south and 
east Cruisers and destroyers 
of the United States Seventh 
fleet and the Royal Australian 
navy shelled enemy positions on 
Tarakan for four days prior to 
the landing- The Japanese an' 
and naval forces made no at- 
tempt to counter the new blow, 
the communique said. 

Today's communique from 
Gen. MacArthur, under whose 
command troops of one of Aus- 
tralia's most famous divisions 
poured ashore on Tarakan 
pointed out that the new thrust 
challenges the enemy's posses- 
sion of the rich Borneo oil and 
rubber resources, which already 
have been denied Japan by the 
air and naval^blockade.^

gPITORtAL 

BAGUIO AND DAVAO 

The peculiarly sadistic savagery of the Japanese militarists 
Has been shown no more clearly than at Baguio. 

Here was a peaceful mountain resort, utterly without stra- 
tegic value to the Japanese once the Lingayen Gulf area had 
b'een secured by the American forces. And yet the Japanese 
decreed that it should be almost totally destroyed before it fell 
<nto American hands. 

Baguio was one of the main centers of pre-war activity in 
►he Philippines. Davao was the other. Baguio has already been 
'iterated. Judging from the fighting in Mindanao, it won't be 
long before the Japanese will be driven out of the city of Davao. 

When they have lost both of their main pre-war bases in 
toe Philippines, in addition to the cities and towns seized after 
Pearl Harbor, the Japanese hold on the Philippines will be almost 
lathing of the past. Only in the Cagayan Valley and in eastern. 
Mindanao will there be Japanese forces of any importance. 
rJiey, too, are doomed. 



6th Engineers Keep Busy 
On Luzon Battlefronts 

With Sixth Division, Luzon— The Sixth Engineer 
battalion has made an excellent record under enemy 
tire since S-Day, completing 15 miles of roads with 
drainage systems, one Bailey bridge, 60 culverts, 60 
niles of supply trails, two trestle bridges, and the 
strengthening of many others. 

In the process, the battalion also killed 61 Japs, 
destroyed 41 caves and pillboxes and cleared four mine- 

u ^fields. 

Eligibility for Civil - Th ? e ??[ ne ? rs Y ere especially

nquiry has been submitted 
yy the bureau of civil service to 
he office of the President as 
o whether the expiration period 
•r the eligibility of persons who 
tassed the civil service exami- 
nations in 1941 will be extend- 
•'i in view of the Japanese oc- 
cupation for three years. 

Sligibility, under the present 
<iw, would have expired after 
v year for those seeking em- 
ployment in Manila and two 
'ears for those in the provinces. 

As no decision has yet been 
endered on this question, the 
ivil service bureau has adopted 
he policy of certifying for ap- 
tointment such applicants whose 
eligibility did not expire on Dec- 
ember 31, 1941.

EDITORIAL 

BAGUIO AND DAVAO 

The peculiarly sadistic savagery of the Japanese militarists 
has been shown no more clearly than at Baguio, 

,Here was a peaceful mountain resort, utterly without stra- 
tegic value to the Japanese once the Ling a yen Gulf area had 
fie on secured by the American forces- And yet the Japanese 
decreed that It should be almost totally destroyed before it fell 
(uto American hands, 

Baguio was one of the main centers of pre-war activity in 
the Philippines. Davao was the other. Baguio has already been 
'iterated. Judging from the fighting in Mindanao, it won't be 
long before the Japanese wilt be driven out of the city of Davao, 

Whan they have lost both of their main pre-war bases in 
the Philippines, in addition to the cities and towns seized after 
r?earl Harbor, the Japanese hold on the Philippines writ be almost 
nothing of the past. Only in the Cagayan Valley and in eastern, 
Mindanao will there be Japanese forces of any importance, 
they, too, are doomed.

eligibility for Civil 
Service Questioned 

Inquiry has been submitted 
*Y the bureau of civil service to 
he office of the President as 
o whether the expiration period 
>i the eligibility of persons who 
iassed the civil service exami- 
nations in 1941 will be extend- 
*t in view of the Japanese oc- 
oipation for three years. 

Eligibility, under the present 
aw, would have expired after 
v year for those seeking em- 
ployment in Manila and two 
-«ars for those in the provinces. 

As no decision has yet been 
endered on this question, the 
ivii service bureau has adopted 
he policy of certifying for ap- 
pointment such applicants whose 
eligibility did not expire on Dec- 
ember SI, 1941. 

Cub Strings Wire

With Sixth Division East 
ip Manila — Captain William L, 
teller and his cub artillery 
observation plane took on a new 
ob a few days ago — establish- 
ag important telephone commu- 
tations between forces of the 
lixth Division. 

The Yanks needed communi- 
st ion lines between two peaks 
done* the Japs' Shimbu line hi 
he Sierra Madre mountains, 
m impassable 1500 foot gorge 
between the two peaks had the 
-ommunications experts stump- 
^1. Then Captain William 
Cellar and his cub plane flew 
*ver the gorge and reeled out 
<rire by hand. The plan worked 
tnd telephone service was soon 
festered. 



^fields 

The engineers were especially 
proud of the two-lane road they 
constructed in the Sierra Madre 
mountains. The route, over 
which Sixth division infantry- 
men received supplies while as- 
saulting the Shimbu line, was 
bulldozed across the mountains 
east of Marikina. Work crews 
often moved along abreast of 
advancing doughboys. 

The battalion, commanded by 
Lt, CoL Lawrence H. St, John 
of Indianapolis, dates back to 
the first engineer regiment or- 
ganized in 1846. It has parti- 
cipated in every war in which 
the United States has engaged,

Guerrilla Airfield on Bohol Named 
for First U. S. Flyer to Land There 

FIFTH AIRFORCE, Philippines— Steel airstrip is the 
official guerrilla name for an airfield on Bohol, most 
U ? the island of which was held by the guerrillas in 
Sree vears of fighting against the Japs. The American 
•lot for whom it was named — Kenneth Steel of the 
ff'fth Airforce — found it anything but steel when he 
r -st landed on it three months ago. He found himself 
f eling lucky when he walked from the plane. 
ie vpe \ was the first pilot to<^ 



i plane there since the 
fSricans left the Philippines 
^ S During the Leyte 
m h e was covering a 



convoy 



in a P-47 against a gas 



\«rwe and bad weather be- 
Shim and his base. 
C 1ms had told him that there 
oq an airstrip held by guer- 
S son Bohol. m Steel, finally 
und *e mysterious strip— and 
{ft it was covered with long 
rass. Nevertheless he came in 
L w a landing. - . 

The drag of the grass forced 
M plane to tip forward. It 
k died along on its propeller 
tinner, finally settling to an 
efn keel and stopping. Steel 
radioed pilots circling above 
him that he was safe, then turn- 
ed to meet a welcoming throng 
0 f Filipino guerrillas and 

civilians. m _ , 

Explanation for the. hazar- 
dous "strip" was that it was 
being built when the war began 
and the Filipinos had covered 
it with grass to conceal it from 
the Japs. For three years it 
waited. Then planes of the 348th 
sroup landed there whenever 
the weather prevented them 
from returning home. ^

Gen. Shoe Hit 
3 Times by Jap 
Machinegun Fire 

Bacolod, Negros Occidental 
— Brig. Gen. Robert O. Shoe, as- 
sistant commander of the 40th 
Division, was wounded three 
times by Jap machinegun fire 
and pinned on the ground for 
an hour while inspecting as- 
sault troops in action. He was 
hit once in the back of the neck 
and twice in the back. None 
of the wounds was serious, 
however. 

The general was observing 
an attack on Jap fortifications 
near Bacolod when the machine- 
gun opened up. The gun had 
been so cleverly concealed that 
infantrymen had overlooked it 
in the advance. 

It was more than three hours 
before the gun position was lo- 
cated and captured.

On OkinaW 



(/. S. t/mt$ Only 
2 Miles From 
Capital City 

Guam— Doughboys of the 96th 
Division yesterday drove within 
800 yards of Shuri, the island's 
former capital and second 
largest city while infantrymen 
of the 27th division fought 
across Machinato to within two 
miles of the Naha naval base. 

Lieut, General Simon Bolivar 
Buekner, Jr n commanding the 
10th Army in Okinawa, said hia 
troops are overcoming strong- 
enemy fortifications and meet- 
injr the heaviest artillery oppo- 
sition encountered anywhere in 
Pacific fighting. 

Buckner said that, despite Jap 
opposition from deep cave posi- 
tions, Americans have suffered 
less than one man hurt for 
every Japanese killed. 

The general also cited the 
failure* of Japanese strategy, 
laying their decision to with- 
draw from beachheads on land- 
ing day and make a stand on 
bo u thorn Okinawa was a "great 
break for us.' 1 The Jap with- 
drawal permitted Americans to 
Land heavy equipment and com- 
plete organization for the of ~ 
tensive, he said* 

Troops of the 24th Infantry 
division continued to advance 
Monday in the eastern sector of 
the Okhiawa lines and by after- 
noon advance elements of the 
division had entered the village 
of Knhazu. The attack of the 
doughboys was supported by 
heavy naval gunfire, heavy 
artillery and carrier- and land- 
based aircraft. 

One medium-sized American 
ship was damaged Monday by a 
few enemy planes attacking in 
the Okinawa area, and U. S. 
aircraft from escort carriers 
attacked air installations in the 
Sakashima group. 

Ammunition dumps were ex- 
ploded, facilities and barracks 
were hit, and several Jap planes 
destroyed on the ground in 
Sunday's strike on Sakashima 
by our escort carrier planes. 

I wo Jima-based fighters of 
the Seventh Fighter command, 
escorting B-29s over Tokyo, 
Monday, probably shot down 
one enemy plane and strafed 
small craft along the coast, des- 
troying one and leaving the 
others afire. 

Yesterday, Iwo-based Mus- 
tangs bombed and strafed mil- 
itary installations on Chichi 
Jima.

World Progress Is Theme 
In First Symphony Concert 



Beethoven's Third Symphony, 
which will open the first con- 
cert of the Manila Symphony 
Society in the ruins of Santa 
Cruz Church at 1 p,m« Wed- 
nesday, was originally dedicated 
to Napoleon. Beethoven looked 
upon him as the leader of 
a European revolution, "but 
when Napoleon declared himself 
Emperor the disillusioned com- 
poser tore off the title-page of 
the symphony, which had not 
yet been performed* 

He later wrote a new title- 
page dedicating the symphony 
to the memory of a great man. 
The great-spirited first move- 
ment is followed by a stately 
funeral march, This mood la 
shaken off, and the third move- 
ment is a rather hushed scherzo. 



The finale, developed in the 
form of variations, is one of the 
most remarkable compositions 
in this form. 

The second part of the open- 
ing program, which is dedicated 
"to the heroes of the United Na- 
tions," will include Dvorak's 
symphony, "Prom the New 
World", composed while he was 
In America. Large parts of the 
compositions are written around 
the Negro folksong, Wagon 
Wheels, Carry Me Home* 

The ruins of the old Santa 
Cruz Church, the main walls of 
which are still standing, will 
seat around 1,600 people. Re* 
served seat tickets are on sale 
at 1011 R. Hidalgo, at P10, P5, 
and P3, — from 9 to 12 and from 
3 to S o'clock daily, including

The formation of the commis- 



sion promises to be a highly 
constructive step in solving the 
present confused situation re- 
garding future Philippine trade, 
the paper said. 

Unlear Woodward, an F.E.A. 
official, vice president of the 
United States Commercial cor- 
poration, will probably head the 
commission. In addition to 
several economic experts, the 
Philippines mission will include 



at least one well-known foreign 
trader. 

The mission will be similar 
in purpose to the one composed 
of Washington officials and 
businessmen that visited French 
Africa and the Middle East last 
year to expedite private trade 
between the U. S. and those 
countries* 

With the Philippines still 
under military control of ship- 



ments to and from the islands, 
about the only exports from the 
Philippines have been hetop for 
military services. 

These were handled by the 
United States Commercial corp- 
oration at military request. The 
same agency also purchased es- 
sential goods which have been 
distributed in the islands by the 
armed forces.

Board Hearing 
Peace Requests 

Washington — An air 
route originating in Chica- 
go and terminating in Ma- 
nila was recommended to 
the U. S. Civil Aeronautics 
Board in Washington yes- 
terday by Merle P, Lyon, 
appointed to the board to 
represent the American 
public. 

Lyon, recommending that the 
board authorize Transcontinen- 
tal and Western Air, Inc, to 
provide the service, said inter- 
mediate stops between Chicago 
and Manila should be made at 
St, Paul, Minneapolis, Anchor- 
age, Alaska, Kurile islands, Tok- 
yo, Shanghai and Hong Kong or 
Canton. 

Lyon qualified his recommen- 
dations to point out that if 
Transcontinental and Western 
Airlines is granted the North 
Atlantic route, the Northwest 
Airlines should be the North 
Pacific carrier. He also recom- 
mended that Pan American 
Airways be permitted to extend 
its central Pacific route from 
Honolulu to Wake Island and 
that service should be establish- 
ed to either Hong Kong or Can- 
ton. 

The attorney alpo suggested 
that Pan American be allowed 
to extend its south Pacific route 
to Sydney and that Alaska air- 
lines' be permitted to fly a route 
from Noumea P New Caledonia, 
from Seattle to Anchorage.

Trieste Taken 

Rome — Fighting has ceased 
in northern Italy west of the 
Isonzo river, Allied headquar- 
ters announced Thursday fol- 
lowing the unconditional sur- 
render of all German troops in 
Italy and western and southern 
Austria. The announcement 
added: "There remain only the 
multitudinous details of assembl- 
ing and disarming scattered and 
disorganized remnants of the 
once proud Wermacht." 

Meanwhile, the New Zealand 
division occupied the important 
port of Trieste at the head of 
the Adriatic sea. Prior to the 
fall of the city, the Allied forces 
had taken more than 230,000 
prisoners in the Trieste corner 
of northeastern Italy. The 75th 
German army corps of the Li- 
gurian army laid down its arms 
in northwestern Italy in con- 
junction with the surrender of 
Italian components of the army 
by Marshal Graziani. The esti- 
mated million enemy troops 
made prisoner in the mass sur- 
render in Italy and much of 
Austria included remnants of 
22 German and six Italian Fas- 
cist divisions.

British troops entered the "open city" of Hamburg, third largest in Germany, and 
the Nazi high command declared Kiel and Flensburg "open cities," and Prague, th« 
capital of Czechoslovakia, a "hospital city" that will not be defended. 

British tanks slashed on northeast within 20 miles of Denmark, churning dve> 
roads strewn with bumed out hulks of 800 vehicles caught in a tornado of aerial 
bombardment. The British were last reported beyond Neumuenster, 16 miles 
south of Kiel running roughshod through all debris of a broken and beaten army.

Allied Planes Spike Great 
Nazi Sea Evacuation Attempt 



London — Germans at- 
tempting to flee the Reich 
by sea toward Denmark 
and Norway were thwarted 
yesterday by American, 
British and Canadian 
planes which sank or dam- 
aged more than 64 ships in 
day-long attacks off the 
Baltic coast of Schleswig- 
Holstein. 

Nazis set sail from all avail- 
able ports in every type of ship 
they could muster. They ranged 
from barges to 10,000 ton cargo 



ships, troop carriers and oven 
submarines. 

The U. S. Airforce rocket 
firing Thunderbolts and fighter 
bombers joined in the attacks 

which were started Thursday 
night by the RAF striking at 
the Kiel naval base. 

The shoreline near Kiel, Flens- 
burg and Luebeck was ablaze 
with burning ships. The water 
was full of German soldiers 
rowing lifeboats and even swim- 
ming toward shore where Bri- 
tish troops waited to capture 
them.

once, or should Laval refuse to 
l^ave, that he be locked up. 

Grew added that Generalis- 
simo Franco had already decided 
to take these measures, and 
Laval has now been interned by 
<he Spanish government in a 
fortress above Barcelona harbor.

Jween Tokyo and Nagoye with 45 



devastating hits, according to the 
Associated Press, which described 
it as one of the war's most spec- 
tacular aerial operations. 

The nine Saipan-based B-29s 
achieved almost unbelievable suc- 
cess when they se'ected the Shi- 
zuoka works as a secondary target 
after haze and instrument trouble 
prevented them from hitting their 



primary target. The lead plane 
planteJ its bombs squarely on the 
target and the eight following 
p'anes duplicated the feat. 

The B-29s were originally on their

THE NEED FOR UNITY STILL EXISTS 

The United States, ©reat Britain and Russia have achieved 
arllliant victories in Europe by maintaining unity. Every effort 
£y the Germans to destroy this unity has failed, including 
yimmler's peace offer to surrender unconditionally to Britain 
i£d the United States if Germany could continue to fight 
igainst Russia, , 

This same unity on the part of the United Nations means 
4e early defeat of Japan* Although Russia is not at war with 
Japan, Moscow has followed a steadily hardening line against 
Japan which has done little to enhance the peace of mind of 
(4)0 Tokyo militarists. 

There will, of course, be occasional differences between the 
United Nations.. But to see that this, basic unity continues at 
♦Jfie conference table after the war is a challenge to every citizen 
id - every freedom-loving nation. -

To carry out the program, CoL^ -

It was explained by CoL Hoi-

immediately after the battle of

Most of them were homeless 
waifa and orphans, whiles others 
were just hungry children 
whose only fault was in help- 
ing themselves to army rations 
without authority. 

First step in the rehabilita- 
tion program was to find homes 
for them. Then CoL Holland 
ordered the establishment erf 
playgrounds and clubs for boys, 
believing that under proper 
guidance and supervision, these 
under-privileged children could 
be turned into law-abiding 
citizens. 

With limited equipment avail- 
able, Col. Holland welcomes i the 
help and cooperation of civic- 
spirited individuals and organ- 
izations in the way of play- 
ground and club equipment.

In December, 1941, when it 
became apparent that Manila 
could not be defended, the or-

urgent problem at hand was to 
save the splendid new instru-

slovakia, and the library which 
contained all the major sym-

It was well-known by this

enough the former Conservatory

However, since Mrs. Valdes' 
home had been seized by Jap-

Sfon Runstedt Says U. S. Arpower 
Broke Germany's Chances in West 

With U. S. Seventh Army, Germany— Field Mar. 
i fen Karl Gerd Von Runstedt, Germany's top mil- 

• ir strategist taken prisoner by American troops, 
, Q Hvised of Hitler's death, said: "Admiral Doenits 

Seen in charge for some time." 

At General Patch's headquarters the cold, Prussian 
- tocrat expressed the greatest respect for American 

• ower. Runstedt said chaotic condition of heavily 
air bed French roads and rail lines around D-Day, par- 
^lirlv in the Paris area, prevented him from shifting 
5?£wps to counter attack^ 
h n r l aen. Ward H. Maris<^

ire was the greatest mistake 
^German high command 

n d Sdt replie d he could 
nnf A because he lacked the 
SJ&ve to evaluate the 
Campaign in its proper light. 

Maris observed that German 
artillery did not seem to meas- 
up " to the war days of 
1917-18: To this Runstedt 
replied: 

"We could not concentrate on 
;t Your airforce bombing of gun 
positions, highways and railways in 
Normandy and your naval bomb- 
ardment were troublesome. Some- 
times it came in as far as 25 miles 
around Caen. Mechanized war is 
not pretty," the prisoner philoso- 
phized. 

Although he was immaculate 

in a grey-green dress uniform, 

Von Runstedt apologized for 

his appearance. "It is my last 

uniform," he said. "Everything 

I had was destroyed last March 

when your airforce bombed my 

oommand post in Schloss Castle 

at Bad Nauheim.." 

The captured field marshal re- 
vealed he was relieved of his com- 
mand March I because of failing 
health. 

Dwelling on the German de- 
feat and his personal plight, 
Runstedt remarked in a low 

voice: 

"This is a painful experience 
for an old soldier."

Osmena "Welcomes" Possible Choice 
Of MacArthur as U. S. Envoy to P. L 

Washington— President Sergio Osmena of the Philippines Commonwealth 
Tuesday said that he would "welcome" the appointment of General Douglas 
MacArthur as first American ambassador to the Philippine Islands. 

The Filipino executive said that he thought the general would be "an ex- 
cellent choice" to return to the nation he helped liberate after his other war 
duties are completed. 

Osmena also disclosed that the Philippine government planned to take 
over Japanese-owned hemp producing lands near Davao on the island of Min- 
danao and divide it among Filipinos. 

He said: "We do not encourage the return of Japanese, especially if the 
land they lived on is essential to the defense of the Philippines." 

Osmena declared he would be "delighted" to encourage the reestablish- 
ment of American firms in the Philippines, adding, "we intend to help them 
in every possible way, including the matter of regulations."

Doenitz Directed Unsuccessful 
U-Boat Campaigns in Atlantic 

New York — Admiral Karl Doenitz, commander-in- 
chief of the German Navy who announced Hitler's death 
over the Hamburg Radio and proclaimed himself 
Hitler's successor, directed the unsuccessful German 
U-boat campaign against the Allied supply lines across 
the Atlantic. 



He is a professional navy of- 
ficer who commanded sub- 
marine warfare in the early 
part of the war, and was pro- 
moted in 1943 to commander of 
the fleet, succeeding Grand 
Admiral Erich Raeder. 

Shortly before the Allied land- 
ings in France, Doenitz, during 
a visit to the channel coast, told 
his U-boat commanders: "There 
is for U-boats only one word: 
When landing operations begin, 
charge the enemy and sink him." 

When the U. S. Navy helped 
slow up German attacks on 
British convoys in the Atlantic, 
Doenitz withdrew a large part 
of his submarine fleet into the 
Baltic, and emerged with a new 
offensive known to the Allies as 
'wolf packs" — submarines tra- 
velling in groups. This phase 
of the Nazi underseas offensive 
failed also, and by the middle 
of 1943, German U-boat attacks 
held only nuisance value.

GREW VERIFIES MZlTtACE OFFER SPURNEI 



Sat urday , May 5, 194 



Himmler Asked 4 
For Conference 
With Eisenhower 

Washington— Joseph C. 
Grew, acting Secretary of 
State, yesterday verified 
reports that Heinrich 
Himmler had offered Ger- 
man surrender. He made it 
clear that Himmler'a offer 
did not extend to Russia, 
and therefore was not ac- 
cepted by the United States 
and Great Britain. 

Grew declared Himmler had 
©aid that he hoped to be able to 
continue to fight on the eastern 
front and stipulated in his mes- 
sage from Lu check that his 
offer was for the western Al- 
lies only. 

At the time, General Schul- 
lenberg, Hitler's confidential 
staff officer, said Hitler could 
not live more than two days 
and that Himmter was to be in 
full authority. Himmler wanted 
to meet General Eisenhower to 
surrender the whole western 
front, 

According to Crew, the first 
overture by the Nasi Geetano 
was made the night of April 
23rd through the Swedish For- 
eign Office* President Truman, 
joint chiefs of staff and Acting 
Secretary Grew met the follow- 
ing dav and communicated with 
Churchill. 

Truman thm informed Stalin 
that the British and American 
governments proposed to renly 
that unconditional surrender 
must he made to all three Allies. 
Marshal Stalin pave his agree- 
ment to such a reply. 

Two days tater f the agreed 
reply to Himmler's offer was 
conveyed through the American 
legation in Stockholm. The 
American minister to Stockholm 
last Tuesdav reported that 
Count EemadoHe returned to 
Stockholm, advising that he had 
delivered Truman's message to 
Himmler but had received no 
reply,

"I am prepared to endorse and carry through to their conclusion the policies laid down 
by President Roosevelt respecting the island and the independence of the Filipino people." 

He said "the date of independence will b e advanced as soon as practicable," and express- 
ed belief that "suitable reciprocal trade" between the United States and the Philippines

Group "G", comprising the

Devers, ending all resist- 
ance from eastern Austria 
to the Swiss border. 

Gen. Devers, commanding the

seen the steady continuation of 
German demoralization and dis- 
integration on the western

rich Schurz, covered the south- 
ern German front from Linz to 
the Swiss border.

sides by radio broadcast are now 
announcing the ond of hostilities 
on their front so there may be no 
further loss of life."

TRUMAN'S SIGNIFICANT STATEMENT 

President Truman's statement on Philippine independence 
Js In line with the best traditions of American-Filipino relations* 
It Is conclusive proof, if proofs were needed, that the United 
States is determined to carry its great Philippine experiment in 
nation-building through to a successful conclusion. 

The processes by which a colonial people have been pre^ 
pared for independent nationhood were started by Gen. Arthur 
MacArthur, last American military governor of the PhiHppines. 
It is historically appropriate that these processes should be com- 
pleted under the friendly guidance of his son, Gen. Douglas 
MacArthur, who wi!J go down in history as probably the best 
friend the Filipino people ever had. 

The question of Philippine independence has been settled 
for many years. The only question left unsettled was whether 
the Americans would change Patrick Henry's plea by giving 
the Filipinos liberty and death. 

President Truman has answtered this question, by say- 
ing "The Philippine people, whose heroic and loyal stand in this 
war has won the affection and admiration of the American 
people, will be fully assisted by the United States in t he great 
problems of rehabilitation and reconstruction which he ahead, 
The President has also voiced the belief that "suitable reciprocal 
trade between the two countries should continue for such time, 
after independence, as may be necessary to prov.de the new 
republic with a fair opportunity to secure its economic free- 
dom and independence." 

For the Filipino people these pledges of American aid in 
reconstruction and a certain amount of free trade after the 
granting of independence hold forth the promise of an economi- 
cally sound foundation on which to build their republic. 

For the Americans, President Truman's pledges give assur- 
ance that there will be, here in the Philippines, a stable govern- 
ment, dedicated to democratic traditions and bound to the 
United States by ties of friendship and mutual Interest more 
enduring than the bonds of sovereignty. 



Philippine Delegation Submits 
5 Proposals to S. F. Conference 

San Francisco— The Philippine delegation to the 
United Nations security conference on Friday submitted 
five proposals of world import to the delegates of the 
rarious nations. The proposals were 

l_To widen th« power* off" 
the proposed world organisa- 
tion* general nfwembly* 

2 — To assure Western Asia 
and the western Pacific "com- 
munity aeats" on the security 
•ouncil along with other geo^ 
graphical *r«** °* ^ e ^ 0rld * 

3— To abolish the so-called 
vet* power of the fire major 
towers in security matters, and 
it the same time expand the 
power of imaller^ nations which 
are on the counciL 

4 — To provide that the inter- 
national" court should har* com- 
pulsory jurisdiction of disputes. 

5 — To define aggression and 
prohibit ieeret diplomacy. 

Other Philippine proposals 
would expand international or- 
ganizations in economic and cul- 
tural fields to include a goal of 
racial equality to achieve the in- 
ternational organization's objec- 
tives. 

Sponsoring amendments to 
the Dumbarton Oaks proposals, 
the Philippine delegation pro- 
posed that decisions of the Sec- 
urity Council, other than on per- 
sonal matters, should be made 
by an affirmative TOte of the 
majority of permanent members

such time, after independence, 
as may be necessary to provide 
the new republic with a fair 
opportunity to secure its econo- 
mic freedom and independence 
—a permanent blessing for the 
patriotic people of the Philip- 
pines. 

To assist me in the attain- 
ment of these objectives and 
with the concurrence of Presi- 
dent Osmefia, I am asking Sen. 
Millard Tydings of Maryland, 
chairman of the Filipino Reha- 
bilitation Commission, to Pro- 
ceed to Manila as my special 
envoy to examine conditions 
there and report his recom- 
mendations to me. 

"I have also designated the 
following- to accompany Sen. 
Tydings and to assist him in 
the accomplishment of this mis- 
sion." 

"Vice Admiral W. T. Tarrant, 
U.S. Navy; Brig. Gen. Prank 
E, Lowe, U.S. Army; Col. Ju- 
lian Baumann, U* S. Army ; 
George E. Ames, veterans ad- 
ministrator ; E. D. Hester, In- 
terior Department; J. Weldon 
Jones, bureau of budget; Ben 
D. Dorfman, U.S. tariff com- 
mission; Daniel S. Brierley, 
U.S. maritime commission; and 
C. H* Matthieson, consultant of 
War Production Board, 

"It will be my constant en- 
deavor to be of asistance to the 
Philippines. I will be only too 
happy to see to it that the close 
friendship between our two 
peoples develop through many 
years of fruitful association, is 
maintained and strengthened." 

Washington— President Os- 
mena issued the following com- 
ment on President Truman'fi 
statement : 

"The statement of President 
Truman in regard to the poli- 
tical and economic future of 
the Philippines is certain to re- 
ceive warm response from thm 
Filipino people. 

"I am deeply moved by Presi- 
dent Truman's understanding of 
the needs, hopes, and aspira- 
tions of the people whom I 
serve. President Truman i s 
bringing into their logical frui- 
tion those policies initiated 
under his illustrious friend 
and predecessor, the late Presi- 
dent Roosevelt. The presence 
of Senator Millard Tydings of 
Maryland and those who will 
accompany him on his presiden- 
tial mission to the Philippines 
will be welcomed by all Fili^ 
pinos, 

"In this war, both the Ameri- 
can and Filipino people have 
fought for their homeland. It i s 
my heartfelt prayer that this 
brotherhood of the battlefield 
will bring our common enemv 
down to swift defeat, and that 
these bonds of friendship— 
forged in a mutual cause— will 
endure and grow in the coming 
years of peace. 1 * *

-These institutions » he said, 
"require thorough 
and most of them, if not all, 
need rehabilitation, before they 
can achieve the sound and 
healthy condition required by 

law." „ . , , 

He added that President 
Sergio Osmefia expedited open- 
ing of a government bank to 
cover the emergency period 
until private banks can meet 
the requirements. 

The Secretary pointed out 
that the activities of the Bank- 
ing Division should not be con- 
fused with rehabilitation and 
relief work of the government, 
as its function is merely to pro- 
vide temporary banking and 
loan facilities so that agricul- 
tural,, industrial and commer- 
cial activities may be assisted 
on a short term basis. 

Loans for rehabilitation of 
agriculture and industry and 
rebuilding of destroyed proper- 
ties are not included in the 
scope of this new bank, accord- 
ing to Secretary Reyes. Such 
loans will be handled by institu- 
tions to be created by legislation 
based on recommendations of 
the Filipino Rehabilitation com- 
mission.

Casey compared Manila's 
astonishing strides in restoring 
dock facilities to the port of 
New York, where but three 
times the latter figure is reach- 
ed with all that city's transpor-

The general paid a tribute to

Gen. Casey Says Daily Supply 
Should Last Until Rainy Season 

"There ia no basic fear that Manila's 25,000,000 
gallons of daily water supply should not last until the 
rainy season commences, "Maj, Gen, Hugh J, Casey, 
Chief Engineer, GHQ, Southwest Pacific Area said yes- 
terday. ■ 

He added "the system can be repaired by June for 
the next rainy season/' 

Casey said "the source of supply was there and 
that only necessary repairs were needed to entirely solve 
Manila's water problem. He disclosed that the repair 
job was "not a major undertaking," and that 60 percent 
of the city's water system had b een restored, 

Various needful jobs. , 

However, private repair work 
and construction by civilians is 
a disturbing trend, Casey said. 
Civilians refurnishing homes, 
opening- stores and night clubs

prices. The result is a loss of 
potential army labor to the black 
market.

Bradley Pins Medal on Konev 
In Historic Meet Near Berlin 



At a Russian Command 
Post Outside Berlin — The 
commanders of two great Allied 
armies, which played leading 
roles in the destruction of 
Hitler's fortress from east and 
west, met Saturday for the first 
time outside Berlin, Lee Carson, 
International News Service cor- 
respondent revealed yesterday. 

The two commanders were 
Gen. Omar Bradley, heading the 
U. S. 12th Army group, and 
Marshal Ivan S. Konev, Soviet 
commander of the First Ukrai- 
nian Army. Bradley presented 
the Red Army marshal with the 
American Legion of Merit 
medal, "in the name of the sol- 
diers and citizens of the U. S. 




GEN. OMAR BRADLEY 



Konev, accepting the decora- 
tion, said: "I accept this medal 
not as a personal honor but as 
a symbol of the result of Ameri- 
can and Russian armies working 
together, 

"I am proud for our men and 
for the Soviet Union which has 
long awaited this moment of 
handclasp on the battlefield and 
which is symbolic of the future 
of our two great nations." 

The historic meeting of the 
two generals took place at an 
elaborate vijla outside Berlin 
which had been captured by the 
Russians. 

Both Bradley and Konev fell 
into easy conversation although 
they had to rely on interpreters. 



Osmefia Stresses 
Need for Future 
Trade With U.S. 

NEW YORK— President 
Sergio Osmena said yes- 
terday the economic stabil-

the Philippines depended 
upon future trade rela- 
tions with the United 
States, in a message read 
at ceremonies here com- 
memorating the third anni- 
versary of the fall of Cor- 

regidor. 

The message, read by Secre- 
tary of Finance Jaime Hernan- 
dez, emphasized that unless 
trade relations were suitably 
arranged "it will be extremely 
difficult for the Philippines 
during the initial period of its 
existence to attain that degree 
of economic stability essential

Allies Slash Across Tarakan, 
Clear Hills East of Oilfields 



Pilsen, Czech Arsenal City 

PARIS— General Patten's American Third 
Army, closing in for the kill, hurled at least 10 
infantry and armored divisions into the Battle 
of Czechoslovakia today, seizing the great muni- 
tions city of Pilsen, which carried the Americans 
45 miles inside Czechoslovakia. 

The U. S. Third Army was ''disorganizing 
the last German Army offering resistance on the 
Western Front," Supreme Allied headquarters 
announced. 

Simultaneously, the U. S. Fifth Army from 
Italy invaded southern Austria at two points, ap- 
plying pressure from the south, while Patton's 

^men struck along a 175 mile 
front from Eger in north- 



- Australian and Indone- 
sian forces, after clearing 
high ground east of the 
main Pamoesian oilfield, 
advanced across Tarakan 
Island to within one and 
one-half miles of the east- 
ern shore, today's com- 
munique from General Mac- 
Arthur's headquarters an- 
nounced. 

Fighting was still in progress 
in Tarakan City off Borneo, 
with Allied air and sea forces 
providing support for the 
ground action. The communique 
revealed the Tarakan airfield 
was already in operation. 

On Borneo itself, heavy bomb- 
ers swept the Keningau air- 
drome, northeast of Brunei Bay 
naval base, as other formations 
left fuel depots, shipyards, and 
one-half square mile of the 
warehouse area in flames at 
Miri and along the west coast. 

On Mindanao troops of the 
24th Division assaulted enemy 
position in the hills west of Da- 
vao, as 31st Division in the 
central sector advanced another 
eight miles toward the Mara- 
mag airfield. 1 

On Luzon, patrols reached the 
edge of the highway leading 
over Balete Pass. Another 
smashing air strike saw 285 
tons of bombs unloaded on 
enemy troops and communica- 
tions in the Cagayan. 

Air attacks also continued on 
Formosa, the China Sea, and 
along the China coast. 



Tokyo Vilifies Nazis for Peace Offers; 
Charges H'mmler Violated Axis Pact 

TOKYO — Japanese Foreign Minister Togo branded Heinrich Himmler's 
unconditional surrender offers to British and Americans as "a flagrant 
transgression of the tri-party pact which rules out any unilateral -peace ar- 
rangements". 

"Under these circumstances," Togo said "Japan reserves the freedom 
to re-examine all her relations with the German Reich." 

Togo, speaking in English over the Tokyo radio, also said that the un- 
conditional surrender offer made by Himmler, commander of the Reich's 
Reserve forces and assumption of the Reich's chancellorship by Admiral 
Doenitz has made it clear that Germany intends to come to terms with the 
United States and Britain while continuing war with the Soviet Union." 

The Japanese foreign minister also complained that the Himmler 
offer "not only constitutes violation of the tri-party pact between Japan, 
Germany and Italy, but does not identify with avowed war aims in Japan 
which is at war with the British and American nations but is strictly bound 
in neutrality with the Soviet Union."

One Third Army column was

Pilsen had traveled 16 miles in 
the early morning and had the 
city of more than 100,000 mop- 
ped up by noon. Another column 
turned up on the Otava River 
50 miles southeast of Pilsen. 

Guns were silent elsewhere 
on both the northern and south- 
ern fronts. 

All hostilities ceased at 8 a*rn 
Saturday (3 p.nv Manila time) 
in northwest Germany, Holland, 
Denmark, the Frisian islands, 
and Heligoland, Supreme Allied 
headquarters revealed. 

The cessation of fighting was 
in accordance with the uncondi- 
tional surrender of all German 
armed forces in the area, signed 
by the German high command 
Friday night at Field Marshal 
Montgomery's headquarters.

House Members Split on Question 
Of Organization in Absence of Osmena 



The 64 members of the Com- 
monwealth House of Represen- 
tatives now in Manila are 
sharply divided on the question 
of organization in the absence 
of President Sergio Osmena, 
who is now in the United States. 
This was disclosed yesterday 
when Congressman Jose Zulue- 
ta, of Iloilo, called a meeting 
of all congressmen now in the 
city to discuss the plans for 
immediate organization. 

Forty-one congressmen, ac- 
cording to Emilio de la Paz, re- 



presentative from Rizal, refused 
to attend the meeting. In a con- 
ference held last Saturday, the 
41 house members approved a 
resolution, declaring "for the 
sake of national harmony and 
for the welfare of the country 
as a whole" that the Philippines 
Congress remain in recess 
"until such time as President 
Osmena shall have returned to 
Manila and personally report 
on his mission in the United 
States." 

The resolution pointed out 
that the President now is in the 



U. S. for securing definite com- 
mitments on rehabilitation of 
the Philippines, on advancement 
of the date of independence and 
on favorable economic conces- 
sions in trade relations between 
the U. S. and the Philippines 
after independence. 

Noting that "conditions fac- 
ing the people of this country 
are grave," the resolution re- 
emphasized President Osmena's 
pledge on February 27 that he 
'"would call the Congress of the 
Philippines to a special ses- 
sion at the first opportunity;"

THE RAINS ARE COMING 

The United S+ates Army fights on many fronts. In ffi 
Phmpptnes, today, one of its main fronts is the weather. 

Within a few weeks the rainy season will set in. If the 
esteros aren't cleaned out, the rivers dredged, and the sewers 
put back mto operation by then, the city of Manila will be 
in a desperate condition. 

Fortunately, American Army engineers have foreseen the 
problem. Maj. Gen, Hugh Casey, chief engineer, and his as- 
sistants are doing everything that engineering genius, modern 
equipment and intelligent planning can do. 

But the people of Manila will have to do their part in this 
great task. No one knows better than the Filipinos how un- 
pleasant a rainy season can be. The people must get their 
houses in order, repair leafcy roofs, and above all volunteer their 
services in the sheer physical job of cleaning up the ruins left 
behind by the Japs.

Emergency Notes 
Okay in Negros 
For Tax Payment 

Emergency notes, issued by 
the Commonwealth government 
of Negros under Governor Al- 
fredo Montelibano during Jap- 
anese occupation, are being ac- 
cepted by the provincial govern- 
ment in payment of taxes, ac- 
cording to Rieardo Montelibano 
who has just arrived in the city 
from Negros. 

The Commonwealth govern- 
ment moved from the mountains 
to the city and towns of the 
island upon its liberation with- 
out mishap. Most of the food 
had been produced during the 
campaign initiated by the gov- 
ernor last year, while the Jap- 
anese still held coastlines and 
towns of the island. The PC AU 
has brought in a small supply 
and is concentrating mainly on 
the transportation and distri- 
bution of food from one area to 
another. 

Mayor of ^ Bacolod City is 
Aurelio Locsin who served as 
deputy governor with Monteli- 
bano during occupation. Ba- 
colod is intact save for a few 
blocks which the Japanese were 
able to burn before withdraw- 
ing. An estimated 15.000 Jap- 
anese are believed still folding 
out in the mountains of Silay 
where American artillery and 
tanks are eliminating them.

Washington — Philippine 
Commonwealth President 
Sergio Osmena yesterday 
spoke glowingly of his eldest 
son, Doctor Emilio Osmena, 
who refused to pledge alle- 
giance to the Japanese, "I 
am very proud of that boy," 
Osmena remarked. 

Osmena said that after re- 
fusing to collaborate with 
the enemy, Emilio, then 
serving with the Filipino 
army on Cebu, was taken 
away by the Japanese and 
has not been heard from 
since. 

The Philippine President 
said that Kmilio might be^a 
Japanese prisoner but was 
more likely to have been, 
executed. 

Osmena said that another 
son, Jose Osmena, is still 
missing on Cebu and that he 
has no idea what happened to 
him. 

Two other sons, Ramon and 
Victor, are at school in the 
United States.

i 2 Fo 



i Of Others Freed by Americans 

London — Former French Premiers Edouard 
Daladier and Paul Reynaud and Gens. Maurice 
Gamelin and Maxime Weygand were freed from 
months of German political imprisonment Sunday, 
when two battalions of the 36th "Texas" Division 
fought their way into Itter Castle, Itter, Austria, 
\ while other Allied forces were liberating 130 high 
; ranking hostages near the Brenner Pass. 
; Included in the latter were former Austrian 
\ Chancellor Kurt Von Schuschnigg, his wife and 
* t'our-vear-old son born in captivity, former French 
! Premier Leon Blum and German Pastor Martin 
\ Niemoeller. 

Also liberated at Itter were Leon Jouhaux, 
head of French trade unions; Madame Weygand; 
General Charles De Gaulle's brother-in-law and 
sister-in-law; Michel Clemenceau, son of the World 
War I French Premier ; Colonel Francois De La 
Hocque, head of the French Socialists; and Jean 
Borotra, Basque tennis player. 

Both Niemoeller and Schuschnigg at first stood 
with the Nazis, but both learned in prison camps 
that Hitler and his accomplices would not tolerate 
independence of thought and action. , 

Niemoeller, the Lutheran pastor joined ^the 
Nazi party for a short time but would not accede 
to interference of the Nazi paiiy with his ; church. 
He was arrested in 1937 and remained a prisonei

With Sixth Army Group Outside Munich— Gen- 
eral Jacob L. Devers, who accepted the surrender of 
the German First and 19th armies Sunday, said this 
victory would be "heartening to our armies and navies 
in the Pacific and that in time it would bring them 
substantial aid." 

Devers signed the historic surrender document with 
one foot resting nonchalantly on a chair on the estate of 
Hitler's favorite sculptor, Prof. Thorak, 10 miles east 

f of Munich. 

His light-hearted attitude was 
in sharp contrast to the glum 
faces of the Germans, headed 
by Lt. General Hermann Foer- 
tsch, commander of the German 
First Army. 

The Germans saluted stiffly 
as they entered, but the Ameri- 
cans neither rose nor returned 
the salute. 

Devers, in opening the discus- 
sion, said: "It is understood that 
this is unconditional surrender/' 
and Foertsch nodded. 

During the negotiations, the 
Germans marked maps with 
blue pencils to show their lines 
and the disposition of their 
troops. 

They admitted their forces 
were in terrible confusion as a 
result of the lightning American 
advance. The Germans did not 
know for certain what divisions 
or how many troops they had or 
where they were. 
' After the surrender, Devers 
paid tribute to the troops of 
the Sixth Army group which, 
he said, "fought their way 
through France and Qermany, 
approximately 900 road miles, to 
take a large part in achieving 
this momentous victory." 



Schools Reopen 
In Zamboanga 

All public schools in Zam- 
boanga have been opened 
through U. S. Army assistance, 
according to Commissioner 
Teopisto Guingona for Minda- 
nao and Sulu. The PCAU unit 
stationed in Zamboanga has also 
reopened hospitals and dis T 
pensaries in that province as 
well as in the Sulu Archipe- 
lago. 

There is no food shortage in 
Mindanao and there is no pos- 
sibility of any such crisis in 
the future, Guingona added. In 
every province in Mindanao, 
rice, corn and cassava are 
plentiful.^ Clothing is the main 
need.

ing soldiers in Bataan and Cor- 
regidor. He made two success- 
ful round trips fully loaded with 
supplies. 

On his third return trip to 
Corregidor, he was spotted by 
a large enemy naval force. To 
avoid falling into the hands of 
the enemy, Capt. Amoyo 
scuttled, beached and burned 
the Legaspi off Escarceo light- 
house in Mindoro. By his action, 
no cargo fell to the enemy.

U. S. Delegation Submits 3 Major 
Changes to Dumbarton Oaks Plan 



Private Group 
Supports Free 
Trade Measure 

New York — Eugene P. 
Thomas, president of the Na- 
tional Foreign Trade Council, 
a private group , Saturday an- 
nounced the council's support 
of the Doughton bill to renew 
& nd strengthen the Reciprocal 
Trade Agreements Act. 

Thomas declared: "This en- 
dorsement by the council re- 
flects the attitude toward the 
Dough ton bill of many elements 
of American business which are 
concerned with the healthy dev- 
elopment of our foreign trade* 

"These include numerous 
manufacturers, agricultural in- 
terests, surface and air trans- 
portation companies, hanks and 
insurance companies," 

Revitalization of the recipro- 
cal trade agreements program 
would vitally aid the mainten- 
ance of high employment in this 
country, as well as economic 
well-being and peace beyond its 
borders, Thomas asserted, 

Mirny countries of the world 
are looking to the United 
States for economic and poli- 
tical leadership at this time, 
Thomas said.

SAN FEANCISCO — U. S. Secretary of State Edward 
R ( Stettinius, chairman of the American delegation to 
the United Nations world conference, yesterday pro- 
posed three American amendments to the proposed Dum- 
barton Oaks plan for world organization. 

The American proposals were separate and distinct 
from a number of other changes submitted jointly by 
the tL S. f Great Britain, the Soviet Union and China 

If adopted, the American pro-® 
posals would: 

1 — Clarify the power* of the 
proposed world organization'* 
general assembly* 

2 — Clarify the power* of the 
proposed world organization'* 
security council "in regard to 
regional arrangements directed 
against present AxU powers/' 

3— Set up & United Nations 
system of trusteeship for de- 
pendent territories. 

Stettinius said the U- S- dele- 
gation plans to -hold "further 
consultations*' with other dele- 
gates on the proposed American 
amendments, and confirmed 
they had been given "varying 
decrees" of support from Great 
Britain, Russia and China, 

Explaining the first two pro- 
posals, Stettinius said: 

"One of these amendments 
would clarify the power of the 
assembly to recommend mea- 
sures for the peaceful' adjust- 
ment of any situation regardless 
of origin likely to impair the 
general welfare or friendly re- 
lations including situations re- 
sulting from the violation of 
purposes and principles of the 
proposed cartel of world organ- 
ization. 

"A second amendment clari- 
fies authority of the Security 
Council in regard to regional 
arrangements directed against 
the present Axis powers. It re- 
emphasizes that no enforcement 
action would he taken under 
regional arrangements without 
the authority of the Security 
Council, except when such action 
was directed against states now 
at war with the United Na- 
tions,"

Aussies Take 
Japs' Tarakan 
Headquarters 

Australian forces on Borneo's 
key island of Tarakan enlarged 
their gains to the north and 
ea^t of Tarakan city and cap- 
tured the enemy's hurriedly 
evacuated headquarters, Gen- 
eral MacArthur announced 
today. 

Strong patrols cleared the 
enemy from the vicinity of the 
airfield and were operating in 
the broken country to the north. 
Medium and fighter bombers 
throughout the day bombed and 
strafed enemy gun positions 
and pillboxes. 

Other bombers hit Ranau 
and Bintulu runways in west 
Borneo and destroyed planes on 
fhe Labuan airdrome while air 
and naval patrols destroyed 
five vessels. 

In Mindanao, American forces 
chased Japanese columns into 
the hill country while reduc- 
tion of enemy pockets continued 
in both the northern and central 
Luzon sectors. 

The air assault on Formosa 
was maintained with 300 tops 
of explosives falling on air- 
bases, factories, rail installa- 
tions and warehouses from 
Keelung in the north to Koshun 
in the south. Numerous fires 
were started with smoke rising 
7,000 feet. 



2 German Cruisers 
Surrender to Allies 

Stockholm— The 10,000 ton 
cruisers Prinz Eugen and Sey- 
dlitz, together with the light 
cruiser Nuernberg, and 160,000 
tons of merchant shipping were 
sported to have been surrender- 
ed to the Allies at Copenhagen, 
Denmark yesterday. 

Admiral Doenitz ordered all 
U-boats to cease operations, 
telling them "continuation of tne 
struggle is impossible*' 



Mac Arthur Leads 
Manila Tribute 
To Nazi Defeat 

Manilans celebrated yes- 
terday as news spread 
through the city that the 
war in Europe was over. 
Army and Commonwealth 
officials, led by General 
Douglas MacArthur paid 
tribute to Allied armies in 
Europe and underscored 
the significance of this 
event to the peoples of the 
Pacific. 

General MacArthur, in a 
broadcast message to the Unit- 
ed States, said last night: 

"I rejoice with you in the 
triumph of Allied arms which 
has restored human liberty to 
the enslaved peoples of Europe." 

He emphasized that "this 
command, presently engaging 
our remaining enemy on many 
fronts, will now be reinforced 
by thoSe vast and powerful re- 
sources of war heretofore em- 
ployed on the battlefields of 
Europe," and added: 

"Through this additional 
strength, the Japanese empire 
will be the more speedily van- 
quished with greater economy of 
American and Allied life than 
otherwise would be possible. 
(The text of General Mac- 
Arthur's statement may be 
found on page 6). 

In the streets of Manila, peo- 
ple who read the "Free Philip- 
vines Extra" shouted with joy. 
The Free Philippines hit the 
streets at 11:20 Monday night 
iust 31 minutes after the first 
flash from Rheims, France was 
received in the newsroom. 

Almost all the thirteen local 
papers issued "Extras" report- 
rg the end of the war in Europe. 
In the crowded corridors of 
Malacanan, newsboys were 
swamped and all copies were 
sold in a few minutes.

Capitulation Document 
Will Be Signed in Berlin 

SAN FRANCISCO— President Harry Truman officially proclaimed Germany's 
unconditional surrender at 1300 G.M.T. yesterday, (10 p.m. last night, Manila 
time) and named Sunday, May 13, as a "day of prayer." 

The President, declaring that "the flags of freedom fly all over Europe," 
called it a "solemn but glorious hour," and expressed regret that President Roose- 
velt had not lived "to see this day," 

Simultaneously from London, Prime Minister Chur- 
chill declared that the unconditional surrender of Ger- 
many "will be ratified and confirmed in Berlin'] and that 
hostilities would cease one minute after midnight Brit- 
ish time (7 a.m. Tuesday, Manila time). 

Churchill said "today this agreement will be rati- 
fied and confirmed at Berlin where Air Chief Marshal 
Tedder, deputy supreme commander and General Tas- 
signy will sign on behalf of General Eisenhower." 

He revealed that the Germans were "still in places 
resisting the Russians" but added that if resistance 
continued after midnight, "they will, of course, deprive 
themselves of protection of the laws of the war and 
$>will be attacked from all quar- 
ters by Allied troops." 




President Truman 



Doenitz Says Cease 
Fight Order Given 

LONDON — Admiral Karl Doenitz, in a broadcast 
from Flensburg yesterday, said all German resistance 
would cease at 11 p.m. German time (7 a.m. Tuesday, 
Manila time). 

Admiral Doenitz said : 

"When I took over from the fuehrer, I took it as 
my first task to save the life of the German people. 
Therefore, during the night of May 6-7, 1 gave the order 
for unconditional surrender. 

"On May 8, all arms have been laid down. We bow 
before the sacrifices of our nation, of its fighting army, 
and of all men who have been killed. It was impossible 
to carry on this struggle. A very difficult path lies 
before us. 

"The German soldiers of countless battles now are 
treading the bitter path to captivity." 

Doenitz, who assumed command of Germany fol- 
lowing: Hitler's death last week, declared he did not 
know whether he would continue at his post. | 



Churchill further revealed 
that German capitulation 
occurred at General Eisenho- 
wer's headquarters at Rheims at

TTSUP TO THE JAPANESE 

Never has the inadequacy of Japanese leadership been so 
clearly demonstrated as In the collapse of the German armies 
bringing an end to the war in Europe. When Top plunged 
Japan into war with the United States, he figured that the pre- 
occupation of the democratic nations with Europe would pre- 
clude their being able to strike back at Japan* 

But the Japanese leaders made the worst mistake in their 
nation's history. Their inability to size up the situation and act 
accordingly destined Japan for the first complete military de- 
feat in her history. 

The Japanese people are paying a terrible price for the 
blunders of their leaders. The great cities of Japan are being 
pounded slowly into ruins* American forces stand at the thres- 
hold of Japan proper, and an invasion of the homeland appears 
a certainty. 

How long they will continue to suffer for the bad judg- 
ment of their leaders is up to the Japanese people. They can 
have an honorable peace as soon as they throw out the leader- 
ship that has brought them to the brink of annihilation* The 
decision lies with them,

Manila— Tarakan, Borneo, where Austr'aj 
troops are now fighting with American air and np 
support, probably can be placed m production in « 
to furnish large quantities of fuel for the final dt 
against the Japanese, according to Maj. Gen. IW 
Casey, Chief; U. S. Army Engineers in the South,. 
.Pacific* 

Although equipment has been to some extent,; 
troyed, Gen. Casey said probably no permanent ); v 
has been done. The work of restoring oil produ^ 
will be handled by Netherlands engineers who 
just behind Australian tro ops with Amer ican L : 
Lease equipment. 

The rc-dcvelopment of Tara- 
kan Field off east Borneo is 
potentially of great importance 
to the Allied war effort* Tara- 
kan was one of the three great 
fields of Borneo and produced 
.some of the world's finest fuel 

01 Oil from some of these wells 
was even pumped into tankers 
without refining with high qual- 
ity military fuel to serve as an 
equalizer* . - - 

Tarakan consists entirely o± 
shallow wells, with oil', deposits 
lying only a few feet below sea 
love], Casey explained, adding 
that no matter how much the 
Japs have done to destroy the 

shafts it should be a fairly 

quick matter to sink new wells 

on sites of the old ones- 
Extraction of a quantity of 

fuel from Tarakan would be of 

considerable value to the Allies. 

Casey pointed out It would 

nrovide relief for the diminish- 

ment of present sources, relieve 

the strain on Allied shipping 

feeding the war machine in the 

Southwest Pacific. 

Virtually all oil and gasoline 

used in planes and shins of the 

Americans, British, Netherlands 

and Australian commands have 

been hauled long distances in 

tankers* Casey observed. He 

said (that tlie source of fuel 

Hose to the front therefore 

would be of great value.

ing force in the history of the 
world from Europe to Asia re- 
cently were announced by Sec. 
of War Henry L. Stimson, Gen. 
George C. Marshall, Army chief 
of Staff, and Gen. Brehon 
Somervell, commanding' general 
of Army Service Forces.. 

Stimson on Feb. 28, 1945 said 
when hostilities cease in Europe, 
'the War Department intends 
to marshal against 
Japan, every soldier and 
every item of equipment 
that can be used effec- 
tively to speed our final 
victory." 

Gen. Marshall, in an 
Army Day address last 
April emphasized there 
would be no pause after 
the defeat of Germany. 
He said : "For more than 
a year, the War Depart- 
ment has been working 
on plans for this trans- 
fer which constitutes, I 
believe, the greatest 
problem in administra- 
tion and logistics in 
history. We have con- 
stantly kept our plans up 
to date. We have been 
prepared to put them 
into action, literally on 
an hour's notice, when- 
ever that hour strikes." 

Gen. Marshall said at the very 
moment hostilities cease in Eu- 
rope it "is imperative we start 
movement through the Suez and 
through the Panama Canal of 
units needed in the highest 
priority for acceleration of the 
campaign in the Pacific." 

The War Department's plan 
for re-deployment of troops and 
supplies from Europe to the 
Pacific include the following 
j three phases: 

I One — Shifting of men and 



supplies direct from Europe to 
the Pacific. Active units need- 
ed against Japan will be 
shipped to the Pacific from 
Europe while the majority of 
ships proceeding to Europe will 
continue on to the Pacific with 
very few returning to the U. S. 

Two — The return of sur- 
plus men and equipment to the 
United States. Some of the men 



Gen. Somervell said on April 
17 the re-deployment procedure 
has been speeded up by four 
months as the result of improv- 
ing transfer procedures. One 
method, he said, was by convert- 
ing a number of large, fast car- 
go ships into combination cargo 
and troop carriers. Each man 
transferred to the Pacific will 
require five ship-tons of sup- 




Lincd up at navy depot are hundreds of small tractors, used on 
fifth ting fronts to move supplies along beachheads. Tins is only 
a small part of vast supply system built up by A 
for ivar of movement. 



will be given further training 
for /Pacific service and some 
of the equipment will be recon- 
ditioned for use in the Pacific. 

Three — Shipment of food and 
supplies to liberated areas to 
feed liberated peoples and to re- 
habilitate their industries and 
services.

. . -7/ 7,„W7 e trans-shipment of men and supplies from Europe to the Pacific. 
France, which unit mnai 



plies for the move and one ship- 
ton every month to keep him 
in the Pacific. 

Liberty ships require 2^ 
months longer to make the trip 
from Europe than fast trans- 
port ships, and the movement 
of troops and supplies must be 
coordinated so they will' arrive 
at their destination at the same 
time. It requires 15 liberty 
ships to move the equipment of 
one U.S. Army division, in addi- 
tion to the varying number of 
transport vessels to carry the 
more than 10,000 men in each 
division. 

Gen. Somervell said about 70 
per cent of the supplies* in Eu- 
rope can be transferred. This 
is a weighted average and does 
not apply to all equipment. 
Thus, only about 10 percent of 
field wire, for instance, can be 
recovered, but almost all of cer- 
tain radar devices and heavy 
artillery pieces can be used. 

The transfer of weapons from 
Europe entails a problem of 
readying equipment for the Pa- 
cific front. Differences in bat- 
tle and climatic conditions be- 
tween the two theaters require 
vast modifications. The rate of 
deterioration in trorycal and 
sub-tropical areas of the Pacific 
is much higher than in Europe. 
Corrosion and fungi do almost 
as much damage as the enemy. 

Gen. Marshall emphasized the 
necessity of sending increasing 
supplies to liberated European 
areas in his Army Day speech, 
saying, "to a constantly increas- 
ing degree, we shall have urgent 
requirements for food to feed 
the starving in the Netherlands 
and to meet the stark necessi- 
ties of other occupied areas, de- 
mands for raw materials to get 
factories going, and to put rest- 
less and poverty stricken men 
to work."

Victory In Europe 
Tribute To Records 
In Output of Arms 

Washington — The end "of the war 
in Europe brings to a close the first 
chapter of America's mightiest mil- 
itary effort— a chapter written, by 
part of a total force of nearly 12,000,- 
000 fighting men, and millions of 
Americans who scored tremendous 
production achievements in turning out 
goods for U. S. forces and their_Allies, 

When the war began in Europe in 
1939, the United States was neutral, 
but in early 1940, IL S. munitions and 
planes were sold to the French and 
British purchasing missions and 
America began to lend its aid in the 
war against aggression, 

IN September, 1940, in a move to aid 
Great Britain, then standing alone, 
the U. S. traded 50 ovei'age destroyers 
for a 99-year lease on naval bases in 
the western hemisphere. Then on 
March 19, 1941, Congress enacted the 
lend-lease act under which America's 
Allies were to receive assistance in 
goods and services valued at over 35 
billion dollars in the next four years. 
In December, 1941, when the struggle 
against aggression became global, the 
full might of America was thrown into 
the conflict, 

America's armed forces grew from 
700,000 to nearly 12,G0(h0O0 in four 
years. Seven and one-half million of 
these U, S. armed forces were over- 
seas or afloat as of March 31, 1945. 
America began her major military 
offensive against the Axis in the Euro- 
pean theater on November 8, 1942, 
when U. S. and British troops landed 
in French North Africa. Within six 
months, this American-British army, 
under the overall command of Gen. 
Eisenhower, had joined forces in Tuni- 
sia with the British Eighth Army 
which had driven westward from El 
Alamein, crushed half a million Axis 
troops, and completed the liberation of 
Africa. 

This liberation was the first strate- 
gic victory won from the Axis by the 
western Allies, It turned North Africa 
from an enemy base into an Allied 
springboard for operations on the con- 
tinent. It made possible the securing 
of the lifeline through the Mediter- 
ranean to Egypt, the Soviet Union and 
India, 

TVTEXT came Sicily. Following air- 
■f borne landings, American, Brit- 
ish, and Canadian troops stormed 
ashore on July 10, 1943. In a swift 
88-day operation they cleared this step- 
ping stone to the European mainland. 
Then came Italy. On September 9, 
1943, six days after the Italian gov- 
ernment capitulated, American and 
British soldiers of the U. S. Fifth 
Army fought their way onto the 
beaches at Salerno, just below Naples 

+ V 11S T^ ed the way for junction of 
the Fifth and British Eighth Army 
Wiich had advanced northward fr 



*he southern tip of Italy. Then came 
the capture of Naples, the seizure of 
,he great airbases at Foggia, the sec- 
leapfrog operation by the Filtn to 



mc 



Amio near Rome, and the ultimate 
capture of that capital on June 4 1944- 
Two days later, Allied forces landed 
in Normandy, France. U. S. Airborne 
and land armies and naval forces, par- 
ticipated in this assault, the greatest 
ovsrwater military operation in his- 
fcoiy. General Eisenhower again was 
in supreme command- Prior to this, 
American and British warplanes from 
Britain and Italy had carried the war 
Germany, paving the way with ex- 
p] sires and incendiaries, 

Or August 1, armored spearheads 
of the LI S, Third Army broke out of 
Normandy and raced eastward across 
Fi&mceL Paris was liberated and 
British arid Canadian armies drove 
northward through Belgium to the 
Netherlands border, 

Meanwhile, American and French 
forces landed in southern France on 
\ugust 15, liberated Toulon and 
Marseilles, and pushed northward up 
1< Rhone Valley, ultimately to join 
U. S. Third Army in eastern 
France before the German border. 
By the end of 1944, the Allies had 
liberated virtually all of France, Bel- 
gium, Luxembourg and part of the 
Netherlands, and had broken into 
Germany at scattered points.

First, Third, Seventh, Ninth, and later 
I "th Armies, prepared for the great at- 
tank which cost the Germans thousands 
of casualties. The Allies cleared the 
west bank of the Rhine, capturing the 
Saar, second only to the Ruhr in Ger- 
man war production importance. 

Finally, on March 7, the First Army 
established a bridgehead on the east 
bank of the Rhine after seizing intact 
the rail bridge at Remagen, south of 
Cologne. Fifteen days later, the Third 
Army won a bridgehead between 
Mainz and Worms, 

Two days later, the U. S. Ninth and 
British Second Armies, preceded by 
the First Allied Airborne Army, cross- 
ed the Rhine in the Wesel area north 
of the Ruhr. American Seventh and 
French First armies later established 
bridgeheads below Worms. 

The Allied armies broke out of these 
bridgeheads, smashed the main Ger- 
man def ense line in the west, and clr^ve 
cU-ep into the heart of Germany. One 
&reat German city after another fell. 
S: complete was the victory that in 
one 10-day period in early April, the 
Germans suffered 500,000 casualties — 
an unprecedented rate of 50,000 per 
day. 

Meanwhile, on the other side of 
the world, between December 7, 1941 
md April 1, 1945, America advanced 
her Pacific battle line over 5,000 
miles westward from Pearl Harbor 
to Okinawa, 350 miles south of 
Japan. 

During this period, when logistics 
and vast distances were as much an 
enemy as the Japanese, American and 
Allied forces cleared most of New 
ui-noa, captured the key islands in the

Solomons, Marshalls, Marianas, ax\( 
the Palaus, by-passing thousands of 
Japanese as they advanced. Liberating 
American troops under General Mac- 
Arthur landed on about 40 islands in 
the Philippines, freed the capital of 
Manila, and in a bloody battle, troops 
under Admiral Nimitz seized Iwo 
Jim a, then moved on to Okinawa. 
The American fleet whittled down 
and broke the back of the Japanese 
navy in successive battles which 
readied from Midway island in the 
Pacific to the Inland Sea of Japan. 
In the battle for Leyte Gulf alone, 
during the Philippine landings, 58 
Japanese warships were sunk or 
damaged. Army afcd Navy air power 
crippled the Japanese air force. 

FROM bases on Guam, Saipan and 
Tinian, American Super Fortresses 
began pounding war industries on the 
Japanese homeland. Fast carrier task 
forces sailed boldly off the enemy's 
home islands while warplanes from 
their decks attacked military targets 
in the Tokyo area and inflicted further 
damage on the Japanese fleet, which 
could not find safety even in its own 
Inland Sea. 

Behind these multi-front attacks has 
been the great productive capacity of 
America. When the U. S. entered the 
war as a belligerent, the supply situa- 
tion on every battlefront was critical. 
To the U. S. fell the major task of 
providing these materials for the 
United Nations. 

New factories, large and small, ship- 
yards and airfields were rushed to 
completion throughout the country. 
Construction of new plants including 
equipment rose to the record high level 
of some 800,000,000 dollars each 
month. In December, 1041. only 7,000,- 
000 persons were employed in war 
work. One year later th& figure was 
17,000,000 including a high proportion 
of women. 

From July, 1940 to December 31, 
1944, the U. S. produced 246,845 
airplanes of all types. This total in- 
cluded 28,471 heavy bombers, 79.77G 
fighters, and 19,000 transports. 

DURING the same period, the U. S. 
produced 56,697 naval vessels; in 
merchant ships 45,384,000 deadweight 
tons of cargo vessels were built. Also 
produced were 75,204 tanks, and 130,- 
017 tank destroyers and self-propelled 

guns. , : I ; *l 

Other production totals for the 
period included 2,422,099 machine- 
guns, 5,942,385 rifles, 5,163,826 car- 
bines, 1,926,405 sub-machinoguns, 
55,252 field artillery weapons, and 
769,468 tracks. 

In addition, communications, radio, 
and electronic equipment produced 
represented a combined eost.of 9,405,- 
000,000 dollars. 

Lend-lease supplies, military equip- 
ment, and rehabilitation cargoes were 
moved to all supply fronts by the 



Uninaions Charter 
Produces Greatest 
Military Coalition 

The United Nations declaration of 
January 1, 1942 a living monument to 
the vision of the late President Roose- 
velt, welded the military and economic 
power of the Allied nations into a uni- 
fied force which effected the defeat of 
Germany. 

This declaration pledged deter- 
mination of the original 26 signatory 
rations to maintain full cooperation 
"in the common struggle against a sav- 
age and brutal force seeking to sub- 
jugate the world." All of the nations 
subscribed to the embodied Atlantic 
Charter code for a "batter future for 
the world," and pledged not to con- 
clude a separate peace. This year it 
became a coalition of 47 nations, 85 
percent of the world's population 
against the enemy. 

Under the leadership of the heads 
of the larger nations measures were 
taken to perpetuate the United Nations 
in an international security organi- 
zation which resulted in Dumbarton 
Oaks and the current United Nations 
conference in San Francisco. 

More than two years ago Presi- 
dent Roosevelt in a message to Con- 
gress said: "Today the United Nations 
are the mightiest military coalition in 
history . . . the United Nations can 
and must rem a n united for the main- 
tenance of peace/'

three years, the merchant marine rais- 
ed its cargo tonnage from 11,000,000 
deadweight tons to 46,500,000 dead-

January 1, 1942 to April 1, 1945, 
2,651 Liberty ships and 328 Victory 
ships were built The total number 
constructed in this period was 4,800. 
Officers and men of the merchant 
marine numbered about 55,000 in 
1941; on April 12, 1945, there were 
216,700 men sailing U. S. cargo ships, 
American lend-lease aid to other 
United Nations from March, 1941 
through December, 1944 totalled 
35,382,000,000 dollars' worth of 
floods and services. The Soviet 
Union, the British Commonwealth, 
France and China have received 
about 98 per cent of United States 
lend-lease aid. 

THE price Amer'ca has paid in war 
material thus far cannot now be 
estimated, for cleaning up, repairing 
and packing of some of the equipment 
now in Europe for shipment to the 
Pacific may prove impracticable.

Luzon battlefront on April 27. 

Before reaching the front, the 
^ro up visited an artillery unit 
of the 11th Airborne division 
and Chinese guerrillas at Ba- 
tangas. They were warmly re- 
ceived by the troops and a 
speech was delivered to them by 
Mrs. It, Y. Mok, group leader 
and wife of the late Chinese 
Consul to Manila, who was kilt- 
ed during the Japanese occupa- 
tion. 

The group, was recently form- 
ed with Mrs, Dee C. Chuan, 
president of the Chinese 
Women's Relief Association, as 
chairman. 



After reading the statement, 
Sec. Delfin JaraniUa of the de- 
partment of justice declared- 

"President Truman's state 
meat is a matter for Eradica- 
tion for the Filipino people be- 
cause it is a policy already ap- 
proved by the late President 
Roosevelt after taking into con- 
sideration the desire of the 

Fl "Tak?ng into consideration all

as a result of Jap atrocities 
Secretary Jaranilla continued, 
"the offer of the President to 
lend economic assistance to ™ € 
Philippines is most welcomed. 
At present we are truly helpless, 
since we could not work on our 
lands for more than three years 
and the promised economic as- 
sistance after independence is 
God-send." 

Major General Basiho J- 
Valdes, secretary of Health and 
Welfare said: "I am very happy 
to have read that President 
Truman has specified that suit- 
able reciprocal trade between 
the United States and the Phil* 
ippines should continue for such 
time as may be necessary to 
provide the Philippines with a 
fair opportunity to secure its 
economic freedom and independ- 
ence. "In these post-war days, 
when almost every Filipino has 
lost most of his belongings, a 
complete understanding with the 
United States on trade recipro- 
city is vital to us." 

Sec, Tomas Confesor of the 
department of the interior said 
"it is a great statement because 
si, ^ives the Filipinos a feeling 
mi reassurance." 

"It is going to deepen the 
faith and confidence of the 
Filipino people in America/' 
Secretary Confesor went on to 
fifty. "This will further increase 
thii loyalty of the Filipinos to 
America and her democratic in- 
stitutions. That further justifies 
what I have said on several oc- 
casions that the Filipinos should 
walk hand in hand with Ameri- 
ca in solving- her economic and 
political problems," 

Commenting on the committee 
headed by Sen. Millard Tydings 
together with nine other Army, 
Navy and civilian experts as 
special envoy to Manila to study 
local conditions, Secretary Con- 
fesor concluded: 

"It is a very good committee 
and I'm sure that it will be 
sympathetic in dealing with the 
aspirations of our people and 
in giving us the necessary eco- 
nomic protection to insure an 
enduring independent Philip- 
pines," 

Budget Commissioner and 
Acting Secretary of Finance 
Tsmael Math ay expressed satis- 
faction on President Truman's 
^atement. Said Commissioner 
Math ay; 

"It is a source of K reat satis, 
faction that President Truman

MacArthur Salutes Victory 

Here is the text of Gen. Mac Arthur's V-E proclamation: 

My fellow Americans: 

I rejoice with you in the triumph of Allied arms which 
has restored human liberty to the enslaved peoples of Europe 
— rejoice that this phase of the titanic struggle in which our 
country has long been engaged has now been brought to a 
victorious conclusion — and rejoice that this command, present- 
ly engaging our remaining enemy on many fronts, will now 
be reinforced by those vast and powerful resources of war 
heretofore employed on the battlefields of Europe. Thrpugh 
this additional strength the Japanese empire will be the 
more speedily vanquished with greater economy of American 
and Allied life than otherwise would be possible. 

We rejoice over these things and in deep gratitude pay 
tribute to the gallant fighting men and service women who 
with our Allies have made them possible. In the historic

Partisans Help Spell Nazi Doom 



Silent Armies J 
Fight Against 
Tophcavy Odds 

New York— Throughout the 
seven years that Nazism spread, 
dominated, and controlled large 
parts of the European continent, 
beginning with the occupation 
of Austria and Czechoslovakia, 
patriots have fought and died 
to free themselves and their 
countries from Nazi terror. 

This European resistance 
movement, popular and sponta- 
neous in character and aided 
by national leaders in London, 
helped sabotage the German 
war effort for over five years. 
It also assisted both directly 
and indirectly the Allied armies 
which finally liberated Europe 
from Nazi domination. 

While larger nations formed 
patriot armies which fought the 
Germans in pitched battles, the 
smaller countries excelled in in- 
dividual acts of sabotage and 
passive resistance. 

However, all of Europe's pa- 
triots had this in common. At 
one time or another they wreck- 
ed trains, killed members of the 
Wehrmacht and Gestapo, com- 
mitted sabotage in factories and 
offices, withheld food supplies, 
and in many ways created a 
permanent state of danger and 
insecurity for invaders. And 
.every occupied country had an 
underground press. 

When war broke out on Sept- 
ember 1, 1939, the Nazis had 
already entrenched themselves 
in Austria and Czechoslovakia 
where they had throttled most 
of the opposition. 

The execution of Reinhard 
Heydrich, the brutal ruler of the 
so-called Czech protectorate, 
which resulted in the destruc- 
tion of many Czech lives and 
the burning of Lidice, was cred- 
ited to the underground, and 
during the battle of Vienna, 
Austrian patriots proved their 
worth by assisting the Red 
Army and sabotaging Nazi or- 
ders. 

The underground in Europe 
carried on its fight, fully aware 
of German methods of retalia- 
tion. And German retaliation 
'did not merely mean eye for eye 
and tooth for tooth. It meant 
10 and sometimes 100 lives for 
one. 

. Organized military resistance 
m Poland ended September 27, 
19 39, but . no Polish Quisling 
w as found to rule, the country. 
Instead, a powerful under- 
ground movement came into be- 
J n £- It fought the Nazis with 
™e same ferocity with which 
the oppressors sought to deci- 
mate all classes of Polish 
People. 

In P6)and, German brutality 
reached unprecedented propor- 
tj ons. The only form of punish- 
ment for minor and major of- 
fenses alike was death, mostly 
ky hansnng. According to of f i- 
C1 al Nazi terminology, Poles 
Wer e subhuman. Their stand- 
ard of living had to reduce to 
the lowest possible level. Pol- 
*sh Jews received the same 
treatment as the Jewish minor- 
ity all over Europe. Here, the 
Germans applied the principle 




GREECE LIBERATED — British troops advance through war- torn Greece to liberate country, with help of guerrillas, ending 
four years of Nazi rule. 



of biological extermination. In 
April 19, 1943, they began de- 
stroying the Warsaw ghetto. 
Outnumbered and poorly equip- 
ped, the Jews battled for over 
30 days against German tanks, 
planes, and machineguns until 
the ghetto was wiped out. 

All these horrors explain why 
no German was ever safe in 
Poland. Frequently German pa- 
pers warned Wehrmacht sol- 
diers to be on their guard 
against Polish women. 

During the Russian campaign, 
Polish patriots impeded the 
transport of troops and material 
to the eastern front. The up- 
rising of Warsaw's population 
in 1944, though it failed to lib- 
erate the city, remains one of the 
most heroic efforts of the war. 

On June 18, 19'40, the French 
underground was born. On that 
day, Gen. De Gaulle appealed to 
the French people over the Lon- 
don radio to continue the war 
against the Nazis in spite of the 
Franco-German armistice. 

The French rallied around 
this new leader who became a 
symbol of their resistance. 
While their army, navy and air- 
force were being reconstructed 
with Allied aid outside of 
France, underground groups 
formed inside the country. The 
region of Haute Savoie in south- 
ern France became the center of 
patriot activities, but other 
strongholds soon formed else- 
where. 

When the Allies landed in 
Normandy, June 16, 1944, they 
found remarkable coordination 
between underground centers. 
Frequently French Forces of the 
Interior cleared Germans out of 
towns before the Allies arrived. 
And the liberation of the French 
capital was preceded by the suc- 
cessful uprising of th« people 
of Paris. 

In France, as elsewhere, the 
Nazis applied severe repressive 
.measures to smother resistance, 



including the wholesale shooting 
of innocent hostages. The fate 
of Grenoble in southern France 
can be called a typical example 
of their barbarous conduct. 

On November 11, 1943— mark- 
ing last war's Armistice Day — 
thousands of Grenoble citizens, 
in defiance of Gestapo orders, 
paraded through the town in 
honor of their fallen patriots. 
On the same evening all resist- 
ance leaders of that region were 
shot by the Germans. This ter- 
ror act could not break Greno- 
ble's spirit; two days later, a 
powder magazine went up, kill- 
ing 200 German soldiers. And 
in the fall of 1944, this city was 
liberated by French resistance 
forces. 

Yugoslav patriots began liber- 
ating their country long before 
Soviet armies came to their 
help. The Yugoslav resistance 
movement started in April', 1941, 
after the people had overthrown 
the previously imposed pro- 
German government — a step 
which resulted in the immediate 
German invasion. 

Thousands of patriots fled to 
the mountains to organize re- 
sistance. Despite the severest 
German reprisal's, Yugoslavs 
kept on fighting what some- 
times looked like a hopeless bat- 
tle. But their day came on Oc- 
tober 20, 1944 when patriot 
forces of Marshal Tito, together 
with the Red Army, marched 
into Belgrade. 

The peaceful Norwegians who 
had kept out of wars for many 
generations turned into implac- 
able fighters when the Nazis 
invaded their country. Men, 
women, and children found ways 
of djsobeving the enemy. There 
were strikes and anti-Nazi dem- 
onstrations in Oslo. Many items 
in the German-controlled Nor- 
wegian press revealed that Ger- 
man soldiers in Norway were 
demoralized by hostile Norse 
and wanted to go home.

to see this day. General Eisen- 
hower informs me that the 
forces of Germany have surren-

The flaps of freedom fly over 
all Europe. 

"For this victory we join in 
offering our thanks to the 
Providence which has guided 
and sustained us through the 
dark days of adversity, 

"Our rejoicing is sobered and 
subdued by a supreme conscious- 
ness of the terrible price we 
have paid to rid the world of 
Hitler and his evil band. Let 
us not forget, my fellow Ameri- 
cans, the sorrow and the heart- 
break which today abide in the 
homes of so many of our neigh- 
bors, 

"We can repay the debt which 
we owe to our dead and to our 
children only by ceaseless devo- 
tion to the responsibilities which 
lie ahead of us, If I cnuld give 
you a single watchword for the 
following months, it is— work, 
\vo*k. work, 

"We must work to finish the 
war. Our victory is but half 
wnn. The West is free but the 
East is still in bondage to the 
treacherous tyranny of the 
Japanese. When the last Jap- 
anese division has surrendered 
unconditionally, then only will 
our f'ghtinp: job be done. 

"We must work to bind the 
wounds of a suffering world— 
to build an abiding peace only 
by hard, toilsome, painstaking 
w»rk — by understanding and 
working with our allies in peacr 
as w e hnve in war* 

"The jnh is no less important, 
nn less dificult. than the task 
whMi now happily is done. 

"I ™il upon every Americnr 
to stick to his post until the 
last battle is won. Until that 
day, let no man abandon his 
post or slacken his efforts* 

"And now I want to read to 
you mv formal proclamation of 
this occasion. . 

"The Allied armies through 
sacrifice and with God's helm 
bn^e wrnne* f"nm Germany final 
pnd unconditional surrender. 
The western world ha^ been rid 
of the evil forces which for five 
y*fiT*s i^orer have imprison- 
ed the bodies and Btfnlifft tftp 
livf»<? of millions n^on mil Hons of 
ftmWrri men. They have vio- 
fcted their churches. d°stroved 
tM^T homes, cor runted their 
children, and murdered their 



loved ones. Out armies of libe- 
ration have restored freedom to 
these suffering peoples, whose 
spirit and will the oppressors 
could never enslave* 

"Much remains to be done. 
The victory won in the west 
must now be won in the east. 
The whole world must be cleans- 
ed of the evil from which half 
the world has been freed. Unit- 
ed, the peace loving nations have 
demonstrated in the West that 
their arms are stronger by far 
than the might of the dictators 
or the tyranny of militarv 
cliques that once called us soft 
and weak, The power of our 
peoples to Uefcnd themselves 
against all enemies, will be 
proved in the Pacific war as 
it has been proved in Europe. 

"For the triumph of spirit 
and of arms which we have won, 
and for its promise to peoples 
everywhere who join us in the 
Vovc of freedom, it is fitting that 
we, as a nation, give thanks to 
Almighty God, who has 
strengthened and given us the 
victory. 

"Now, therefore, I, Harry S. 
Truman, President of the 
United States of America, do 
N erebv appoint Sunday, May 
13, 1945 to be a day of prayer. 

"I call upon the people of the 
T Tnited States, whatever their 
ff aM; to unite in offering joy- 
ul thanks to God for the vic- 
ory we have won and to pray 
hat He will supwrt us to the

"I also call upon my country 
men to dedicate this day of 
grayer to the memory of those 
who have tfiven their lives to 
Tiake possible our victory.

hereunto set my hand and cau scr-

LONDON — Ten hours and 10 minutes after Presi- 
dent Truman and Prime Minister Churchill proclaimed 
victory in Europe, Premier Marshal Stalin of Russia 
yesterday announced the unconditional surrender of all 
German forces "to the supreme commander in chief of 
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the supreme 
command of Allied forces."

lation to the Russian people said that unconditional sur-

for the German High Command 
in the presence of British Air

Moscow radio followed Sta-

Soviet Union "to mark the vic- 
tory of the Soviet people over 
the Germans and the Red 
Army's historic victories which 
led to the full rout of Hitler

San Francisco — The Jap-

meeting on the European situa- 
tion and Foreign Minister Shi- 
genori Togo met again with 
Emperor Hirohito as the Tokyo 
radio yesterday told the Jap- 
anese people of Germany's un- 
conditional surrender. 

Dom.ei said Germany was 
defeated because Hitler "made 
the one mistake of underestimat- 
ing the power of the Soviet 
Union." The attack on Russia 
"despite the existence of a non- 
aggression pact must be attri- 
buted to the fact that the god 
of fortune had been favoring 
Hitler too well and he became 
intoxicated by his good luck," 
Domei added. 



Truman Tells 
Japan to Quit 

^ WASHINGTON — Preceding h!s radio proclamation to the 
nation on Germany's surrender. President Truman Tuesday 
warned Japan that M our blows will not cease until the Japanese 
military and naval forces lay down their arms/ 1 

In a grimly-worded statement handed to reporters at the 
White House, President Truman defined unconditional surrender 
terms to Japan and urged the Japanese people to get rid of 
their military leaders. He said: 

"Nazi Germany has been defeated. The Japanese peopie 
have felt the weight of our land, air and naval attacks. So long 
as their leaders and the armed forces continue the war, the 
striking power and intensity of our blows will steadily increase 
and bring utter destruction to Japan's industrial war production, 
to its shipping and to everything that supports its military. 

"The longer the war lasts, the greater will be the suffer- 
ing and hardships which the people of Japan will undergo, *fl 
in vain. Our blows will not cease until the Japanese military 
and naval forces lay down their arms in unconditional surrender. 
"Just what does unconditional surrender of the armed forces 
mean for the Japanese people? 

"It means the end of the war. It means termination of the 
influence of the military leaders who have brought Japan to the 
present brink of disaster. 

"It means provision for the return of soldiers and sailors to' 
their families, their farms, their jobs. 

"It means not prolonging the present agony and suffering of 
the Japanese in the vain hope of victory, or enslavement of the 
Japanese people."

Osmena Keynotes Rejoicing 
Of Philippines in Victory 

Washington— President Sergio Osmena, comment 
mg on the victory in Europe yesterday, declared "ail 
liberty loving peoples of the world rejoice in the fallow*- 
edge that totalitarian Germany has met defeat." 

"Although far removed from^ 
European battlefronts," he con- 
tinued, "Filipinos have been 
fully aware that our enemies 
must be beaten everywhere if 
principles for which we have 
been fighting are to survive. 

"Although the defeat of Ger- 
many is a decisive step, the 
United Nations must not rest 
until Japan likewise is com- 
pletely crushed. Then, and only 
then will the way be cleared for 
establishment of enduring peace 
and security in the world."

DRIVING ON THE RIGHT 

On June I, three weeks from now, road traffic in the Phil- 
ippines will, reverse a custom hundreds of years old and begin 
to go on the right hand side of the highway. 

The change in habits of Filipino cocheros, chauffeurs and 
pedestrians will be a revolutionary one, but like swimming in a 
cold pool it will be fine after the first plunge. 

There are several good reasons behind the Commonwealth's 
decision to change from left-hand to right-hand driving. The 
best one is economic. So long as traffic went to the left in the 
Philippines, anyone importing a truck or an automobile had to 
spend at least P200 extra to get a vehicle with the steering wheel 
on the right-hand side. Many hundreds of thousands of pesos 
will be saved when regular American equipment can be imported 
into the Philippines. 

At present it is estimated that 95 percent of all vehicles 
operating on Philippine roads belong to the American army and 
are driven by American drivers. Since they have driven on the 
right most of their lives, it will be a simple matter for them to 
switch over. 

Carretela cocheros and carreton drivers will find it a little 
harder to make the switch, but they are notorious individualists 
who usually drive wherever they please anyway. Those who 
survive the first week of right-hand driving should soon be recon- 
ciled to the new regulations. 

Certainly there is no time like the present to make >he 
change. And once the change has been made, everyone prob- 
ably will wonder why it wasn't done many years ago

Rise of U.S. Airpower One of War's Miracl 

Output Jumps from 866 



To 96,000 Planes a Year 

Washington— The development of American air 
nrnver in little more than three years into the deadly 
■arhead of Allied force was one of the prime factors 



in 



bringing about the final defeat of Germany, 
Building of our military air force had hardly begun 
when the U. S. plunged into war. During the 12 months 
period from June 30, 1939, until June, 1940, the* U. S. 
AAF. received only 886 planes from manufacturers. 

Wlate as January 15, 1941, <8> 

Hip entire air arm consisted of 
Sv 6,180 officers, 7,000 flying 
cadets, 88 enlisted men, and was 
;hort of aircraft due in part to 
sending urgently needed planes 
to air forces of other friendly 

na ^he Japanese attack and the 
sudden expansion of war to 
global proportions presented 
American with a gigantic task 
—to build up an airf orce and at 
the same time, to fight in the 
Pacific and in areas all over the 
world to hold off the enemy 
until we could build up offen- 
sive strength. Simultaneously, 
we were called upon to deliver 
planes and accessories to our 
allies to enable them to defend 
themselves while gathering 
strength to carry the war to the 
enemy. 

At the end of 1941, total per- 
sonnel in the A.A.F. was 101,- 
'227. By the end of 1942, it was 
354,161. In 1943 it increased 
to 1,597,049, and on January 1, 
1945, numbered 2,359,500. Air- 
craft manufacturers kept pace 
with the growth of personnel. In 
1942, plane production increased 
to 47,873 planes of all types, in 
1943 to 85,946, and in 1944 to 
96,369. 

As pilots were trained and 
planes became available, the 
U. S. air arm went into combat 
on an increasing scale^ until it 
was able to mount single at 
tacks by as many as 3,000 
planes. At the same time, its 
air transport service expanded 
rapidly, and today is transport- 
ing large numbers of men and 
great quantities of war mate- 
rials everywhere in the globe. 

Army Air Forces became a

deciding factor in the victory 
over Germany with strategic 
raids on German aircraft pro- 
duction facilities, oil refineries, 
tank manufacturing plants, and 
ball bearing factories, which 
began in February, 1944. 

At the same time, attacks 
on widely scattered areas 
wiped out the entire produc- 
ing capacity of many plants 
and cut sharply the capacity 
of others. Germany never 
recovered from these blows. 
The German air force, de- 
prived of replacements 
through the destruction of 
aircraft factories and oil re- 
fineries, declined steadily. 
Paralleling the growth of 
the A. A. F. is that of the U. S. 
Navy's air arm. Often forced 
by the nature of war in the 
Pacific to send its planes into 
combat from aircraft carriers, 
the Navy in cooperation with 
the Army, has gained victory 
after victory over Japanese air 
power and recently has been 
sending its carriers within 
fighter range of the Japanese 
homeland, secure in knowledge 
its planes are superior to any- 
thing the enemy can send 
against it. 

Directly attributable to air 
power is the change in con- 
cept of sea power. More than 
one decisive battle has been 
fought in the Pacific by hun- 
dreds of planes from opposing 
carrier forces with surface 
units never making contact. 
The battle of the Coral Sea 
in May, 1942, which was fought 
entirely by carrier aircraft, and 
the battle of Midway in the 
next month, fought by carrier 
aircraft and land-based Flying 
Fortresses, turned the tide of 
Japanese expansion in the 
South Pacific and started the 
Japanese withdrawal from its 
conquered areas. / 

Losses of combat planes as 
tabulated by the U. S., A. A. F. 
indicate a ratio of nearly three 
enemy planes lost to one Ameri- 
can plane in the period since 
America has been at war. 

Return of Civil 
Government Asked 

In an interview with Sec. 
Tomas Confesor of the depart- 
ment of the interior, guerrilla 
leaders and prominent citizens 
of Ilocos Norte recommended 
the establishment of civil gov- 
ernment in Hocos Norte, re- 
opening of the Philippine 
National Bank and the Agricul- 
tural and Industrial Banks, 
establishment of a branch of the 
CIC of the U. S. Army, the 
.Philippine Civil Affairs Unit 
and reorganization of the Philip-

Secretary Jaranilla of the de- 
partment of justice said he had

was revealed yesterday. 

According to an internal 
revenue official, 9 persons were 
caught manufacturing cigars 
and cigarettes without license

Santa Ana Cabaret 
To Reopen Saturday 

The Santa Ana Cabaret, 
largest cabaret in the world,

ANOTHER ROBBER VICTIM 

Close on the heels of the

and stole clothes, valuables and

over the PCAU units in Santa 
Ana and Pasay and is furnish- 
ing the same service to the 
people. 

ECA personnel are trained 
for the work prior to their 
taking over control and adminis- 
tration of PCAU units. 

Under this arrangement, and 
in an effort to relieve the price 
situation, the Army continues 
furnishing ration goods for re- 
lief and ECA officials will also 
distribute locally produced goods 
to supplement the present 
ration. 

ECA officials are making 
preliminary surveys for the 
procurement of additional sup- 
plies in the provinces. 

Secretary of the Interior, 
Tomas Confesor, as head of the 
organization, told ECA officials 
he intends to combat the black 
market by means of the ECA 
stores. 

The ECA stores will distri- 
bute to the public locally pro- 
duced goods such as meats, fish 
and vegetables plus the goods 
now being rationed by the Army. 

Confesor believes this plan 
will at least partially break 
the black market. 

ECA officials, revealing a 
survey has been made of rice 
supplies in nearby provinces, 
attacked hitfh market prices. 
ECA officials pointed out rice 
is being rationed to city in- 
habitants on relief, while others 
obtain it through PCAU, making 
high prices "inexcusable." 

The public excitement over 
the supply of rice comes from 
buyers in the black market who 
are engaged in making bread 



out of rice flour for black 
market consumption, ECA offi- 
cials said. 

The officials declared there 
are plenty of rice substitutes in 
the market, such as camotes, 
which are rotting in the market 
for want of buyers.

Truman Sends Messages to Stalin, Churchill, 
Eisenhower, and DeGaulle on Europe T riumph 



Washington— President Truman yesterday from^T 
the White House sent messages of congratulation to 
Gen Eisenhower, Marshal Stalin, Prime Minister Chur- 
chill, and Gen, Charles D e Gaulle, on the cessation of 
hostilities in Europe. 



Truman's message to 
Churchill said: 

"With the unconditional 
surrender of all the armies 
of Nazidom and the libe- 
ration of the oppressed people 
of Europe from the evils of 
barbarism, I wish to express to 
you, and through you to Brit- 
ish's heroic army, navy and 
air forces, our congratulations 
on their achievements. The gov- 
ernment of the United States 
is deeply appreciative of the 
splendid contribution of all 
British Empire forces and of 
the British people to this mag- 
nificent victory, 

"With warm affection, we 
hail our comrades in arms 
across the Atlantic." 

Truman sent the following 
V-E Day sentiments to Marshal 
Stalin; "Now that the Nazi 
armies of aggression have been 
forced by the co-ordinated ef- 
forts of Soviet-Anglo-Ameri- 
can forces to unconditional sur~ 
render, I wish to express to you, 
and through you to your heroic 
army, the appreciation and con- 
gratulations of the United 
States government on its splen- 
did contribution to the cause of 
civilization and liberty, 

"You have demonstrated in 
all your campaigns what it is 
possible to accomplish when 
free people under superlative 
leadership and with unfailing 
courage, rise against the forces 
of barbarism*" 

The President sent the fol- 
lowing to General Eisenhower: 
"In recognition of the uncondi- 
tional and abject surrender of 
the Nazi barbarism, please ac- 
cept the fervent congratulations 
and appreciation of myself and 
of the American people for the 
heroic achievements of your 
Allied army, navy and air 
forces* By their sacrifices, 
skill and courage they have 
saved and exalted 'the cause of 
freedom throughout the world. 
All of us owe to you and to 
your men of many nations a 



debt beyond appraisal for their 
high contribution to the con- 
quest of Naziism. 

"I send, also, my personal ap- 
preciation of the superb leader- 
ship shown by you and your 
commanders in directing the 
valiant legions of our own 
country and of our Allies to 
this historic victory* 

"Please transmit this message 
to the appropriate officers of 
your command and publish it to 
all Allied forces in your 
theatres of operation. 

To Gen, Charles De Gaulle, 
head of the French provisional 
government, Truman said : "The 
Nazi forces of barbarian aggres- 
sion having now been driven into 
unconditional surrender by our 
Allied armies, this is an appro- 
priate time to send, through 
you, America's congratulations 
to the people of France on their 
permanent liberation from the 
aggression they have endured 
with high courage for so long* 

"I wish, also, to send to you 
this expression of our apprecia- 
tion of the contribution made by 
the valiant soldiers of France to 
our Allied victory."

TROOPS LEAVE ITALY FOR PACIFIC 



U.S. Troops Capture 
Goering and Kesselring 



Top Nazi Says 
Hitler Tried 
To Kill Him 

PARIS — Reichsmarshal 
Hermann Wilhelm Goering, 
at one time designated by 
Hitler as his successor, and 
Marshal Albert Kesselring, 
former German commander 
of the western front were 
captured yesterday by U. S. 
Seventh Army troops, 
Supreme Headquarters, 
Allied Expeditionary Force, 
announced yesterday. 

The capture of Goering, ac- 
_ companied by his wife and child, 
was made on a road east of 
Kitsbuehl, in southern Bavaria. 
All three appeared to be in good 
health when taken. 

The fat Reichsmarshal told 
his captors he had been sen- 
tenced to death by Adolf 
Hitler on April 24 for sug- 
gesting that he, Goering, take 
over the Reich. 

Goering revealed that he had 
been arrested by Hitler's S* S. 
troops and that he was later 
rescued by his "own" airmen. 

Goering's wife was the former 
Emmy Sonnenmann, who in 
earlier days was Hitler's lead- 
ing hostess. 

The Reichsmarshal dis- 
closed that he understood that 
Hitler had died and that he 
last saw him on April 27 or 
28. 

Goering, born 52 years ago m 
Bavaria, had more money, more 
uniforms and medals ^than any 
other Nazi. His obesity and 
love of medals made him a fa- 
vorite subject for caricaturists 
outside of Germany. 
Nevertheless, Goering was 
. one of the Nazi's most brutal 
leaders. Among his most sinis- 
ter achievements was the build 
ing of the German airforce 
which was the scourge of 
Europe in the early days of the 
war. 

Kesselring was the last Ger- 
man commander in action on 
Germany's west front until his 
armies were broken by the 
Allied advance. 

He was shifted from Italy 
last March to succeed Field 
Marshal Von Rundstedt after a 
series of reverses to the Nazi 
armies in the west. 



Quisling Surrenders to Me* 
At Ex-Gestapo Prison in Oslo 

OSLO — Vidkun Quisling, puppet premier of the Nazi sponsored 
government in Norway for the last five years, was arrested Tuesday 
by Allied officers when he surrendered at the Oslo police station, 
formerly a Gestapo prison. 

Quisling, whose name has become a world synonym for betrayal, 
drove to the police station in a bullet-proof car with six of his cabinet 
members. 

The Quisling ministers reported to be ander arrest include: Propa- 
ganda Minister Rolf Fuglesand; Minister of Social Affairs J. A. Lip- 
pestan; Minister of Church and Education F. Skancke; Minister of 
Labor Service Anton Stang; and Minister of Trade and Commerce 
Alf Whist. 



Japan Rocks Under 
Heaviest B-29 Raid 

GUAM — More than 400 Super Fortresses — the 
largest B-29 fleet ever to attack Japan — bombed im- 
portant naval oil storage depots on southeastern Honshu 
and airfields on Kyushu, yesterday. 

The daylight strike on Honshu ^ 
carried Super Fortress bombers 



over Tokuyama and Otake fuel 
storage and manufacturing 
areas on the Inland Sea r in a 
concentrated effort to destroy 
the major source of Japan's 
aviation fuel. 

Four separate targets were 
bombed in the initial strike on 
oil supply areas. While the 
bulk of the Superforts con- 



Giles Pledges Round 
Clock Bombing on Japs 

Guam — Lt. Gen. Barney M. 
Giles, commander of Army 
Air Forces in Pacific Ocean 
areas said yesterday, Ameri- 
can bombers soon will be 
dropping more high explosives 
on Japan than were used 
against Germany. 

Disclosing present plans 
call for "very fast build up 
of B-29 forces, Giles added 
"round the clock bombing of 
Japan is in the not too dis- 
tant future."

and nearby southern Shikoku. 

The huge bombers took off 
from coral runways on Guam, 
Tinian, and Saipan m relays, 
shortly after midnight, to 
drone over the Inland Sea for 
several hours. 



New York Port 
Halts Shipping 

New York — The New York 
port of embarkation Wednesday 
virtually halted outgoing ship- 
ments of battlefield supplies for 
Europe and celebrated V-E Day 
by preparing for an expansion 
of war material shipments to 
the Pacific. 

Except for material already 
on the high seas, the only sup- 
plies now scheduled for ship- 
ment to Europe were food and 
clothing, Maj. Gen. Homer M. 
Groninger, the N. Y. port com- 
mander, revealed. He also dis- 
closed that the gradual ending 
of the fighting in Germany 
made it possible to begin taper- 
ing off shipments almost two 
weeks ago. This avoided any 
abrupt stoppage, the port com- 
mander explained. 

Gen. Groninger declared: "In 
the weeks and months ahead all 
the efforts of the port will be 
centered on moving the army's 
war power into the Pacific and 
bringing home men eligible for 
discharge. 



Mac Arthur Air 
Strikes Sever 
Jap Sea Lines 

Gen. MacArthur's blockade 
bombers have practically swept 
organized enemy commerce from 
the high seas, sinking or severe- 
ly damaging 1,892,082 tons of 
Japanese shipping in the first 
four months of this year, today's 
communique announced. 

Bitter fighting raged between 
the Davao and Taloma rivers 
south of the liberated capital as 
U. S. 24th Division troops ham- 
mered enemy strongpoints 
against machinegun, mortar 
and heavy artillery fire. Mon- 
day and Tuesday, swarms of 
dive bombers supported the 
American attack, it was dis- 
closed. 

Japanese civilians of Davao 
were reported to have evacuated 
up a dirt road leading to Kibawe 
prior to the fall of the city. 

On Luzon, 43rd Division 
doughboys and attached guer- 
rillas were closing in on the Ipo 
dam east of Manila. Guerrilla 
units advanced about five mile 
in the past 24 hours and wer 
now only 5,000 yards north of 
the dam. Other columns swing- 
ing from the south were 2,000 
yards from Ipo Dam, largest of 
three supplying Manila with 
water. 

Off Borneo, Australian troops 
met almost negligible opposition, 
driving to the southern fringe 
of the Djoeata oilfields. 



Shift Already 
Begun, Allied 
Leader Reveals 

ROME— Gen. Joseph T. 
McNarney, deputy supreme 
commander in the Mediter- 
ranean theater, declared 
last night that the Allies 
have already begun ship- 
ping combat and service 
troops from Italy direct to 
the Pacific for the war 
against Japan. 

According to American press 
dispatches, McNarney said other 
troops would be sent from Italy 
to the Pacific by way of the 
United Stated. 

The return to civilian life 
for the majority of American 
troops in Italy would come 
only after Japan had been de- 
feated, the general added. 
All troops in the European 
and Mediterranean theaters had 
been divided into groups for dis- 
position, he said. 

"The first group will consist 
of men to be retained overseas 
and required for occupation,

THE SYMPHONY CONCERTS 

One of the most significant events that has occurred since 
ie liberation of Manila is the current opening ot the iw 
.ymphony season, in the ruins of the Santa Cruz church. 

it is a far cry from the pre-war symphony concerts. In 
liose days a cosmopolitan crowd dressed in magnificerrf rnestjja 
-ostumes, Paris creations, sharkskin tuxedoes and mess [ackers, 
irove up to the Metropolitan Theater In luxurious limousines, 
md enjoyed their Bach and Beethoven in air-conditioned com- 
ort: The current series of concerts is attended by American 
ir my officers and men in khaki shirts, open at the throat, and 
-iflpino civilians who are lucky if they have sa vaged a single 
4iite drill suit or cheap cotton dress from their burned-out 
tome*. They drive to the concerts in jeeps, or nde in carreteias 
ir even walk. Overhead the stars shine down upon them, and 
saintly, through the night, comes the occasional rumble ot a 
sull-dozer clearing up the havoc wrought by the enemy in tne 
ince fair city of Manila. . 

But the music is there, the Occidental music that has lent 
so much to the cultures of all the world- This music, rising from 
■he ruins of a desolated Oriental city, demonstrates anew the 
-aiture of the Jap* to divide the East from the West, It also 
demonstrates the abitf ng faith of the Filipinos In their own close 
-connections with the West, and with America. 

To Dr. Herbert Zipper, who overcame almost insurmountable 
obstacles in putting on these concerts, all credit is due. He 
himself has felt the lash of Naztism in the once notorious con- 
centration camp at Dachau. The concert, coming on the day 
after V-E Day t is a personal triumph for him as well as for the 
culture which he represents and which Filipinos, through their 
own choice, will once more have the advantage of pursuing.

Treasury Redeems 
Mutilated Notes 

Thousands of mutilated 
Philippine treasury certifi- 
cates were presented daily 
during the past two weeks to 
the insular treasury for 
redemption* 

Records of the treasury 
show that during the two- 
week period, partly mutilated 
certificates redeemed amount- 
ed to about P175,00Q, bringing 
the total since the reestablish- 
ment of the government here 
to P36T,000. 

The majority of the redeem- 
ed notes were partly burned 
and many of them had to be 
reinforced with bond paper to 
prevent their pulling apart A 
considerable number were 
found to be torn and soiled. 



W A S H I N GTON — The 
American people and their 
allies must "devote their 
full and overwhelming 
force 1 * to the war in the 
Pacific, acting Secretary of 
State Joseph C. Grew, who 
was ambassador to Japan 
at the start of the war, de- 
clared in a broadcast Wed- 
nesday following announce- 
ment of victory in Europe 
He warned the war is not 
won so long as Japan re- 
mains a "powerful and im- 
placable" enemy, 

"This is a day of magnificent 
victory," he continued, "Let us 
make It also a clay of solemn 
rededieation to the unfinished 
work ahead. 1 ' 

lf We k&ve won a great bat- 
tie in the world-wide fight for 
human freedom, but — on the 
global scale on which we fight 
— we have not yet won the 
war." 

Grew reminded his listeners 
that "as we pay tribute to the 
valor of our combat forces 
across the Atlantic who have 
won this great victory, let us 
also remember and pay tribute 
to the valor of our combat for- 
ces across the Pacific who still 
ficrht in the heat of the day. 
Fo? they have a tough and 
blood-stained road ahead of 
them, and it is up to us to see 
them through/' 

After referring to Japan's 
preparations for a last-ditch 
defense* Grew added. 

"But the Japanese military 
ists must know by now that 
they will be crushed. The 
Handwriting is on the wall,** 

"We are blasting their 
defenses by land and sea and air* 
We are separating Japan from 
her overseas conquests and gain- 
ing positions for new assaults* 
Our offensive is relentless and 
inexorable— we are determined 
to destroy Japan's war-making 
power once and for all."

Throngs Gather 
In Times Square 
Tuesday Night 

Washington — The peo- 
ple of the United States 
celebrated V-E Day Wed- 
nesday by staying on their 
jobs and working to hasten 
the similar defeat of Japan. 

A few war workers took a 
brief respite, but the over- 
whelming majority followed 
President Truman's injunction 
to "work, work work." Through- 
out the nation, churches threw 7 
open their doors to the hundreds 
of thousands who attended brief 
services of thanksgiving for the 
victory already won and pray- 
ers for a speedy victory over 
Japan. 

Hundreds of thousands of peo- 
ple poured into New York's 
streets Tuesday immediately 
following Truman's victory 
broadcast, with an estimated 
200,000 in Times Square. Mid- 
town streets were covered with 
ticker tape and torn paper. 
Wednesday's celebration, how- 
ever, was much quieter. 

In Philadelphia, throngs 
ignored a downpour of rain to 
gather at Independence hall 
where the city's mayor tapped 
the historic 'Liberty Bell seven 
times to -signalize the seventh 
war loan during a nation-wide 
bro^cast. 

The Midwest observed V-E- 
Day in comparative quiet and 
war production went steadily 
forward. 

On the Pacific coast, where 
eyes already were focussed on 
Japan, the people went quietly 
and thankfully about their tasks. 
Seattle workers did not inter- 
rupt the building of Superfort- 
resses at the Boeing aircraft 
plant. During a ten-minute rest 
period, 1,500 workers assembled 
and pushed a newly completed 
B-29 — named On to Tokyo — on

gon Street where he attempt- 
ed to hide. A Filipino M. P. 
ran after him and ordered 
him to surrender. 

The Jap fished out a hand 
grenade from his pocket and 
was about to hurl it when the 
M.P. shot him.

Admiral Chester W. Nimitz 

Nimitz Says Japan May Quit, 
But Invasion Planned In Case 

GUAM — U. S. Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz yes- 
terday announced that the first effect of victory in 
Europe would be the very material acceleration of air 
war against Japan, adding plans for invasion of the 
homeland are being prepared in case the Japanese are 
unable to "perceive the inevitable." 

Japan will be hit "with every-3^ 
thing we have" in land-based 
and fleet air power, he told a 
press conference. Increased air 
attacks will come first as a 
result of the European peace, 
"because airforces are the first 
which can be moved." 

He added, however, that car- 
rier forces would also increase 
their activity against Japan, 
emphasizing "there is no part 
of Japan that cannot be reach- 
ed by carrier planes." 

"I do not know how much the 
Japanese can take. If they can 
see the handwiting on the wall, 
they can see what happened to 
Germany. However, we will 
plan the invasion of Japan and 
go ahead on the basis that inva- 
sion will be necessary." 

Regarding possible Japanese 
surrender, Nimitz explained the 
"Japanese have displayed a lot 
of intuition and intelligence in 
this war in many respects. They 
ought to be able to perceive the 
inevitable." 



To Hold Open House 

PCAU 5 general hospital on 
Calle Espaiia, Sampaloc, will

on Saturday in connection with

Special muss will be held in the

RHEIMS — How General Eisenhower sternly an- 
swered the German Gen, Jodi's plea for generous treat- 
ment in the surrender of the German armies to the 
Allies, signed Sunday in the red brick schoolhouse at 
Rheims, is pictured in the following eye-witness dis- 

P£LtC "After he had asked for the text of the surrender, 
and after representatives of the Allies had ag reed upon 
them, Jodl asked for per-t" 



mission to speak. He was 
told 1/hat he might. His 
voice jwas slow aaid soft- 
Penning his name to the 
surrender terms, he said: 

"'With this signature the 
German people and the armed 
farces are, for better or worse, 
delivered into the victor's hands- 

" 'In this war, which has 
lasted more than five years, 
both have achieved and suf- 
fered more than perhaps any 
other people in the world* In 
this hour I can only express 
the hope, that the victor will 
treat generously with them,' 

"Jodi's face was expression- 
less, and so were the faces of 
the American, British, Russian 
and French officials who re- 
presented the Allies. 

"All had seen the Ger- 
man murder camps, and ail 
knew the furious cruelty of the 
German occupying forces. 

"The moment passed in dead 
silence. 

"Then the German represen- 
tatives were taken down the 
hall to Gen. Eisenhower, who 
hadn't been present at the sign- 
ing, 

"Eisenhower and his Deputy 
Air Chief, Marshal Sir Arthur 
Tedder, were waiting. 

"They stood behind Eisen- 
hower's small desk* 

"There was a moment of 
heavy silence* and then Eisen- 
hower spoke. 

"He was brief, terse as al- 
ways* His steel blue eyes were 
hard. In a few clipped sentences 
he made it plain that Germany 
was a defeated nation. 

"Then the Germans filed out. 
It was over." 

Describing the solemn pre- 
liminary scenes to Eisenhower's 
meeting with the conquered foe- 
men, one dispatch said:

Surrender Pact 
No Paper Scrap 

London — Marshal Stalin 
Tuesday in a personal broad- 
cast to the Russian people 
said that German's final act 
of surrender in Berlin "is not 
only a piece of paper" but a 
"true capitulation of Ger- 
many" forced "to her knees by 
the Red Army and the troops 
of our Allies;' Stalin further 
informed the Russian people 
that "now we can say with 
full foundation that this is a 
day of complete victory." 

Shortly after his personal 
broadcast, Stalin issued his 
final order of the day to the 
Red Army and Navy announc- 
ing unconditional surrender of 
Germany, congratulating the 
army and navy on the victo- 
rious conclusion of the war, 
and ordering a triumphal sa- 
lute of 30 salvos from 1,000 
Moscow guns,

Vinson Lifts 
Few War Sans 

Washington — U. S. War 
Mobilization Director Fred M. 
Vinson, said Tuesday the crush- 
ing of Japan will' defer indefi- 
nitely in the United States any 
large scale demobilization, re- 
conversion of industry for peace 
time production or relief from 
present shortages of food, cloth- 
ing, and other goods and 
services. 

Vinson, citing some home 
front reconversions, announced 
an immediate lifting of the ban 
on horse and dog racing and 
abolition of the midnight enter- 
tainment curfew. 

However he disclosed that 
transportation restrictions on 
personnel, animals, and specta- 
tors to sports events would be 
continued.

Russian and Allied mili- 
tary chiefs watched as pa- 
pers were signed by Field 
Marshal Wilhelm Keitel as 
commander of the German 
Army, Admiral Von Friede- 
hurg f navy commander, and 
General Stump, air force 
chief. 

Before the ceremonies began, 
Zhukov addressed British, 
American, French and Russian 
representatives, saying 1 ; 

^Gentlemen, we have gath- 
ered here to accept the terms 
of unconditional surrender 
from the command of the 
German armed forces. I pro- 
pose we get to -work." 

Thereupon, on orders from 
Zhukov, the Germans were led 
into the hall for the first time 
in absolute silence. 

Zhukov then said: "Gentle- 
men, the signing of the act of 
unconditional surrender will now 
take place, I address myself to 
the representatives of the Ger- 
man command with the ques- 
tions — have they the act at 
hand, have they acquainted 
themselves with it, and are the 
representatives of the Supreme 
German Command prepared to 
sign this act?" 

Deputy Air Chief, Marshal 
Sir Arthur Tedder, represent- 
ing Gen* Eisenhower, addressed 
the same questions to the Ger-

US. Arranging 
Court 
For Axi$ Thugs 

San Francisco— Judge Sam- 
uel L Rosenman, special assist 
ant to President Truman ar- 
rived here several day$ ago to 
arrange for "organization of 
international military tribunal 
to try major European war 
criminals, 9 ' it was revealed yes- 
terday, 

In reporting- Rosenman's mis- 
sion, a U. S. State Department 
officer made clear it was in no 
way connected with U.N*C.I.O. 
but was being carried on here 
because of the presence _ of 
representatives of the nations 
concerned—the United King- 
dom, Russia, and France. 

The State Department officer 
said the purpose of Rosenman s 
visit was to establish machinery 
and setup procedure which will 
assure just and expeditious 
trials to major individuals and 
organizations of the Axis. 

Authoritative circles said the 
P« S. proposals called for organ- 
izations like the Gestapo to be 
tried through several of their 
Ming members. Then, if the 
leaders are found guilty, any- 
one who voluntarily accepted 
membership can be tried for 
belonging, regardless of his per- 
sonal >ole in crimes committed. 



Reds Say Goebbels' Body Found 



London— The Russians in 
Berlin Wednesday found 
bodies identified with "with 
fair certainty" as Nazi Pro- 
paganda Minister Paul Goeb- 
bels and his family and that 
of Martin Bormann, successor 
to Rudolph Hess as Hitler's 
deputy, a dispatch said. 

Meanwhile, Nazi war crimi- 
nals and others suspected of 
treasonable actions continued 
falling into Allied hands. 

Konrad Henlein, gauleiter 



of Sudetenland, and Dr. Karl 
H* Frank, Nazi military gov- 
ernor of Czechoslovakia, were 
captured and Gen, Maxime 
Wcygand, last commander-in- 
chief of France's army before 
the fall of the republic was 
arrested in France, The 
charges against Weygand 
were not stated. 

Anton Mussert, leader of 
Holland's Nazis, was also lock- 
ed up on treason charges to 
be tried before Dutch jurists. 



In Norway, Vidkun Quisling 
was in jail and Joseph Terbo-

THE FUTURE FOR JAPAN 

With Germany out of the war and Japan now standing 
completely alone against the whole world, the Japanese are 
naturally asking themselves if there is any alternative to the 
iea\h now being inflicted on their armed forces and the destruc- 
tion being wrought against their cities. 

The answer is yes. The alternative to unprecedented and 
entirely needless hardship and suffering is unconditional sur- 
render. And what does unconditional surrender mean? 
President Truman himself, speaking for the American people, has 
given the answer. 

"It means the end of the war/ 1 said the President of the 
United States in a statement issued Tuesday. "It means termi- 
nation of the influence of the military leaders who have brought 
Japan to the present brink of disaster. It means provision for 
the return of soldiers and sailors to their families, their farms, 
thetrjobs. . # 

' -It means not prolonging the present agony and suffering ot 
the Japanese in the vain hope of victory, or enslavement of the 
Japanese people.' 1 

The President's meaning is clear. Every Japanese should 
consider his words, and decide for himself which course will best 
serve the interest of Japan. 



Holland Urges 
Care in . hik to 
Right ^and Drive 

Col. J. P. Holland, chief of 
police and provost marshal of 
Manila, discussing the new 
traffic regulations to go into 
effect May 31 in this city, said 
yesterday: 

"At midnight on May 31 
the driving and walking 
habits of 18,000,000 people 
will be completely changed. All 
traffic will commence moving 
on the right side of the road. 

i "Manilans," Holland said, 
"must do their part to make 
the problem as light as possi- 
ble. They must give the 
civilian drivers and pedes- 
trians a break by not rushing 
them but driving slowly and 
safely." 

Holland emphasized that the 
right of way must be given to 
the other person when an 
emergency arises, and he 
warned against excessive 
horn-honking which adds to 
confusion as well as makes it. 
His advice is to use brakes, 
when necessary, instead of 
the horn. 

Most important, Holland 
said, was to reduce the speed 
of a car below the legal speed 
until careful driving becomes 
a habit.

Moscow — As 190,000,000 Russians joyously cele- 
brated the victory over Germany Wednesday, thousands 
of wildly demonstrating Muscovites gathered in front of 
the United States embassy shouting "Long Live Ameri- 
ca! Long Live Truman! Long "Live the memory of 
Roosevelt! Long live the great American people !" in 
the greatest spontaneous tribute to the United States 
ever staged here. 

U. S. Officers and non-coms 
and members of the diplomatic 
staff flocked out of the embassy 
to join the demonstration. Rus- 
sians kissed them, beat them on 
the backs, and lifted them into 
the air. A wave of enthusiasm 
swept the crowd when the Soviet 
flag was hung besides the Unit- 
ed States flag. 

Uri Levi tan, the announcer 
who has broadcast all of Mar- 
shal Stalin's orders of the day 
over the Moscow radio, gave the 
nation the news of the German 
surrender at Berlin. 

Most of Moscow's residents 
were asleep but the announce- 
ment acted like an alarm clock. 
Thousands poured into the 
streets, many still clad in pa- 
jamas and night gowns. Chil- 
dren ran up and down the 
streets shouting "Victory! 
Victory!" Many people wept 
openly. Some fell on their 
knees in prayer. 
By daybreak, every man and 
woman and cjhild in Moscow 
who could walk had turned out 
• to celebrate the end of the 
European war. 

As dawn began to break, large 
«roups of planes appeared over 
the capital and began "buzzing;" 
citv streets in which Red flags 
were appearing everywhere. 

The celebrations in Moscow 
were typical, of the jubilation 
throughout the Soviet Union. 
I The Associated Press said 



Levitan's radio announcement 
that the Germans had surrend- 
ered to the Soviet Union and 
her Allies in Berlin was the 
first word the Russian people 
had of the surrender. 

No dispatches on the earlier 
surrender at Eisenhower's 
headquarters and celebrations 
in Britain and the U.S. had 
been broadcast or published. 

As Russians in flag-bedecked 
streets of Moscow were cele- 
brating, the Soviet radio re- 
emphasized the Russian govern- 
ment's determination to preserve 
full collaboration between the 
Allies. 

A commentator said: "The 
struggle which has just ended 
victoriously was in a full sense 
of the word a struggle to pre- 
serve European and world civil- 
ization. 

"The Soviet government is 
anxious to collaborate to the 
full with other governments in 
arranging for a really worthy 
peace and for establishing a 
world organization capable of 
nipping aggression in the bud." 



Confesor Cherts 
Plans to Hike

The main objective of tl 
Emergency Control Administr: 
tion is to enable the people 1 
purchase goods of prime nece: 
sity at a fair and reasonab: 
price, declared ECA Admini: 
trator Tomas Confesor in a 
interview. When the ECA take 
over the PCAU stores in th 
city and eventually in all libe 
rated areas, it will not onl; 
extend the same services am 
goods to the people but take th 
people into active participate 
in the management of the store? 
The ECA stores will be people'; 
stores, he said. 

The main problems confront 
ing the ECA are supply, trans 
portation and distribution saic 
Confesor. The ECA propose- 
to solve the problem of suppb 
jointly with that of transporta- 
tion. Aside from trucks W

3 Price Control 
Agents Accused 
Of Taking Bribe 

Deogracias Castaneda, Felipe 
Alonso and Donato Joaquin , 
agents of the former price con- 
trol division of the office of the 
Provost Marshal, were accused 
Thursday of bribery, in the 
Manila court of first instance. 

According to a criminal com- 
plaint filed by Eriberto Barot 7 
assistant city prosecuting at- 
torney, Castafieda, Alonso and 
Joaquin, conspired together, 
helped one another and took a 
bribe in the amount of P120 
from Tomasa Santos, a meat 
vendor residing: at 735 Calle 
Coromina, Quiapo, on March 
28, 1945. 

The complaint further states 
that the trio caught Tomasa 
selling carabao moat at profi- 
teering prices, and accepted a 
bribe of P120 from Tomasa. 

The trio are out on bail* 



♦ Washington— Most of the 3,500,000 American 
soldiers now in Europe are expected to be re-deployed 
homeward or Pacificward in slightly less than one year 
with the exception of a garrison- force of approximately 
400,000, it was announced Wednesday by General 
Erehon B, Somervell, commanding general of Army 
Service- Forces. ® — — 



The announcement was made 
at a War Department press 
conference on logistics and the 
transportation program for re- 
deployment of U. S, forces from 
European to the Pacific. 

Maj. Gen. Charles P. Gross, 
chief of the Transportation 
Corps, assisting Somervell, 
added : 

"At this time it cannot be 
stated how many of the 3,100,* 
000 to be drawn from Europe 
eventually will be transferred to 
the Pacific, but several months 
must necessarily elapse before 
Japan feels the full force of 
American might 

"This is the half-way mark. 
Prom the supply and transport- 
ation standpoint, the hardest 
part of the struggle still looms 
ahead." 

Somervell revealed that the 
bulk of the troops transferred 
from Europe will be routed 
through the TL S. Each service- 
man will receive a 30-day fur- 
lough within a week to 10 days 
after arriving in the States, 

Gross said that the with- 
drawal was expected to be at 
the rate of approximately. 280,- 
000 monthly during the first 
three months. 305,000 a month 
are estimated to be transferred 
during the second quarter, and 
a little under 70,000 monthly 
thereafter until only the gar- 
rison remains in Europe. 

Gross said that the Air 
Transport Command could carry 
some 50,000 men monthly from 
Europe, meaning a bulk of the 
movement would be by water. 

Somervell emphasized the 
geographic pattern of the Paci- 
fic theater operations create 
new problems which must be 
met and overcome. New bases 



must be established to accom- 
modate augmented striking 
forces. Specialists in these 
problems, he said, are already 
en route to the Pacific from 
Europe, 

Maj. Gen. Walter A. Wood, 
also assisting Somervell, dis- 
cussing the redistribution of 
men and material, cited two 
basic problems: The total 
amount recoverable from 
Europe; and the amount of 
time necessary to make this re- 
coverable property available- 
Howard Bruce, Army Service 
Forces director of material, 
discussing the task of flattening 
out the production curve to 
avoid "peaks and valleys," said, 
"this has been an extremely 
difficult undertaking. Require- 
ments since D-Day have been 
subject to wide and unpredict- 
able fluctuation." 

Bruce declared previous pro- 
duction plans had conformed to 
progress made in the Pacific. A 
new program was evolved in 
February with the closest 
cooperation of the War Produc- 
tion Board, with management 
and labor being informed as 
soon as plans were agreed upon.

Pair Charged With Falsifying PC 'U Records 

Ismacl Reyes y Guzman and Elcutcrio Bautista, manager and 
assistant manager of PCAU 1-9, were accused Thursday in the 
Manila court of first instance of cztafa through falsification of 
official documents. 

In their regular reports to PCAU 1 headquarters, Reyes 

■ — <£and Bautista, both residents of 

Arayat St., Quezon City, suc- 
ceeded in withholding 4,536 
chupas of rice and 1,615 tins 
of sardines, amounting to more 
than P2,000, from February 19 
to March 31, according to in- 
formation filed by Julio 
Villamor, assistant city prose- 
cuting attorney. 

Villamor charged that Reyes 
and Bsutista, during that 
period, received rice and sar- 
dines from PCAU 1 for distri- 
bution, but withheld it. In their 
report, however, they listed dis- 
tribution to relief card holders 
numbering more than 200 on 
certain specified dates, Villamor 
said. 

Investigation was begun 
when families in the district 
complained to PCAU 1 head- 
quarters that they had not been 
receiving their regular rations..

once the hub of the continent's

Zkukov paid his tribute to the 
supreme commander ot me 
forces of the western allies 
during a banquet held in the 
?Sm *hei B the ratification 
took Place, saying he wanted 
Eisenhower "to know how much 
the Soviet army and people j ap- 
preciate his tremendous achieve- 
ments." The Red Army leader 
X toasted the late Resident 
Roosevelt, Howard Smith of the 
Columbia broadcasting company 
reported in a Paris broadcast 

Zlmkov's first toast at the 
dinner, attended by Soviet staff 
officers and Supreme Head- 
quarters Allied Expeditionary 
Force delegates and Allied news- 
papermen, was for -victory 
peace and Marshal Stalin. His 
second toast was for Eisen- 
how 61* 

Smith broadcast: "Zhukov 
silent, became expansive. He 
seemed to be as happy as a kid 
on Christmas day. He embraced 
Gen. Spnatz. After one toast 
he turned his fflass upside down 
in front of Marshal Tedder to 
show that he had downed it all 
in one gulp and that Marshal 
Tedder do likewise/' 

Allied Air Marshal Tedder 
toasted Allied unity, Harold 
King, Reuters, reported. Tedder 
said : "Here we are in the rums

"Despite all the trouble the 

enemy took trying to divide us

Editors Urge 
Harsh Peace 
For Germany 

NEW York— American editors 
and publishers who went to 
Europe at the invitation of Gen. 
Eisenhower to view the horrors 
of German concentration camps 
returned to New York, yester- 
day, convinced that peace terms 
for Germany must be harsh. 

Spokesmen for fifteen of the 
original IS newspapermen who 
went abroad said all reports of 
the horrors perpetrated in con- 
centration camps at Dachau and 
Buchenwald we're "all too true". 

Joseph Pulitzer, editor and 
publisher of the St Louis Fost- 
Dispatch, voiced the sentiments 
of his colleagues when he said: 
"We were asked to go there to 
verify conditions reported in 
the press. We found they were 
not exaggerated* As a matter 
of fact, they were understated* 
I am for a just, but a very 
severe peace as far as the Ger- 
mans are concerned." 



'German women and child- 
ren and old men were clear- 
ing paths. There are no young 
Germans left in Berlin. Civil- 
ians moved abruptly, carrying 
bricks by hand. 

"We threaded a narrow lane 
between the walls of debris, 
going several blocks before we 
saw a sign revealing we were 
on Wilhelmstrasse. Some 
hunks of buildings were still 
on fire.

"The scarred walls and hil- 
lock of muddy masonry of the 
Reich Chancellory, on the left 
side of Wilheimplatz, still 
smelled of battle. Empty 
windows gaped in the fm- 
scorched facade. Part of the 
roof had fallen in. 

"Allied flags flew over this 
seat of government for the 
Reich that Hitler predicted 
would last 1,000 years, 
"Unter Den Linden, where 



nitler held his victory 
parades, was a mass of twist-

the Germans differently and 
pointed out that "Germany was 
not occupied in 1918 but now it 
is entirely overrun by troops of 
the Allies."

Point System Announced 
For U. S. Army Discharges 



Washington — In the wake 
of victory in Europe, the War 
Department announced its 
point system to govern release 
of enlisted personnel under 
partial demobilization plans. 

About 1,300,000 men will be 
let out during the next 12 
months. The normal attri- 
tion rate of discharges and 
other factors will bring the 
total released from service 
during that year to about 
2,000,000. 

Mai Gen. W + J. Tompkins, 
War Department special staff 
director, said* however, selec- 
tive service calls will be kept 
at present levels which were 



fixed on a replacement basis. 
Bulk of men drafted will be 
from the 18-year olds, while 
some will be over 30 and pos- 
sibly fathers. Enlistment of 
general service Wacs will con- 
tinue. 

Because of special require- 
ments of Pacific warfare, 
strength of Army Service and 
Air Forces will be reduced 
much less than other branches. 

The point system governing 
eligibility for discharge is 
figured on service credit, over- 
seas duty, participation in 
combat, and parenthood- A 
minimum score of 85 points 
will be required.

MacArthur Pays Tribute To 5,000 Wacs In SWPA 



General MacArthur, in a 
tribute to the Women's Army 
Corps on the occasion of its 
third anniversary today, de- 
scribed the 5,000 khaki-clad 
women now serving in the 
Southwe it Pacific area as 
"good and faithful soldiers m 
the onward march to victory/ 
Grown to a strength of 
nearly 100,000 women in uni- 
form, the WAC now serves 



throughout the United States 
and foreign theaters, with 
more than 15,000 overseas, 

WACs in the Southwest 
Pacific area are scattered in 
14 detachments" from Austra- 
lia to Manila through New 
Guinea, the Netherlands East 
Indies, and Leyte. 

General MacArthur, in 
whose command WACs have 
served now for one year, 



issued the following state- 
ment: 

"Total victory in modern 
war requires the mobilization 
of all our human and material 
resources, the complete effort 
and relentless energy of all 
the people* In the factory, on 
the farm, and in the armed 
forces, women everywhere 
have taken the place of men 
called to combat and shoul- 



dered their burdens with un- 
flinching courage and out- 
standing ability. Never be- 
fore in the history of America 
have they made such a prodi- 
gious military contribution. 

"Many have chosen to serve 
their country in the armed 
forces, thus releasing thou- 
sands of troops for field duty. 
Here in the Southwest Pacific 
they have endured the hard- 



ships of war with the same 
stout-hearted fortitude and 
typically American good 
humor as their brothers in 
arms, 

"I congratulate the Women's 
Army Corps on this, its 
third anniversary. Its mem- 
bers are £ood and faithful 
soldiers in the onward march 
to victory/'

Russians Reduce Berlin To 'Smoking Chao 



8 



Berlin— (Delayed) —John 
Groth of the Associated Press 
describing the ruin of Berlin 
as <f a broken smoking chaos" 
after its capture by the Rus- 
sians, said in part: 

"For miles around stretched 
immense mounds of debris of 
what bad been a city of 4,000,- 
000 people, 

"The Templehof airdrome, 
once the hub of the continent's 
airways, was a skeleton of 



hangars and buildings, 

"Smashed, overturned street 
cars showed where enemy 
barricades had been crushed 
by the Russian assaults, 

"I had to enquire of a Ger- 
man civilian to identify the 
Belle Alliance Platz which I 
once knew well, with streets 
radiating from it unrecogniz- 
able as streets. They were 
heaps of almost mountains 
of rubble. 



"German women and child- 
ren and old men were clear- 
ing paths. There are no young 
Germans left in Berlin. Civil- 
ians moved abruptly, carrying 
bricks by hand* 

"We threaded a narrow lane 
between the walls of debris, 
going several blocks before we 
saw a sign revealing we were 
on Wilhclmstrasse. Some 
hunks of buildings were still 
on fire. 



"The scarred walls and hil- 
lock of muddy masonry of the 
Keich Chancellory, on the left 
side of Wilhelmplatz, still 
smelled of battle. Empty 
windows gaped in the lire- 
scorched facade. Part of the 
roof had fallen in. 

"Allied flags flew over this 
seat of government for; the 
Reich that Hitler predicted 
would last 1,000 years, 
"Unter Den Linden, where 



nitler held his v ;. 
parades, was a mass of ixfi 
ed vehicles. Up the J* 
came a bedraggled 
war prisoners and (knL 
carrying stretchers JS? 
bodies on them, 

"Everywhere German & . 
and women were aweeni 
and cleaning under the !"■ 
of Russians. The street it - 
was strewn with land 
dug up by the Red arm 



Zhukov Ranks Eisenhower As 
Among Greatest Of Generals 

Berlin— Marshal Gregory Zhukov, deputy com- 
mander in chief of the Russian army and signatory for 
the Soviet Union at the ratification of Germany's sur- 
render, shortly after the ceremony Wednesday lauded 
Gen, Bwig'ht Eisenhower as "one of the greatest gen- 
erals of all time and one of America's outstanding sons", 
dispatches said. $ — — - 



Zhukov paid his tribute to the 
supreme commander of the 
forces of the western allies 
during a banquet held in the 
room where the ratification 
took place, saying he wanted 
Eisenhower "to know how much 
the Soviet army and people ap- 
preciate his tremendous achieve- 
ments." The Red Army leader 
also toasted the late President 
Roosevelt, Howard Smith of the 
Columbia broadcasting company 
reported in a Paris broadcast 

Zhiikov ! s first toast at the 
dinner, attended by Soviet staff 
officers and Supreme Head- 
quarters Allied Expeditionary 
Force delegates and Allied news- 
paper men, was for victory, 
peace and Marshal Stanm His 
second toast was for Eisen- 
hower, 

Smith broadcast: "Zhukov 
silent, became expansive. He 
seemed to be as happy as a kid 
on Christmas day* He embraced 
Gen. Spaatz. After one toast 
he turned his glass upside down 
in front of Marshal Tedder to 
show that he had downed it all 
in one gulp and that Marshal 
Tedder do likewise/' 

Allied Air Marshal Tedder 
toasted Allied unity, Harold 
King, Reuters, reported. Tedder 
said : "Here we are in the ruins 
of Berlin and the biggest ruin 
has been that of the power 
represented at that table an hour 
or two ago, 

"Despite all the trouble the 
enemy took trying to divide us 
and trying to start arguments 
between us, we have gotten to 
Berlin together. 

"May we be Allies in peace as 
well as in war and win that 
victory that matters more than 
anything else— the victory of 
peace,"

Editors Urge 
Harsh Peace 
For Germany 

New York — American editors 
and publishers who went to 
Europe at the invitation of Gen. 
Eisenhower to view the horrors 
of German concentration camps 
returned to New York, yester- 
day, convinced that peace terms 
for Germany must be harsh. 

Spokesmen for fifteen of the 
original 18 newspapermen who 
went abroad said all reports of 
the horrors perpetrated in con- 
centration camps at Dachau and 
Buchenwald were "all too true", 

Joseph Pulitzer, editor and 
publisher of the St, Louis Post- 
Dispatch, voiced the sentiments 
of his colleagues when he said: 

"We were asked to go there to 
verify conditions reported in 
the press. We found they were 
not exaggerated. As a matter 
of fact, they were understated, 
I am for a just, but a very 
severe peace as far as the Ger- 
mans are concerned." 

Norman Chandler, publisher 
of the Los Angeles Times % said : 
"I would say that the peace 
terms couldn't be too severe." 

Gideon Seymour, executive 
editor of the Minneapolis Star- 
Jmmmt said: "We've got to 
police Germany for the next 20 
years if the American people 
will stand for it." 



US, Takes Over 
German Embassy 
And Consulates 

Washington — The United 
States is taking over the Ger- 
man embassy in Washington 
and German consulates else- 
where in the country together 
with their contents, acting Sec- 
retary of State Joseph C. Grew 
announced Tuesday. 

Grew said the Swiss lega- 
tion, which has been in charge 
of German interests in the U. S. 
since December, 1341, had been 
requested to turn over to the 
State Department all German 
premises, archives and property 
under its protection. 

In taking this step, Grew 
pointed out that the war in 
Europe had ended, Germany is 
defeated and has surrendered 
unconditionally. He asserted 
that there was no further neces- 
sity for any representation of 
the German government in U. S. 

Grew said that the property 
would be held in trust, that 
such archives as may remain 
will be carefully preserved, and 
that no documents will be 
destroyed pr removed. 



House Wants Voice 
On Treaty Approvals 

Washington— The House of 
Representatives Tuesday passed 
a resolution submitting to the 
States a constitutional amend- 
ment requiring ratification of 
treaties by majority votes of 
both the Senate and the House. 
The House resolution passed by 
a vote of 293 to 88. 

The Constitution now provides 
for a treaty ratification by two- 
thirds vote of the Senate, with 
the House having no voice at all. 

Political observers said indi- 
cations were that the Senate 
would turn down the House 
proposal. 



Point System Announced 
For U. S. Army Discharges 



Washington— In the wake 
of victory in Europe, the War 
Department announced its 
point system to govern release 
of enlisted personnel under 
partial demobilization plans. 

About 1,300,000 men will be 
let out during the next 12 
months. The normal attri- 
tion rate of discharges and 
other factors will bring the 
total released from service 
during that year to about 
2,000,000, 

Mai. Gen. W, J. Tompki ns. 
War Department special staff 
director, said, however, selec- 
tive service calls will be kept 
at present levels which were 



fixed on a replacement basis. 
Bulk of men drafted will be 
from the 18-year olds, while 
some will be over 30 and pos- 
sibly fathers. Enlistment of 
genera) service Wacs will con- 
tinue. 

Because of special require- 
ments of Pacific warfare, 
strength of Army Service and 
Air Forces will be reduced 
much less than other branches. 

The point system governing 
eligibility for discharge is 
figured on service credit, over- 
seas duty y participation in 
combat, and parenthood. A 
minimum score of 85 points 
will be required* 



Nazis Can't Revive 
World War I Excuse 

London — Prime Minister 
Churchill Wednesday told the 
House of Commons that the 
German people should now be 
convinced their army has been 
thoroughly beaten in the field. 

Churchill expressed doubt 
whether any future propagand- 
ist mi^ht be able to convince 
the Germans differently and 
pointed out that ''Germany was 
not occupied in 1918 but now it 
is entirely overrun by troops of 
the Allies."

UNITY REMAINS 



Last week Russia celebrated V-E Day with a nation-wide 
holiday. It was well earned. The terrible blood-letting Inflicted 
on Germany by^the mighty Russian armies was a decisive factor 
in the final collapse of Nazi militarism. Russia has sustained 
greater casualties and more wide-spread destruction than any 
of the other United Nations* 

But in all probability Russia will not rest on her laurels. 
Despite her tremendous losses she is looking forward to the 
completion of the war— which will not be over until Japan is 
beaten— and fo the peace which will follow. 

A few days ago a Russian government spokesman said 
significantly, "The Soviet government is anxious to collaborate 
to the full with other governments In arranging for a really 
worthy peace and for establishing a world organization capable 
of nipping aggression in the bud/' 

The overthrow of German militarism has not affected the 
cooperation so long evident between the United Nations, The 
Axis dream of dividing the Allies has been shattered. Unity 
between the United States, Great Britain, Russia and China was 
never more of a fact than it is today.

War's Length Termed 
Largely up to Japs 

Washington— Senator Elbart 
D. Thomas of Utah said last 
week that the progress of the 
second phase of the war which 
now centers upon Japan will be 
determined, to a large extent, 
by the military element in that 
country. 

"In fighting the Japanese 
war", Thomas said, "we are 
fighting as many wars as there 
are theaters and Japanese gen- 
erals. If we have to get every 
Japanese general as we did in 
China it will take a long time. 
However, we have not been go- 
ing at all slowly in the Pacific 
■when you think of the enormous 
distances involved," 



30,000 Sacks of Rice

from the office of Secretary of

Plan Mapped 
To Increase 
Fcod Output 

In view of the poor rice and 
corn harvest this year, Secre- 
tary of the Interior Tomas' Con- 
fesor announced last week that 
he will issue instructions to the 
different provincial governors 
to launch intensive food produc- 
tion campaigns." 

"The inadequacy of rood sup- 
ply has been the source of eco- 
nomic dislocation in the coun- 
try," Confesor said- "In order 
to relieve America of the bur- 
den of feeding- us and help her 
win the war, it is imperative 
that our people step up produc- 
tion of rice, corn, fruits, vege- 
tables, poultry and livestock." 

Confesor will assign the pro- 
vincial chief executives to be 
food administrators in their 
provinces/ the agricultural su- 
pervisor as executive officer and 
the town mayor as municipal 
food supervisor. 

"The production of more food 
will not only increase the reve- 
nue of each province but. also 
curb profiteering," Confesor 
said.

Arnold Discloses Super Forts 
Mine Waters Off West japan 

WASHINGTON— U. S. Army Air Forces Commander Henry H. Arnold an- 
nounced Friday that the 20th Air Force had engaged in 19 mine-laying operations 
in Pacific waters during the first 11 months of its history. Security reasons, he 
added, prevented disclosure of this type of operation by Superfortresses of the 20th 

and 21st Bomber Commands. f

ed industrial plants to opera- 
tions, it was announced yester- 
day. 

The chamber has asked lum- 
ber, rice, and oil mills and soap 
factories to furnish data on the 
spare parts required and on 
their fuel requirements. 

Soap manufacturers were 
also asked to list necessary im- 
ported ingredients. Owners of

largest single mining operation 
ever undertaken by aircraft 
men. That was when the 21st 
Bomber Command late in March 
mined the coastal waters of 
western Japan in support of the 
landing operation on Okinawa. 
Hundreds of tons of mines were 
also planted by planes in other 
enemy waters on this mission. 

Another outstanding oper- 
ation, Arnold remarked, was 
performed by the 20th Bomber 
Command which flew from bases 
in India last January to carry 
out large scale mining oper- 
ations against the entrance to 
Singapore Harbor and adjacent 
waters, 

The 20th Air- Force mining 
operations have been of two gen- 
eral types. The first was aimed 
at cutting enemy shipping lines 
in support of broad strategic 
objectives. The other was of a 
tactical character. 

These mine operations, have 
extended over almost the entire 
field of war in the Pacific, from 
Singapore to the Japanese 
homeland, Arnold said. 

The mines were provided by 
the Navy, it was revealed.

from the barrios, Alvarez said, 
either being killed or fleeing to 
the mountains. 

Business conditions are fair 
although goods and foodstuffs 
are sold at profiteering prices 
in the black market. Farmers 
throughout the province have 
started planting rice and corn 
and there is a good prospect of 
a plentiful harvest. Lumber- 
ing and fishing are gaining im- 
petus and the army is provid- 
ing jobs for laborers. Alvarez 
added that the PCAU unit in

Kaiser Sees Security Conference 
As Chance to Work Out Just World 

San Francisco — Henry J. Kaiser, most famous 
industrialist of this war, whose offices look down on the 
world peace conference, Tuesday declared that he "holds 
a deep conviction that any problem, regardless of diffi- 
culties, can be worked out" and that "patience, perse- 
verance and all the qualities necessary to solve this 
particular problem are appearing daily in the characters 
of the individuals responsible for this conference." 



Kaiser said: "I watch the 
security conference with the 
deepest hope that the distin- 
guished delegates from nations 
great and small may achieve 
harmony, and that they actually 
will arrive at a working organ- 
ization." 

The industrialist called parti- 
cular attention to a statement 
made by Clement Attlee, Deputy 
Prime Minister of Great Britain, 
in a press interview just before 
the opening of the peace con- 
ference. 

Attlee told correspondents 
that the people of his city of 
Stepney — a ruined city on the 
lower Thames, were not interest- 
ed in legal technicalities and 
procedures here at San Fran- 
cisco. What they wanted to 
know was whether Stepney, 
when it was rebuilt, would be 
underground and bomb-proof or 
above ground in the sunlight, 
with the advantages which 
modern construction could offer. 

"That question, though it 
comes from a single city," said 
Kaiser, "represents the problem 
of all of us. Are we to have 
peace effectively maintained by 
a world organization, or are wc 
to devote our building capacity 
to war?" 

"Putting it in the most pos- 
sible blunt words," continued 
Kaiser, "are the Kaiser indus- 
tries, and all the other industries 
of the country, to produce ships, 
steel, magnesium, aluminum 
and plastics for another war 
or are we to produce them for 
the enrichment of mankind?" 

Kaiser asked, '"Are we to 
build highways, health centers, 
new homes, light metal trains, 
light metal busses and great 
cargo planes for the betterment 
of all the people or are we to 
construct weapons for destruc- 
tion?" 

Piling up the question, the 
man who built a Liberty ship 
in about four days, asked, "Are 
we to rob the surface of the 
earth of its woods, minerals, 



and other age-old secretions foi 
the purpose of fighting one an- 
other, or are we to employ these 
resources for the future of the 
people of the world?" 

Kaiser concluded: "It is the 
history of tomorrow which this 
conference is determining. One 
could not possibly exaggerate 
the importance of the decisions 
reached here. It is a question 
of whether the world shall 
devote its resources and genius 
to war and misery or to peace 
and creativeness." 



Warning Renewed 
On House Rentals 

House rentals within Greater 
Manila may not exceed 125 
percent of the rates prevailing 
during the last six months of 
1941, Secretary of Interior and 
ECA Administrator Tomas Con- 
fesor again warned yesterday. 
House owners are given 30 days 
to report their house rentals to 
the Committee for the Control 
of House Rentals. 

City Assessor Fidel A. Reyes, 
as chairman, and City Engineer 
H. R. Reyes and Mr. Vicente 
Arias, as members, compose the 
committee. It will act on all 
complaints about unauthorized 
increase in rentals. 



Engineer To Check 
Nueva Ecija Water 

Sanitary Engineer Pastor 
Echavez was reported leaving 
today to investigate the water 
supply of Cabanatuan, Nueva 
Ecija, which was reported by 
Gov. Juan Chioco to be unsafe 
for drinking. He informed 
health officials that U. S. Army 
medical officers had found the 
water not fit to drink. 

Health conditions in Nueva 
Ecija, Chioco said, are well 
controlled by public dispen- 
s ries and hospitals established 
by PCAU.

Japs to Put Out 
Peace Feelers, 
Halsey Warns 

Somewhere in the Pacific — 
Admiral William F. Halsey, 
predicting that Japan will put 
out strong peace feelers in the 
near future, said last week "it 
would bo criminal not to fight 
this war through to its success- 
ful conclusion." 

Speaking before Anny, Navy 
and Marine chaplains of «thc 
Pacific Ocean area, Halsey said: 

"There Will be pressure 
brought to bear to accept this 
peace from parents at home 
who want to save the lives of 
their sons and other loved ones, 
but we must think also of our 
grand children as well as of our 
children." 



Frightened Goering Tries 
Blame on Hitler to Save 



to Shift 
Own Skin 



Augsburg, Germany— Heichs- 
marshal Hermann Goering, 
facing Allied trial as No, 2 Nazi 
leader and war criminal, was 
painted as a "thoroughly fright- 
ened man frantically striving to 
shift blame for everything on 
Adolf Hitler and others in an 
effort to save his own skin," by 
Pierre Huss of International 
News Service Saturday. 

Goering gave the impression 
of being "willing to sell any of 
his old Nazi pals down the river 
to save his own life," according 
to Jack Fleischer, United Press. 
Commenting on the end of the 
European war, Goering said:

Uncover New 
Nazi Horrors 

New York — Another German 
horror camp at Ebensee, near 
Salzburg-, which "rivals and 
even exceeds in horror the 
camps at Buchenwald and 
Dachau" was discovered by U. S. 
Seventh Army troops, prank 
Gillard of the British' Broad- 
casting Company reported yes- 
terday. 

Gillard said that "only one 
out of every five prisoners in- 
terned had a chance of re- 
covery/' adding that when the 
troops arrived "600 people were 
dying every day and that con- 
ditions were so bad that at first 
we could do little to help. 1 ' 

Gillard revealed that "pris- 
oners in the camp were given 
one small cup of potato gruel 
every day. It was the only food 
thev got and they had to work 
in "salt mines. When they be- 
came too weak to work they 
were transferred to the so-called 
hospital area. There, they had 
to carry bodies of their com- 
rades to furnaces until they, too, 
dropped down and died."

"On the evening of April 22, 
certain events occurred at tM 
Chancellory and ^^^ lt ^ 
that it was the end of the w.u

Warning Given 
On Explosives 

Manila — There is still a 
tremendous quantity of Jap-

t^nslf fire bombs yesterday on 
Nagoya, Japan's third large&t

THESE CHANGING TIMES 

History has been written so swiftly these past few days, that 
itjis difficult to weigh just how far and how fast the United 
Nations have traveled along the road to complete victory/ A 
better way to jud9@ today's events is to go bade a year* 

One year ago, Tokyo Radio was saying; "Island to island 
tactics of MaeArthur will take almost 50 years to reach Japan* 
We are smashing all attempts of the Americans to retake the 
Pacific islands. The Japanese Navy remains intact. It is only 
waiting time and opportunity." 

One year ago, General Mac Arthur's forces were fighting 
in New Guinea, Germany was a potent ally of Japan. The 
Americans had not yet landed in France. The Philippines were 
firmly under Japan's thumb. Tokyo had not yet felt the lash of 
Super Fortresses. 

Today, Japan stands atone. With the exception of badly 
mauled Japanese garrisons on Mindanao and Luzon, the Philip- 
pines has been entirely liberated. The American flag flies on 
Okinawa, 350 miles south of Kyushu, and from Iwo Jlma, 650 
miles^ below Tokyo. Over 31 square miles of fire*bfackened 
debris in the heart of the Japanese capital bear testimony to 
out B-29 assaults. 

Today, Tokyo Radio sings a different tune: "From the very 
beginning/' a Tokyo apologist said Saturday, "the Asia war'was 
forced upon us without choice." He further underscored Japans 
weakened position in these words; 

"Now that Germany has laid down her arms, Japan must 
single-handedly face her enemy. We cannot deny that 
America's position has been eased by completion of the 
European war, while on the other hand, we have been placed 
in a tougher situation." 

Today, in Japan, even the humblest peasant knows that the 
time if will take for General MaeArthur to reach the homeland 
no longer is measured in terms of "years." 



U,S. to Abandon Controls 
On Flow of Vital Materials 

Washington— The Combined Raw Materials Board 
Sunday announced it wag following; a policy of terminat- 
ing its controls so that "they do not continue to impose 
upon the normal flow of commerce," a restrictive pat- 
tern no longer justified by the needs of the war effort. 

The board said that despite 



PC AO 4 Hospital 
Treats 200 Daily 

Although the ktaff of Public 
Hospital PCAU 4 located at the 
eon7!?r of Tocson and T* 
Envmihaw streets has recently 
been reduced, it is still handling 
the same volume of cases which 
average 200 dispensary treat- 
men Ik every day as well as 
tVom 75 to 100 bed patients. 

Army cots are also available 
at all times to serve emergency 
cases. The hospital is within 
easy roach by laborers who 
figure in minor accidents at the 
nearby Army camps. The hos- 
pital also serves indigent resi- 
dents from Tondo, Mtvypajo, 
Galoocan, Sm Nicolas, and Na- 
v otas and Malabon, Itizal, 

Tho present staff of the hos- 
pital consist of 6 physicians, in- 
cluding the director, one den- 
tist, one pharmacist, five re- 
gistered nurses and 2§ atten- 
dants, \ 



the general easing- of the world 
supply in raw materials, cer- 
tain important materials, includ- 
ing natural rubber, hides, lead, 
lumber, pulp and paper would 
continue to be scarce for some 
time, 

In addition to continuing mil- 
itary needs, the minimum de- 
mands of liberated areas are 
becoming increasingly impor- 
tant, it said. 

The board said that liberated 
countries were collaborating 
with combined supply authori- 
ties to arrange their imports of 
scarce materials and to mini- 
mize conflict with war demands.

tiffed by the U. S. State 

partment through Switzer- 
land that only one person sur- 
vived the sinking of the J ap- 

• ship, believed to be the 
Awa Maru. 

The Awa Maru was a relief 
ship returning to Japan after 
carrying supplies to Allied pris- 
oner's in Japanese occupied 
areas. It carried no lights and 

. 40 miles off its estimated 
coarse when mistakenly sunk by 
: -rican submarine April 1. 

The Japanese subsequently 
announced a number of high 
Japanese officials had been 
aboard the Awa Maru and

Mandaluyong Hospital, will 
cover 1,300 acres and consist of 
840 separate buildings, have an 
adjoining airstrip with a 5,000 
foot runway, the use of 80 septic 
tanks and laundry facilities for 
15,000 people. 

The hospital will have its own 
ice plant with 16 tons capacity 
daily. One million gallons of 
water daily will' be required 
with provisions for a peak con- 
sumption of 100,000 gallons an 
hour. The project, will have its 
own electrical system — a series 
of small generators, each capa- 
able of assuming a 100 percent 
greater load than it normally 
carries, thus eliminating the 
possibility of current failure. 
Some 5,000 gallons of paint will 
be used to complete the Red- 
Grosses on the roofs alone. 

Before the entire construction 
job is completed, "the following 
amounts of material will be 
used: 45,000 bags of cement, 
120,00*0 feet of water pipe, 100,- 
000 electric light bulbs, and 132 
miles of electric wiring. It will 
also have an APO address, be 
furnished with a teletype room 
and have its own telephone 
service under its own power and 
control. 

More than 2,000 Filipino la- 
borers are aiding the Engineer 
units. The 866th Engineer 
Aviation Battalion and the 
1871st Engineer Aviation Bat- 
talion are the only two units 
assigned to the tremendous 
construction task. 

The Engineer units set up a 
abor office to handle the civilian 
help and a mess hall to feed 
them. Arrangements were 
made for medical attention, and 
there were more than 300 cases 
a day, ranging from ulcers to 
pregnancy. The sick call is now 
down to 100 a day and dropping 

During the first two weeks 
of the work, the area was under 
continual artillery fire, some 
shells dropping 50 yards f 
the construction crews. 

Several empty pillboxes had 
to be blown up, an ammunition 
dump removed, and a number of 
Jap bombs dug out. 



Goering Has 
Eight Strikes 

London — Former Reichs- 
marshal Hermann Goering has 
been indicted on at least eight 
separate counts and "we have 
an airtight case," press dis- 
patches quoted a member of the 
United Nations War Crimes 
Commission as saying yester- 
day. 

The commissioner said evi- 
dence already compiled against 
Goering as a w T ar criminal filled 
several volumes, and all but one 
of the counts against him arose 
from his responsibility as 
minister of the reich for crim- 
inal policies laid down by the 
German government.

Pershing's Old Moro Guide 
Again Helps Yanks on Jolo 



With the 41st Div. at Jolo, 
P. I. — Tulawie Arolas — the man 
who served as Gen. Pershing's 
official guide and interpreter 
during the Sulu Archipelago 
campaign in 1911, has again 
offered his help to United 
States froops. Tulawie Arolas, 
57, is the former provisional 
governor of Jolo. 

Soon after the Yanks of the 
veteran 41st Division had broken 
Jap resistance on Jolo Island, 
Arolas met in conference with 
Gen. Jens A. Doe, division com- 
mander, and announced himself 
ready to help the Yanks in any 
way possible. 

After the Moro campaign, 
during which he was wounded 
by his own people, he was named 
by Gov.-Gen. Leonard Wood as 
a teacher of English in Moro 
schools. Later he was elected 
to the provincial board of Sulu 



and served as acting governor 
on occasions. When the Philip- 
pine government was establish- 
ed, he was named delegate to 
the Constitutional Assembly in 
Manila. 

Arolas gave active help to 
guerrilla forces on Jolo during 
the three years of Jap occupa-

Truman Charts 'Share-Fcoa' 
Plaa for Starving Mi lions 

WASHINGTON— President Truman said Sunday that ''we 
must and can fiad a way" to share the available American food 
supplies with the starving people in liberated Europe. 

The statement was in response to an appeal signed by leaders 
of 22 civic, religious, and farm labor organizations expressing 
their desire "to share our food with liberated people". The appeal 

was sent to the White House April 21. _ 

Truman, replying said: 
"I am greatly encouraged by 
your letter of April 21 which 
you transmitted to me several 
days ago. I am sure it must 
also encourage the United Na- 
tions representatives now meet- 
ing in San Francisco. Parti- 
cularly is this true of leaders 
of those nations laid waste by 




the destruction and brutality of 
the Nazi- Japanese tyranny. 

"No immediate means of 
giving hope to victims of this 
■tyranny can have so great an 
effect as sharing with them by 
the people of our country of the 
food supplies we have available." 

The President added that 
"backed by such spontaneous 
popular expression, we must 
and can find a way to share our 
food with others so badly in 
need,"

17,000 Feet Over City 



Guam — Super Fortress pilots returning from the 
greatest B-29 raid of the war Monday, reported sweep- 
ing devastation in Japan's third largest city of Nagoya, 
with a smoke column 17,000 feet high rising over the 
target area, 

More than 500 Super Forts unloaded over 4,500 
tons of incendiary bombs in the first daylight fire raid 
on Nagoya with the loss of only two planes, 

The air parade was more than 1,800 miles long, 
with the giant bombers swooping down at medium 
altitude in squadrons of 11 planes each. 

The first Super Forts. had flown to Honshu, dropped 
their fire bombs, and were 90 minutes enroute home 
when the last plane was taking off from bases in the 
Marianas. 

The air fleet struck Nagoya

ing a continuing two-day offen- 
sive bv 900 carrier based planes

planes came from two task for- 
ces, the unconfirmed enemy

A new type 6-pound fire 

bomb was carried Monday for 

almost every one of Nagoya'a 

teeming 1,500,000 inh&bU 

tanfe. Alt together, 1,165,000 

separate bombs were dropped. 

They explode seconds after 

hitting tne target, and spew 

flaming gasoline over a wide 

area. 

The general target area of 
Monday's attack was just west 
of the gigantic Mitsubishi 
engine works which was 90 per 
cent devastated in previous at- 
tacks, Five great circles in the 
northern sector of the city— nine 
square miles— were designated 
as target areas. 

They included the CMguSa 
factory of the Nagoya arsenal 
producing heavy ordnance, the

EDITOR IAL 

THE BALLOON EXPLODES 

As if the world needed further proof, event* of the last tew 
days should erase, once and for all the to-called "super-man 
myth which the Axis tried to sell to a good share of the world 
not so many months ago, and with some success. 

It is ironic that Mussolini, Hitler, Goebbels, Goenng, 
Himmler, and Quisling could not die like fighting men when 
their turn came. They were the men who extolled war. They 
*ere the men who used to prate so glowingly of dying for the 
fatherland. They were the men who sent thousands to death, 
to torture, to slavery. 

' Mussolini, who once urged Italians to "live dangerously, 
shouted "No! No!" and hid behind his mistress' sWrts when 
Italian patriots caught him in Milan* 

Hitler died a coward, reportedly by his own hand, In blazing 
Berlin, after dragging Germany through its worst defeat In 
history* Goebbels followed his fuehrer's example. 

tTow, we have Goering, the balloon-bodied, medaU 
wefghted, Nazi bully, whose communiques once gloated over 
the holocausts touched off among non-military objectives ill 
London by his beloved Luftwaffe* 

Today, the fat-carcassed No* 2 Nazi is In American hands, 
pictured by correspondents as a "thoroughly frightened man 
frantically striving to shift blame for everything on Adolf 
Hitler and others," in an effort to save his own vast expanse 
of skin* 

Tne record of these "super leaders" of "super men" in 
their darkest hour draws its own moral* It contrasts sharply 
with those, of Filipinos in Fort Santiago, with Americans on 
Sataan, with the thousands of nameless patriots in France, in 
Greece, In Poland who defied death for an old-fashioned idea 
like freedom; the people whom Hitler, Goering, Mussolini and 
Goebbels labelled as "soft, weak-willed constituents of decadent 
democracy." 

This should be a sound lesson for all those who were tempted 
to desert justice, principles, and ethics for the invigorating, new, 
"geMch-quick" way of life that Nazism and Fascism dangled 
as a substitute P . . 



With U.S. Third Army, 
Austria — American offi- 
cials disclosed here today 
that the greatest Nazi cache 
of looted art works of the 
war, valued at more than 
$500,000,000, has been re- 
covered by the U.S. Third 
Army from the salt mines 
near Alt Aussie, Austria,

He wrote: 

The entire art collection, 
stolen from Monte Cassino, still 
marked with labels reading "for

ring" was among the world 
famous objects salvaged by 
Americans* 

The famed Ghent ^ art was 
found deep in the mines. 
A staggering array of works 



by Rembrandt, Rubens, IfW

other treasured works, were 
brought to light as the loot was

periments of the Pacific war is being conducted by the 
military government on Okinawa. When we finally 
break through and overrun the last one-fourth of Oki-

These are specially trained offi-

Ilocos Sur while many civilians 
were massacred before libera- 
tion of the province by guer- 
rillas, according to Military 
Governor Pablo Pe Benito, who 
arrived recently in Manila, 

Gov. Pe Benito cited this 
case of the toivn of Santiago 
where no single structure re- 
mains standing today. He re- 
vealed that the whole town was 
burned in retaliation for the 
killing of one Japanese.

that Allied landings and con- 
sequent advances on the Euro* 
pean continent saved London in 
the nick of time from suffer- 
ing the same total destruction 
that befell Berlin, 

In addition he said, the Ger- 
mans were preparing to launch 
a new submarine fleet with new 
tactics which might have re- 
vived the U-boat blockade dan- 
ger to its 1942 high point. 

"There was one final danger 
from which the collapse of Ger- 
many has saved us," said 
Churchill, referring to the fly- 
ing bombs and rockets. He 
then gave praise to the air 
forces which "have vastly de- 
layed German preparations," - 
Churchill added: "But it was 
only when our armies cleaned 
up the continental coast and 
overran all points of discharge, 
when the Americans captured 
vast stores of rockets of all 
kinds near Leipzig, when prep- 
arations being made on the 
coast of France and Holland 
could be examined in detail that 
we knew how grave was the 
peril," 

Peril, he > explained, derived 
not only "from rockets and fly*

long range artillery which was 
being prepared against London

City Planning Chief Outlines 
Possible Changes in New Manila 



HEADS SEVENTH DIVISION 
—Urn. Gen, Archibald V, 
Arnold, (waring the one-star 
insignia of a brigadier general) 
commands the Seventh Infantry 
Division which landed on 
Okinawa. 



Bus Service 
Set This Week 

Manila bus service by the 
Civilian Emergency Transporta- 
tion will be inaugurated within 
the week, as soon as necessary 
personnel and tickets are obtain- 
ed, according to the Civilian 
Emergency Administration. A 
fare- of 10 eentavos has been set 
for each zone. One zone extends 
from the Quiapo Church to the 
perimeter of the city proper 
and another zone extends from 
the perimeter to the suburbs. 
The public is requested to have 
ready 10 centavo coins, other- 
wise change will be in the form 
of tickets. 

Truck drivers with at least 
one year experience may apply 
at the Boiler and Machinery 
Division, City Engineer's Office, 
located at the University of 
Manila building, Alejandro VI 
St Applications of conductors, 
auto mechanics and other posi- 
tions connected with the trans- 
portation service may also be 
filed with the same office. 



Chinese Envoy Waits 
For Osmena Meeting 

Chinese Consul General Mow- 
Lan Tuan, who arrived in 
Manila from Australia only last 
week to assume his post, is 
expected to fly back to Brisbane 
soon on an important mission 
for his government. He is 
scheduled to stay in Australia 
for at least a month before re- 
turning to Manila, 

The new Chinese Consul had 
planned originally to fly back 
to Australia after a few days 
visit in Manila but deferred his 
departure until after he has 
conferred with President Sergio 
Osmena and U, S. Senator 
Millard Ty dings, who are due 
in Manila shortly. 



WOMEN TO MEET 

The National Federation of 
Women's Clubs will meet at the 
bureau of public welfare build- 
ing, San Rafael St, tomorrow 
May 17, All members of the 
board of directors, presidents cf 
provincial federations, and local 
ciub presidents, were request 
cd to attend* 



Manila was scheduled to gradually evolve into an orderly, clean and modern*? 
city, with her old landmarks respected and thfc customs and traditions of its people | 
preserved, according to Louis P. Croft of the City Planning Office. 

The Japanese destruction of the city disrupted those plans, while at the same 
time it speeded the execution of projects which would otherwise have been devel- 
oped very gradually. 

Calle Rosario and Reina 
Regente can now be easily 
widened and, together with Taft 
Avenue on the south and Ma- 
nugit on the north, the city will 
have a fine central adequate 
thoroughfare, The destruction 
of Jones Bridge affords an op- 
portunity to widen it, and 
lengthen its approaches. Build- 
ing desti'uction has also made 
it possible to cut Rizal Avenue 
through the river and eliminate 
Manila's worst traffic conges- 
tion, Croft said. 

It is now possible to straight- 
en Escolta and introduce pa- 
rallel and rectilinear streets 
and fill in the Estero-Reina 
land for building sites and park- 
ing spaces. Control on archi- 
tecture will not only avoid con- 
gestion and provide light and 
air but also develop a safe and 
functional architecture suited 
and distinctive of Manila, the 
planning chief pointed out- 
Manila may now have a real- 
ly good civic center. Public, 
buildings designed against 
earthquakes, heat and the per- 
iodical typhoons can be placed 
in a lar^e park-like area where 
the Walled City used to be. 
Residential areas in burned sec- 
tions can also be designed so as 
to be free from major traffic. 
In the Ermita and Malate dis- 
tricts, apartments can be built 
with only Taft Avenue and 
Dewey Boulevard carrying the 
heavy traffic loads. The area 
between these two major ar- 
teries can be designed to create 
a community life. In the cen- 
ter can be placed parks and 
playgrounds, schools, churches, 
shopping centers and other 
facilities. By proper interior 
street planning, traffic which 
does not serve the area can be 
discouraged from entering. This 
kind of community planning 



Order 
Nueva 



Halts 
Ecija 




Rice Traffic 

The flow of rice, palay and 
other food commodities from 
Nueva Ecija has been ordered 
stopped in a memorandum 
issued by Gov, Ju?n Chioco to 
all mayors of the piovinci 
recently, greatly reducing tht 
volume of cereal being smuggled 
out of the province* 

The order is being enforced 
with the cooperation of Emei- 
gency Control Administration 
officials, who are trying to 
stamp out the black market in 
Manila, according to the De- 
partment of Information. The 
governor also wishes to forestall 
a food shortage during the rainy 
season, and to bring down pricea 
of foodstuffs. 

Gov, Chioco is also intensify- 
ing his drive to stop official 
corruption in his province, tht 
Department of Information re- 
vealed. 

The governor has recently su&* 
pended the chief of police of 
Guimba, the second such chief 
of police "to be suspended, for 
alleged negligence. The case 
has been referred to the prov- 
incial fiscal.

can be applied to all residen- 
tial sections of the city now in 
ruins. 

Land can now be reserved 
for a comprehensive park sys- 
tem for Manila, Croft said 
playgrounds should be in the 
middle of communities outlined 
by heavy traffic routes* Play 
parks, such as Harrison Park, 
with ball fields and swimming 
pools; should, serve each dis- 
trict. Large outlying parks, 
such as the Balara Metropoli- 



tan Water Department area, 
shouTd provide for both passive 
and active recreation. A large 
greenbelt with parkway, foot 
trails, bicycle and bridle paths 
could extent in a semi-circular 
pattern around the outskirts of 
Manila. 

City planning is a tremendous 
park, concluded Croft, but he 
emphasized that everyone must 
pitch in, to create "a place 
where men Jive a common life 
for a noble end." 



Soldier, Filipino Killed In Blast 
Under Jones Bridge Span 



One U.S. serviceman and a 
Filipino laborer were killed 
and two others seriously in- 
jured when a box of dynamite 
exploded shortly before noon 
Friday, The accident took 
place aboard a barge under 
the Jones hridge. The explo- 
sion destroyed the west side 
of the Bailey span and para- 
lyzed traffic for six hours, 
- A check-up made by the 
Provost Marshal's office yes* 
terday revealed the explosion 
was accidental. A gang of 
U.S. servicemen and a few 
Filipino laborers were aboard 
a barge lying under the Jones 
bridge engaged in blasting 
sunken concrete in the water. 

A charge of dynamite had 
been exploded shortly before 
noon and the dynamite crew 
was preparing to go to lunch 



when a dynamite box on the 
middle deck of the barge sud- 
denly caught fire, followed 

seconds later by a terrific de- 
tonation. 
Two U.S. servicemen who 



suffered severe burns and 
physical injuries were rushed 
to the 60th Field Hospital 
where they were under obser- 
vation by Army physicians, 
police said.

Nazis Rebuild

Paris — A grim picture of 
retribution overtaking Ger-

French town was reported 
Sunday by the Netv York 
Times which said, in part: 

"One hundred fifty German 
prisoners of war were brought 
this afternoon to the village of 
Bucherc in Aube department 
which was destroyed on Aug- 
ust 24, 1944 after 62 of its few 
hundred inhabitants had been 
massacred by the retreating 
enemy, 

"The prisoners were lined 
up in the presence of survi- 
vors while the prefect of the 
department recalled the cir- 
cumstances. 

"Then he said, in substance, 
'The Germans deliberately de- 
stroyed this village; Germans 
will rebuild it. Set to/"

Senator Brands 
Nazi Atrocities 
As Unbelievable 

Northampton, Mass. — "Mere 
words could not bring home the 
systematic forms of torture im- 
posed upon political and other 
prisoners in some of the prison 
camps of Germany," Sen, Le- 
vtrett Saltonstall of Massachu- 
setts declared yesterday at 
commencement exercises of 
Smith College, 

Saltonstall, a member of the 
recent American mission to the 
Jleich to investigate German 
prison camps* declared the 
dead bodies in the Nazi camps 
were "piled like cord wood." 

"Knowledge of the atrocities 
against innocent people should 
tend to brace us for the solu- 
tion of problems of lasting 
peace/ 3 Saltonstall said, add- 
ing: 

"As one individual, and as a 
United States senator, I shall 
do all in my power to the end 
that this can never happen 
again."

Chiang Commends Role Played 
By U.S. and Chinese Airmen 



Chungking — General 
Chiang Kai-shek, in an 
order of the day, yesterday 
commended American and 
Chinese air forces for their 
help in smashing the Jap 
drive in Hunan province* 

Paying special tribute to the 
work of Maj. Gen. Claire L, 
Chennault's U. S. 14th Air 
Force, the order said: 

"In western Hunan, Chinese 
and American air forces had 
fought almost constantly. In 
supporting Chinese ground 
forces, they repeatedly dealt 
heavy blows to the enemy and 
inflicted heavy casualties.*' 

The Chinese high command 
announced its troops in Hunan 
were nearing Paoching, the 
Japanese key stronghold, with 
one Chinese column 15 1/2 miles 
northwest and another pushing 
down the main highway 19

"The delivery of supplies

grams/ 1 he declared, "will' be 
adjusted immediately to account 
for the end of organized resist- 
ance in Europe. 

"In view of the changed mil- 
itary situation; it is proposed 
that lend-lease shipments to the 
Soviet Union be reviewed and 
continued where they are justi- 
fied on the basis of adequate 
information regarding the essen- 
tial nature of Soviet military 
supply requirements and in the 
light of competing demands," 
He added: 

"It is anticipated that on this 
basis, substantial reductions in 
the current programs for the 
Soviet Union will be made*" 

Grew also revealed that 
"agreements have been conclud- 
ed with France, Belgium and 
the Netherlands which provide 
that at such time as the Pres- 
ident determines, straight lend- 
lease will cease and deliveiies 
thereafter will be made on 
agreed payment terms.!'

Nazi Home Guard Troops Freed 
Jo Start Spring Crop Planting 



With U. S. Third Army, Regensburg, Germany— 
The German home army and Wehrmacht troops are 
rioidly being discharged from Allied prison camps and 
iiven passes to permit them to get to German farms to 
Lin the planting of crops, according to Larry New- 
man I.N.S. correspondent. 

Newman in part said : "In their hands and in the 
hinds of German civilians lies the fate of Germany next 
winter for the Allied military government is not going to 
feed the Ger man population . ^ . g ^ ^ fa

Samar Booms 
Under Yanks 

The province of Samar which 
v . t s liberated by the American 
forces immediately after the 
occupation of Leyte is fast im- 
proving, especially the south- 
ern towns* of Guiuan and Sal- 
^edo, according to Felix De- 
cmito, USAFFE lieutenant, who 
came to Manila last Saturday 
-f or a conference with Sec. 
Tomas Conf esor. 

The U. S. Navy has converted 
the town of Guiuan into a vir- 
tual metropolis. Its narrow 
streets have been widened and 
paved and three modern docks 
have been constructed by the 
Navy for its own use. The 
water supply has been improved 
and modern buildings have been 
constructed. 

Foodstuffs are cheap, com- 
pared to those of Manila and 
good-paying jobs are plentiful. 



Church Group Drops 
Status in 'Union 0 

The Iglesia Evangelica Unida 
de Cristo unanimously decided in 
annual assembly last week to 
severe from the Union of Evan- 
gelical Churches organized dur- 
ing the Japanese occupation. 

This independent church re- 
turned to its pre-war status, 
Rev. Francisco G. Jaune, su- 
perintendent general, announced 
yesterday. 

In their assembly, a resolution 
has been adopted extending 
gratitude to the liberation forces 
°f the United States. 



which faces a long period of belt 
tightening. 

"The Third Army's assistant 
military government officer, Lt. 
Col. George L. Erion, declared 
the German people also must 
help feed those former slave 
workers who, for five long 
years, have produced food for 
the German forces and for the 
German people. 

" 'Germany has lived on the 
labor of European peoples 
through the war/- Col. Erion 
stated. 'Now it is the Germans' 
turn to tighten their belts and 
to repay the food stores they 
have stolen from their neigh- 
bors.' 

"The Third Army's area in- 
cludes much agricultural land, 
and the food situation in the 
region is not considered serious. 
But the Nazis prolonged the war 
throughout the two most im- 
portant planting months. 

"A serious food shortage^ is 
in the making for the coming 
winter unless the discharged 
home army work feverishly, 
now, and a good wheat, corn 
and potato crop is produced,"* 
added Newman. 



Army Provides 
Relief Work 

The U. S. Army PCAU has 
provided relief work to 16 out 
of 27 municipalities of the pro-

large Army hospital is operat- 
ing in San Jose, Nueva Ecija. 
The provincial hospital at Ca- 
banatuan is being supplied by 
PCAU #3 but the supervision

oor onape 

Of the textile mills operating 
before the war, only the equip- 
ment of the mills of the Na- 
tional Development Company is 
still intact, according to the 
general manager, Gregorio 
Anonas. 

The Philippine Cotton Mills 
belonging to Madrigal & Com-

While equipment of the mills 
of the National Development

Chance Tip Leads to Discovery 



Of c 



ommissioner s 



Lib 



rary 



Through a chance meeting between an enlisted man 
at GHQ and a USAFFE officer in the Claims Service, 
the valuable library of the last U. S. high commissioner 
to the Philippines, Francis B. Sayre, was discovered May 
1 in a house at 400 Dewey Boulevard. ; 

The books had been dumped* there when the Jap- 
anese Navy requisitioned the building from the Jap- 
anese embassy, early in 1943. The story was revealed 
this week by the Philippne Research and Information 
section, USAFFE. 



As soon as the library is 
sorted and catalogued, the law 
books will be kept in the Claims 
Service office and non-legal 
vol iimns will be placed in the 
office of the Philippine Re- 
search and Information section, 
USAFFE. The library will be 
used for reference purposes. 

The discovery of the library 
followed a seemingly provi- 



Elimination Bouts 
Slated for Boxers 

The Little Paras-Gon Lad- 
razo 10-round match scheduled 
for Saturday at the Al'egria 
theater on Rizal Avenue is a 
preliminary step toward clear- 
ing up the muddled situation as 
regards questionable titleholders, 
it was announced yesterday by 
Promoter A. P. Lauclico, of the 
Victory Boxing Enterprise. 

He added fighters who acquir- 
ed their titles during the Jap 
occupation must defend their 
titles against legitimate conten- 
ders as soon as possible, or 
stand the risk of being stripped 
of their crowns. 



FRATERNITY ORGANIZED 

About 300 Filipino students 
taking a refresher course at the 
University of Santo Tomas 
under the auspices of the Unit- 
ed States Army Services of 
Supply yesterday organized a 
USASOS civilian fraternity 
with the following officers: Jose 
L Plana, president; Francisco 
Rodil, vice-president; Felizardo 
Agustin, treasurer; Francisco 
Clemente; reporter; and Adolfo 
Laudit. Ssrt.-at-arms. T/Sgt. J. 
R. DeShazo is the faculty 
adviser. 



dential meeting between an of- 
ficer of the Claims Service and 
an enlisted man who had learn- 
ed that "there were some law 
books" in the Dewey Boulevard 
house. 

Two officers of the Claims 
Service then visited the house 
and were shown a stack of books 
in an upstairs room. Many of 
the volumes, carried the stamp 
of the High Commissioner's of- 
fice. 

.The discovery came as a com- 
plete surprise, inasmuch as the 
library was presumed lost in 
the destruction of the High 
Commissioner's building during 
the battle of Manila. 

The volumes were remold to 
the Trade and Commerce l *ld- 
ing on May 2nd and 3rd for , * 
by the Claims Service after oi* 
taining approval by the U. S. 
Consulate for the removal of the 
library. Some of the Japanese 
books found with the library 
bear the stamp of the Imperial 
Embassy, and others of the 
Ministry of Justice. 

The house on Dewey Boule- 
vard was occupied by Alfonso 
Zobel during the first two years 
of the Jap occupation. Zobel 
left the house when it was re- 
quisitioned by the Japanese and 
later men of the Japanese Em- 
bassy staff brought several 
truck loads of books and threw 
them in the basement. 

Zobel's caretaker, Arsenio 
Silayan, found the books, real- 
ized they were U. S. government 
property and after two week's 
labor managed to haul' them to 
the second floor, where it was 
dry and less likely to be visited 
by the Japanese. 

The Japs made no inquiry 
about the library after it had 
been dumped into the basement 
of the Zobel house,

was expressed here Tuesday 
night in a nationwide broadcast 
by Jan Masaryk, Czechoslova-

a tough role regarding Ger-

big:" ones must trust Little ones. 
I will trust the affairs of my 
country in this conference to 
the hip; nations. They have the 
power , so they naturally have 
the most responsibility. But I 
will squawk if I feci it is 
necessary for the welfare of my

Upholds Free Press 

Secretary of Interior Tomas Confesor, in a 
statement issued to newspaper publishers in Manila 
today upheld freedom of the local press to criticize 
the commonwealth government and government 
officials. 

"I believe," Confesor wrote, '-'that there should 
be no restrictions imposed" on censorship of news 
items criticizing government officials and govern- 
ment offices, or giving out information on differ- 
ences of opinion on disagreements among govern- 
ment officials." 

The secretary of interior emphasized only eucK 
criticism affecting military security should be sub- 
ject to censorship.

FOR WHICH WE FIGHT 

Nearly a year before the United States entered this war, 
President Roosevelt declared: "In the future days, which we seek 
to make secure, we look forward for a world founded upon four 
essential freedoms. The first is freedom of speech and 
expression — everywhere in the world." 

President Roosevelt knew, as many others since then have 
learned, that if there had been freedom of the press in Germany, 
Italy and Japan, the people in those countries would not have 
been so easily led into a war that v/ould result in their 
own destruction. 

It is gratifying that the ranking member of President 
Osmena's cabinet, Secretary of the Interior Tomas Confesor, has 
reaffirmed freedom of the press. It is easy for one to champion 
that freedom when it would work to his favor. Mr. Confesor 
champions it in a case where it would give his opposition more 
liberty to criticize his official conduct. In supporting the right 
of the local press to work without censorship on matters criticizing 
the Commonwealth Government and its officials that do not 
affect military security, Mr. Confesor reassures the Filipino 
people and their American well-wishers that even in wartime 
the fundamental liberties of a democratic people are unimpaired 
in the Philippines. 



Nazi Terror 



Report Stuns 
US. Congress 

Washington — The war 
crimes report read yesterday to 
both houses of Congress on evi- 
dence gathered by a congress- 
ional committee at three German 
concentration camps horrified 
the legislators, said William S. 
White reporting to the Neiv 
York Times. 

White said in his report: 

"The evidence of murder and 
tortures gathered by us in re- 
porting to a bi-partisan con- 
gressional committee solemnly 
accused the German government 
of 'organized crime against civil- 
ians and humanity.' 99 

No such arraignment of a 
foreign regime so brutal in 
concept had ever been presented 
to Congress by its members. The 
report, thousands of words de- 
scribing conditions that were 
called "a calculated diabolic 
program of planned torture and 
murder," was read in silence 
by Majority Leader Alben W. 
Barkley of Kentucky and Rep. 
R. Ewing Thomason of Texas, 
senior member of that body's 
military affairs committee. 

There was no demonstration 
in either house. Members sat 
with faces sick with horror. 

The proceeding had a judicial 
tone. The committee cailed for 
"swift, certain and adequate 
punishment". It left this action 
to Allied countries preparing 
the case against the Germans.

ed him dead for the past few 
weeks. 

She and her 15-year-old 
daughter said they had not seen 
Himmler since last November

staff are Maj. Gen. William J. 
Donovan, Sidney S. Alderman, 
Assistant Atty.-Gen. Francis M. 
Shea, and Navy Lts. James B.

Jackson said that because of 
work already being done on 
war crimes, he was setting up 
only a small staff to advise on 
policy, to supervise trial pre- 
paration and to help present 
cases. 

He' said the selections were 
made to advance his determina- 
tion that trials of leading war 
criminals must be held without 
delay. 

Gen. Donovan, 68, is direc- 
tor of the Offices of Strategic 
Services. He won the Congres- 
sional Medal of Honor in the 
last war and served as assis- 
tant attorney-general in the 
Cooledge administration. 

Donovan also served as U. S. 
district attorney for the west- 
ern district of New York. He 
was named coordinator of in- 
formation before he became di- 
rector of the Office of Strategic 
Services. 

Alderman, 52, was a captain 
in the last war, is a trial lawyer 
of distinction, and is general 
solicitor for the Southern rail- 
way from which he has obtained 
leave of absence. 

Shea, 39, has been an assis- 
tant attorney-general since 1939 
in charge of the claims division. 
He previously served as a spe- 
cialist in the legal division of 
the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and has had exten- 
sive experience in complicated 
litigation. 

Lt. Donovan, not related to 
Gen. Donovan, is general coun- 
sel of the Office of Strategic 
Services, and formerly was as- 
sociate general counsel to the 
Office of Scientific Research 
and Development. 
• Dean was a special assistant 
when Jackson was U. S. at- 
torney-general. 



Chinese Deny Any 
Jap Peace Feelers 

Chungking — Shih Chieh 
Wang, Chinese information min- 
ister, denied yesterday that he 
had received a peace feeler 
from "any responsible Japanese 
quarter." 

Wang said that "it is our firm 
conviction that no Japanese gov- 
ernment can be expected to offer 
surrender until the Japanese are 
placed in a position where they 
can no longer fight in the home 
islands or on the Asiatic main- 
land. 



Kjenerous Gl's 
Aid Guerrillas 

The comradeship and genero- 
sity of the American soldier is 
a major factor in maintaining 
the morale of the Filipino guer- 
rillas on Negros, according to 
Maj. Ramon L. Nolan, civil af- 
fairs officer of the Philippine 
Army, who was in Manila this 
week. 

Nolan said that the Gl's share 
their rations, blankets and even 
clothes with the poorly equipped 
Filipinos, many of whom are 
still wearing tattered civilian 
clothes after three years of 
fighting the Japanese. He add- 
ed that the guerrillas accustom- 
ed to sharp forays, of a few 
days' duration, have been fight- 
ing steadily for a month in the 
Silay mountains of northern 
Negros where a considerable 
pocket of Japanese is still hold- 
ing out.

Japanese Street Signs Confuse Visitor 



Several city streets, still 
bearing the stamp of the Jap- 
anese-controlled Philippine 
Republic, are misleading visi- 
tors, especially Gl's who have 
a hard time finding their way 
around the city. 

One street named after 
President Quezon, and all 
those named after famous 



Americans and the states of 
the Union were renamed by 
the ^ puppet city government 
during the Japanese occupa- 
tion to destroy American in- 
fluence in the country. 

A survey of the city shows 
that since the liberation of 
Manila more than three 
months ago, the Common- 



wealth government has not 
officially given back to these 
streets their old names. 

One soldier reported looking 
for a certain address asked a 
Filipino where he could find 
Quezon Avenue and he was 
told that he was standing

^day disclosed. 

The Burmese army, which 
silently bore the stigma of 
"traitors" while , apparently 
under Japanese domination for 
three years, was credited by the 
British yesterday with assisting 
in the liberation of Rangoon and 
is now fighting beside the Brit- 
ish against the Japs. 

The cooperation of the Bur- 
mese army with the British 
began in 1942, when two youth- 
ful Burmese approached the 
British explaining that the Jap- 
anese invasion had caused a 
split among the Burmese. 

The Burmese youths declared 
they were emissaries of the left 
wing group which did not be- 
lieve Japanese promises. They 
convinced the British of their 
integrity and British officers 
penetrated into Burma to help 
the Burmese organize. 

It was then that they were 
inspired by the successes of 
Filipino guerrillas which spread 
and influenced other groups. 

The tribes got information for 
the British, organized ambushes, 
and did anything that might 
disrupt Jap plans.

Confesor Thinks PNB 
Notes May Be Redeemed 

Secretary of Interior Tomas Confesor believes there 
is a chance that notes issued by the Philippine National 
Bank that were in circulation at the outbreak of the war 
may be redeemed — if they can be identified. 

~~ The Commonwealth Govern- 
ment had declared Philippine 
National Bank notes "not legal 
tender," because the Japanese 
had stolen and issued some 
P40,000,000 of notes which had 
already been redeemed and were 
kept in the vaults of the Trea- 
surv and against which no re- 
serve existed, according to Con- 
fesor. 

Since it is presently im- 
possible to distinguish PNB 
notes issued by the Japanese 
from those in lawful circulation 
at the outbreak of the war, the 
President declared all PNB 
notes not legal tender, said Con- 
fesor.

US. General 




Military Rule to Prevail, 
Eisenhower Aide Discloses 

Paris— Lt. Gen. Lucius D. Clay, deputy for General 
Kiaenhower for military occupation of Germany, yes- 
terday at a press conference, said that "the Allied gov- 
ernment in Germany is going to be military, the Ger- 
mans know it," and the "U.S. is going to stay in Ger- 
many in all probability for a long time." 

Explaining that the Supremo 
Allied Headquarters is still 
operative in Europe, and that 
he was speaking; for the U. S, 
group council that will take over 
after it finishes, Clay said that 
American occupation would have 
three initial aims. These aims 
were: 

1 — To smash all that h left 
of Germany's potential to 
make war, 

2 — To smash all vestiges of 
Nazism. 

3 — To see that all war 
criminals arc caught and 
punished. 

Clay declared that some Nazis 
were in power under the Ger- 
man military government and 
explained that their purging 
would be a long and continuous 
progress and would go on "until 
completely finished/' 

Clay said that he hoped the 
trials of war criminals would 
be started as soon as possible. 
He added that the long range 
plans for the regeneration of 
the German people were being 
formulated. 

It Wu Drought out at 
the conference that it will be 
Allied policy to turn over to 
any Allied government any- 
one wanted by that govern- 
ment as a war criminal, "War 
criminals not sent to jail will 
he given top priority as labor- 
ers to rebuild devastated 
countries* 

Civilian machinery will be 
established only on a very low 
civilian service role to keep es- 
sential" functions going* The 
only industries being re-estab- 
lished in Germany are those es- 
sential for the relief problems 
and transport needed by the 
military, 

The food situation in Ger- 
many will be a 'Very tight 
squeeze" this winter, it was 
disclosed. The Allies will not 
bring food into Germany until 
actual starvation conditions 
exist. 

. The military government in 
Germany will be operated en- 
tirely through army channels, 
although a considerable number 
of civilians will be employed. 

Supreme Allied Headquarters 
will continue, it was reveal ed» 
until each national army is set- 
tled in the final zones.

der of a B-29 which hit Nagoya 
after the raid had been prog- 
ressing more than an hour and 
a quarter, reported seeing a glow 
of flames 100 miles off the coast 
of Japan. 

The first American fliers over 
Nagoya in the latest attack said 
that they could see fires start- 
ed in Monday's raid still burn- 
ing. 

The pilots said that Nagoya's 
searchlight batteries were more 
of a nuisance than anti-aircraft 
fire, and that the few enemy 
interceptor planes which arose 
were unwilling to fight. 

The interceptor attack was 
described as largely inaccurate.

THE FILIPINO GUERRILLAS 

London has proudly announced thai Japanese-trained 
Burmese soldiers, inspired by the successes of Filipino guerrillas, 
turned against the Japanese and assisted the British in the 
liberation of Rangoon, it may be remembered that Burma was 
the first country in Japan's so-called Greater East Asia Co- 
prosperity Sphere to be granted a Tofcyo-made independence, 

m There is no doubt but that th© success of the heroic Filipino 
resistance movement has encouraged other Asiatic peoples in 
refusing to submit to total Japanese domination without a 
struggle. 

The saga of a people's refusal to bow before a foreign 
aggressor has been written many times In this war, especially 
throughout Europe. But in the Pacific, it fell to the Filipino to 
show the world that the love for freedom and democracy was 
not an exclusive qualify of the Occident.

disclosed yesterday that less 
than one percent of 
acreage at the outbreak of *M

He raised the question of | 
whether to revive the industry 
or turn to some other product, 
in view of the present indefinite 
trade relations between the 
United States and the- Philip- 
pines. 

"It would be of no use, Jic 
said, "to revive the Negros sugar 
industry, a process which may 
take as long as five years, only 
to junk it in the end," 

The sugar industry of the 
Philippines is technically back- 
ward, Montelibano pointed out. 
Based on a complex and ineffi- 
cient social relation, it could not 
hope, as constituted, even in its 
best days, to compete en an 
equal basis with the Japanese 
sugar industry. 

The government derived more 
than half its revenues in the 
past from the sugar industry* 
yet made little if any effort to 
streamline and modernize it, 
said Montelibano- "Not a single 
fertilizer plant was established 7 
and only the minimum experi- 
mental work was undertaken to 
improve cane culture." 

Only science and absolute co- 
operation of all the elements In- 
volved in the Philippine sugar 
industry can revive it, he em- 
phasized,

EDITORIAL 

THE FILIPINO GUERRILLAS 

London has proudly announced that Japanese-trained 
Burmese soldiers, inspired by the successes of Filipino guerrillas, 
turned against the Japanese and assisted the British in the 
liberation of Rangoon. It may be remembered that Burma was 
the first country in Japan's so-called Greater East Asia Co- 
prosperity Sphere to be granted a Tokyo-made independence. 

There is no doubt but that the success of the heroic Filipino 
resistance movement has encouraged other Asiatic peoples in 
refusing to submit to total Japanese domination without a 
struggle. 

The saga of a people's refusal to bow before a foreign 
aggressor has been written many times in this war, especially 
throughout Europe* But in the Pacific, It fell to the Filipino to 
show the world that the love for freedom and democracy was 
not an exclusive quality of the Occident.

Sugar Leader 
Outlines Big 
Hurdles Ahead 

Declaring that the sugar in- 
du35 in Negros is "flat on its 
ti:» AifrU M^teljbar^ 
president of the Confederation 
of Sugar Planters' Associations 
disclosed yesterday that Jg 
than one percent of the total 
acreage at the outbreak of the 
wav is now in cultivation thuc. 

He raised the question of 
whether to revive the industry 
or turn to some other product, 
in view of the present indefinite 
trade relations between the 
United States and the^ Philip- 
pines* if t rt 

"It would be of no use, lie 
said, "to revive the Negros sugar 
industry, a process which may 
take as long as five years, only 
to junk it in the end." 

The sugar industry of the 
Philippines is technically back- 
ward, Montelibano pointed out. 
Based on a complex and ineffi- 
cient social relation, it could not 
hope, as constituted, even In its 
best days, to compete on an 
equal basis with the Japanese 
sugar industry, 

The government derived more 
than half its revenues in the 
past from the sugar industry, 
yet made little if any effort to 
streamline and modernize it, 
Said Montelibano. "Not a single 
fertilizer plant was established, 
and only the minimum experi- 
mental work was undertaken to 
improve cane culture." 

Only science and absolute co- 
operation of all the elements in- 
volved in the Philippine sugar 
industry can revive it, he em- 
phasized.

Student Travel 



It is the U. S. Army's desire 
to facilitate transportation for 
Filipino students who are duly 
authorized to go to the United 
States to continue their studies, 
whenever it does not interfere 
with the needs of the military 
and the war effort, according 
to Captain James A. Callender, 
Istant adjutant general, 
LSAFFE headquarters, in a 
letter answering a recent query 
made by Maximo M. Kalaw, 
secretary of the department of 
instruction and information. 

Captain Callender said : 
''Every consideration possible 
will be given to those students 
whose travel is authorized by 
the United States State Depart- 
ment and the Commonwealth of 
the Philippines. 

"Authorized requests for 
travel should be forwarded to 
this headquarters and decision 
will be made on the individual 
merits of each case. Cost of 
transportation must be borne by 
the individuals concerned." 



Bares Privation 
In Laguna District 

There is misery and suffer- 
ing in 12 municipalities of the 
second district of Laguna, ac- 
cording to Congressman Cri- 
santo M. Guysayko. 

Almost all houses and build- 
were razed to the ground 
retreating Japs who fled to 
*he Sierra Madre mountains 
and Mt. Banahaw as American 
forces approached Laguna. The 
Japs looted food stores and 
murdered more than 1,000 
•civilians, he said. 

Though peace has returned to 
-he towns of Santa Cruz, Pag- 
•^njan, Paete, Pangil, Luisiana, 
Famy, Cavinti, Pangil, Siniloan, 
Sta. Maria, Lumbang and 
Rizal — the burned municipal- 
ties — normalcy has not been 
stored. The people live in 
makeshift shelters and food is 
scarce. According to Congress- 
1 Guysayko, a ganta of rice 
^ Santa Cruz costs P4. 



The battle which crippled the 
Franklin took place March 19 
when the Franklin was operat- 
ing with a fast carrier task- 
force in an air strike against the 
remnants of the Japanese fleet 
in the Inland Sea within 60 
miles of Japan. Many of her 
planes were on deck loaded with 
bombs and rockets and machine- 
gun ammunition, when a Jap 
dive bombing .plane scored two 
hits with 500 pound armor 
piercing bombs. 

One bomb detonated beneath 
the flight deck on which the 
armed planes were placed. The 
second bomb went off on a 
hangar deck among planes 
which were fueled and ready to 
be taken to the flight deck. 

A Japanese plane was shot 
down within a minute by patrol- 
ling carrier fighters but explod- 
ing bombs had already started 
a train of explosions which last- 
ed for hours. Casualties on the 
ship included 341 dead, 431 miss- 
ing and more than 300 wounded. 

Many tons of bombs and am- 
munition exploded aboard the 
carrier and the resulting fires 
were fed by thousands of gallons 
of aviation gasoline. The whole 
after end of the carrier's flight 
deck became a mass of flames 
and smoke. The airplanes dis- 
integrated, as did their pilots 
and crewmen. 

Aviation gasoline poured over 
the sides of the hangar deck 
like a blazing Niagara. Bombs, 
rockets, bullets, splinters of 
wood and steel menaced survi- 
vors who hugged the decks for 
safety. There was no panic. 

Later, the light cruiser Santa 
Fe came alongside to remove 
the wounded. The two ships were 
so close together that the gun 
platforms on the Franklin's 
starboard were damaged. Scores 
of wounded were removed from 
the carrier by makeshift mail

British parliament will 
be asked to prolong until 
December 1948 the present gov-

this consolidation of our occupa- 
tion of Germany and the institu- 
tion of policies of Allied control 
and zonal administration of a 
stern government of Germany 
providing a program of benefit 
to Germany. The economic needs 
of the countries which have been 
despoiled bv Germany must be 
considered. The Germans must 
be put to work to produce their 
own food and German industry 
must be controlled and the war 
industry ended," 

Patterson added: "Then there 
is the tremendous task of caring 
for and returning: to their homes 
the millions of displaced persons 
used and abused by Germany 
as slave labor. Rehabilitation 
of our prisoners of war and re- 
turn of the wounded swiftly to 
the United States are immediate 
duties. 

"The shifting of men and 
equipment to the Pacific," 
Patterson disclosed, 4 is « 
course an objective of the 
first consequence. Finally, 
there is the matter of dispos- 
ing of equipment which can- 
not be removed practically 
and the liquidations of Allied 
Interest in buildings and land 
which were necessary far 
campaigns against Germany. 

Patterson commented that the 
German people were well fed 
and well clothed, The rural 
areas of the Reich, he said, were 
untouched by war, adding that 
there appeared to be ample op- 
portunity for Germans to prow 
their own food. Manpower, Pat- 
terson declared, would be a tre- 
mendous problem, since slave 
labor is no longer available. 
German demands for agricul- 
tural* labor will be balanced 
against Allied needs for German 
labor in allocating Nazi pris- 
oners of war for work. 

Patterson assorted that he 
thought it would be "an ideal 
job" for Germans to clear farms 
in France and other Allied 
countries of mines left by re- 
treating Nazi forces.

Queen Mary, With 50,000 Tro(f 
Aboard, Saved After Collision 



London — The transport 
Queen Mary, carrying 50,000 
American troops collided with 
the light British cruiser Curacao 
on October 2, 1942, the British 
Admiralty revealed in a belated 
report yesterday. 

The cruiser was sunk and the 
Queen Mary was badly damaged, 
but miraculously made port at 
14 knots through submarine in- 
fested waters and the dangers 
of German bombers. 



Tli ere were no casualties 
aboard the Queen Mary. 

The Queen Mary's bow, built 
to withstand just such a colli- 
sion, was curled back like a torn 
tin can open to the waves. 

In such a predicament she 
could not stop to pick up the 
Curacao survivors at the risk 
of her own human cargo.

hospital inside a German compound in Flensburg, according to a 
broadcast by Joseph C. Harsch, Columbia Broadcasting System

military leaders that they had no connection with Hitler's Nazi party 
demagogues. 

Harsch reported that ho saw Rosenberg and revealed that "the 
creature I saw cowering did not act as though he had much faith in 
the innocence he protested" whon British officers asked him if ho knew

THE PRESIDENT'S RETURN 

President Sergio Osmena does not return to the Philippines 
empty handed. 

In those few weeks he spent in the United States after 
Manila was liberated, the Commonwealth president has accom- 
plished much mat will have a direct bearing on the present and 
the future of the Filipino people. 

His meetings with President Truman, In behalf of his 
bleeding, broken, war-torn country, brought the warming pledge 
from the American chief executive that the "Philippine people 
will be fully assisted by the United States In the great problems 
of rehabilitation and reconstruction which lie ahead.". 

More concretely, President Osmeria carries with him an 
expression from President Truman that "suitable reciprocal trade 
with the United States should continue for such time after Inde- 
pendence as m<iy be necessary to provide the new republic with 
a fair opportunity to secure aconomic freedom and indepen- 
dence/ 1 

This expression from the President of the United States 
means much to the pockerbook and the stomach of the average 
Filipino. It moans that United States does not intend to set 
free the Filipinos only to let them drift helplessly through eco- 
nomic depression during those important formative years when 
the Philippines, already shattered by war, must recuperate and 
weld a strong republic. It means there will be markets for what 
the Philippines can produce* 

The people of the Philippines can greet their President with 
the words "well done/ 1

night, seven armed men with 
masks on their faces entered 
the home of Leopoldo Trinidad 
on 1083 Bilibid Vie jo and took 
money and jewelry amounting to

The noise attracted the atten- 
tion of an American soldier who 
was a visitor in the ground 
floor. When he went to investi-

robbers* 

Laurcano Franco, 18, residing

n V iation engineers battalion 
specially chosen ' for this task 
a fter 26 months of service build- 
ing air fields in the Alaska 
Aleutians. 

Power shovels filled one truck 
every 47 seconds. Coral haul- 
ing went on 24 hours a day and 
the men worked in 12-hour 
shifts. After 12 days actual 
work, the runways were com- 
pleted and the taxi ways were 
paved for parking planes. The 
318th Army fighter group is 
now operating Thunderbolts 
from the new field. 

American forces, who earlier 
captured and operated the Ka- 
dena and Vontan airfields, now 
have a third usable field for 
pressing the aerial offensive 
against Japan, The Seventh 
4miy Air Force announced that 
both bombers and fighters will 
use it. 

The captured Machinato and 
Yonabaru air strips, which the 
Japs continue to cover with

Jap Air Losses Now Reaching 
Point Suffered by Luftwaffe 

Washington— Increasing destruction of the Jap- 
anese airtorce is reaching a point suffered by the now 
dead German Luftwaffe in the closing days of the war 
m Europe, the U, S. Navy Department revealed 
Saturday. 

Navy and Marine airmen alone destroyed 1,782 
Japanese planes as against their own losses of 188 in 
the first quarters of 1945, bringing total Jap air losses 
credited to the Navy's twin air branches to 11,601 since 
the Pacific war began, <

BREAKS WITH JAPAN 

Copenhagen — Th e Danish 
government Saturday broke 
relations with Japan and an- 
nounced recognition of the 
Chinese government of Gen, 
Chiang Kai-shek, 



for the Pacific war were 2,070 
on April 1 of this year. 

The victory ratio in favor of 
the Navy and Marines over the 
Japs for the entire Pacific war, 
dating from Pearl Harbor, is 
6.6-tti-l. 

However, since January 1, 
1945, the Navy's two air arms 
have attained a ratio of nearly 
10-1 over the enemy. Navy f ig- 
ures are 9.4-to-l, actually doub- 
ling the victory ratio for 1944. 

The Navy said figures for the 
first quarter of 1945 are preli- 
minary* and probably will be 
revised upward as cpmplete 
reports from outlying units be- 
come available. 



Vie© Admiral Aubrey W. 
Fitch, deputy chief of naval 
operations for the air forces, 
gave figures up to Friday as: 

"Of 1,782 Japanese planes des- 
troyed in the first three months 
of this year, nearly 800 were 
shot out of the air by our avia- 
tors. -It is doubtful if the 
enemy's aircraft production and 
pilot training can keep up with 
such a mortality rate. 

"The remainder of the Jap- 
anese losses, more than 1,000, 
were inflicted on grounded air- 
craft as our planes, mostly from 
fast carrier task forces, pinned 
down the Japanese air power in 
supporting amphibious opera- 
tions and heavy bombing raids, 
both by army and navy." 



Nazi Prisoners Help Speed 
U.S. Shift to War in Pacific 

Paris — Thousands of German soldiers are now 
engaged in work which is helping along the war 
against their former ally—Japan, a press dispatch 
disclosed Saturday. As soon as they are processed, 
the Nazi prisoners are put to work repairing Ameri- 
can trucks to carry supplies to the Pacific Wai\ 

Skilled German labor is found among those

travel to embarkation ports. 

The pay scale for this work is low and not 
paid in cash. Moreover, all will eventually have to 
be paid by Germany, the dispatch said.

First Signs Are Noted 
Of Jap Crackup in 
Okinawa Fighting 

Guam— First signs of a crack-up of organized Jap- 
anese resistance became evident although the enemy was 
expending man power in a desperate attempt to hold 
the hilly five-mile line across Okinawa, according to 
yesterday's Pacific Fleet communique, 

Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz said that the U.S. 
10th Army troops were "maintaining heav 4 y pressure" 
against the enemy all along the southern Okinawa front 
with the Japs throwing reserves into hand-to-hand 
combat 



The Japanese death toll on 
bloody Okinawa mounted to 48,- 
103, Nimitz announced. Ameri- 
can casualties for the Ryukyua 
and associated operations to- 
talled 8,310 killed and missing 
and 22,210 wounded. The figures 
include Army and Marine 
casualties between March 18 
and May 18 and fleet casualties 
between March 18 and May 16. 

Nimitz said that 139,858 Oki- 
nawa civilians had been placed 
under jurisdiction of the U. S. 
Military government authorities. 
The Japanese, Nimitz's com- 
munique disclosed, have sacri- 
ficed law numbers of troops at 
Sugar Loaf Hill, key position 
overlooking Naha, capital city. 
The Sixth Division Marines 
were pushed off the hill for the 
fourth time Thursday night and 
rcoccupied it again Friday mom. 
mg. During the American 
advance two battalions of Jap 
troops were destroyed. 



The enemy's lines on Okinawa 
which are being defended with 
the greatest tenacity of the en- 
tire operation, were penetrated 
by the 10th Army on Wednes- 
day and Thursday. A company 
of the 96th Division engaged in 
a one-hour grenade battle with 
a force of counter-attacking Jap- 
anese, depriving the enemy of 
the important high point, Coni- 
cal Hill. 

On the same days in the 77th 
Division zone of action, the 
307th regiment captured a small 
hill. Twice forced to retire, the 
hill was twice recaptured, but 
the Americans were again 
forced to retire later in the day 
due to heavy artillery and 
mortar fire. 

Ground troops were supported 
on Thursday and Friday by 
heavy naval gunfire and by air- 
craft from escort carriers and 
from Marine aircraft Wing and 
the 319th army fighter group,

where the first Philippine As- 
sembly held its sessions in 1907, 
was blasted by explosives stored 
there by the Japanese during 
their occupation of the city.

of the first members of the As- 
sembly has been saved, Teodoro

Marines 9 Charge Spoils Jap Fete 



Okinawa— May 17 (delayed) 
—Nearly 200 Japanese, obvious- 
ly celebrating local victories, 
were surprised by First Marine 
Division troops and killed in a 
brief, bloody struggle, accord- 
ing to W> H. Lawrence of the 
Ni Y. Times. 

It was a sweet victory for the 
Marine comnanv. Its members 
had seen two platoons of their 
comrades virtually wiped out by 
the same celebrating Japanese 



who retired before IL S. tanks, 
artillery, mortars and bayonets. 
Marines who participated in 
the battle said they saw Jap- 
anese officers strutting about 
camps in full dress uniform as 
our troops crept toward the 
ridge, The ridge had been 
dubbed n Carbuncle Hill" be- 
cause of its shape, also because 
of tho damage inflicted on U. S. 
troops by the enemy In previous 
assaults. 



Most of the Japanese were 
plainly silhouetted on the hill- 
side but others were in caves. 
The U. S, captain sighted the 
Japanese command post through 
his binoculars in the middle of 
the celebration. He swiftly sent 
two platoons of his tanks down 
the draw straddling the narrow 
gauge railway leading toward 
Naha. 

The Japs failed to hear the 
tanks coming until they opened 
fire on the southern ledges -and 



caves of the hill. For ^wo hours 
the tanks kept blasting away 
and the surprised Japs had their 
guns knocked out before they 
could use them, 

. While the tanks were still 
firing and mortar fire rained 
down on enemy positions, the 
Marines charged. They found 
bodies of the Japs were strewn 
all over the area. Cave mouths 
were found chipped and blood- 
stained and these were promptly 
sealed by demolition.

Allies Maffitlse Famed Skoda 
Works for War Against Japs 

PILSEN, CZECHOSLOVAKIA — The possibility of 
restoring the famous Skoda munitions works for use in the 
war against Japan was being studied by an Allied repara- 
tions commission, press dispatches revealed yesterday. 

The Skoda works provided the German war machine 
with some of its finest weapons, including giant Tiger tanks 
and heavy cannon, following its seizure by the Nazis in 1938.

Fanatical Resistance of Nazis 
Works Hardships on All Germans 



£^D !_/ 1 OR I A L 

" THE SAME BREED 

The pictures of German atrocities which appeared m this 
newsnaper last Saturday must have reawakened famd.ar, painful 
memories of what happened in the streets of Manila not so 
many weeks ago. 

They are the same scenes one found when Manila was 
liberated. The emaciated forms lying prone In the prison yards 
at Nordhausen were grisly replicas of what American troops 
uncovered w the nipa shacks at Santo Tomas, 

The charred bodies at Erla had their counterpart In the 
sealod dungeons of Fort Santiago. 

This then, is the character of the enemy, graphically 
dofined. Whether termed Nazi or its Japanese equivalent, 
they shored the same Fascist philosophy — exploit, then destroy, 
in q wave of destruction that eventually swallows perpetrator* 
as well as victims. 

The scenes in Manila, in Erla, in Nordhausen illustrate what 
Germany meant by her "United Europe;" what Japan means by 
her "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere/ 1 

Today, the rotten husk of the Nail has been ripped open, 
bared to the world, its spreading poison sapped. But before 
fie structure fell, Its fanatics needlessly dragged German men, 
women, and children through chaos, through terror, through 
the most thorough beating In Germany's history, long after 
resistance was useless. 

Now, as ground forces under General MacArthur sw©!l 
from the Influx of men freed from the Battle of Europe, as 
American sea and air forces converge for the one remaining 
enemy, it Is obvious that defeat for Japan's particular brand of 
Fascism awaits only time, 

The people of Japan can undergo the same chaotic, terror- 
fSled defeat suffered by Germany if they permit fane^lc 
warlords to drag the homeland through useless carnage, simpfy to 
perpetuate their own power. 

Or they can kick out their crazed leaders and salvage aj 
portion of their heritage for a future rebirth among a family 
of free nations. 

it Is for Japan to decide which route she*, shall take to thft 
same inevitable end — unconditional surrender*

VaWes Counsels 
Military Police 

"Try to make the Military 
Police Command a strong and 
respected organization/' Maj. 
Gen, Basilio Valdes, chief of 
staff of the Philippine Army, 
urged in a speech before the 
Military Police Command School 
in Alabang last Sunday. 

Gen. Valdes told the first 
graduates of the school to "bear 
in mind that any misbehavior 
will be a discredit not only to 
you as an individual but to your 
organization as well," 

He counselled: "Remember 
that in military life, silence is 
golden. Do not get into the 
habit of discussing with out- 
siders matters affecting your 
work. The most deadly instru- 
ment of destruction is the 
human tongue/'

For Hospital 

Public Hospital PCAU 4, lo- 
cated at the corner of Tecson 
and T. Earnshaw streets, will 
be closed on May 27,. according 
to Dr. Vicente M, Cenissa, di- 
rector of the hospital. 

The hospital has been advised 
by Maj. Paul Parrino, of the 
U. S« Army Medical Corps, not 
to admit any more new "patients 
and to see to it that the affairs 
of the hospital are wound up 
by May 26, 

The hospital, which has been 
serving indigent residents of 
Tondo, Binondo, San Nicolas, 
Maypajq, and Navotas and Ma- 
labon, Rizal, has treated no less 
than 20,000 cases since it was 
established on February 4, 

The hospital started as a 
charity clinic on donations by 
civic-minded residents of Tondo 
and was later taken over by the 
PCAU 4 when it was found that 
it could satisfy hospital needs 
of people within the immediate 
vicinity.

AsksTemporary 
Use of Sugar 
Land for Food 

Xhe plan to rehabilitate the 
Industry is divided into 
mediate and the long- 
according to Alfredo 
jtelibano, chairman of the 
ne Sugar Rehabilitation 
;tee. The immediate plan 
^vers the planting of cane for 
idlings for such rehabilitation 
am as may be developed, 
ing the rehabilitation of 
dustry, draught animals, 
raized equipment and farm 
y.ionts must be secured in 
order to turn the sugar lands to 
production of foodstuff to 
the present shortage, 
!:bano said. He pointed 
that no matter how good a 
itation plan may finally 
rked out, it must fail if 
it inflation induced by 
shortage should continue. 
The permanent rehabilitation 
ram for the sugar industry 
must aim at the ability to com- 
pete with other countries on an 
equal basis in U. S. and world 
sugar markets, without favor or 
ege, Montelibano declared, 
economic assistance as is 
nought by the industrv 
from the United States should 
?d only to readjust the 
Philippine sugar industry to 
nd open competition with 
*e sugar industry of other 
countries, he said. 



^ against it. 

There is no way for the Jap- 
anese to deploy in depth as 
did the Germans, Richardson 
observed, adding, that the enemy 
must try to stand up against 
the entire mass of the striking 
forces of the United States. 



/'Our opportunity to destroy 

his war-making power is greater 
and each attack will be propor- 
tionately more destructive," 
declared Richardson. 

"If the Japanese c&mmand 
makes a logical estimate of to- 
day's situation it must conclude 
that the Empire is doomed to 
utter defeat. 

"The U. S. obviously possesses 
the material power with which 
to win the war. Backing this, 
and in its essence three times 
more effective, is the inflexible 
will and determination of the' 
United Nations to see the war 
through to a sweeping victory.'' 

Continuing, Richardson said: 
"The Japanese people have ob- 
viously been kept dark as to the 
true situation taking shape 
against them. They have been 
propagandized and indoctrinated 
into acceptance of unquestioning 
belief in the invincibility of 
their armed forces. 

"But even the Japanese high 
command cannot keep from the 
people the effect of B-29 raids 
on Tokyo and Nagoya, which in 
f-hemselves are mere shadows of 
things to come. WL— 

"The indoctrinated Japanese 
citizen must be somewhat de^ 
pressed by the sight and sound 
of his home city in process of 
being blasted flat," Richardson 
commented. 



Manila's Fire

From March 1 to April 30, 
the Fire Department res- 
ponded to 71 fire calls, worked 
780 man hours, and pumped

WASHINGTON— The U. S. 
Hodges — the same army which 



First Army commanded by Gen. Courtney B 
spearheaded the crossing of the Rhine and wai 
first to make junction with the Russians— is on the move from Europe to tb- 
Pacific, the War Department revealed yesterday. 

An official statement said : ■ * 

"It is being redeployed by way of the United States and its - personnel wtf # 
receive furloughs before proceeding to war against Japan." . . 

Division and army groups'^ 
that fight with the First Army 
against Japan will not neces- 
sarily be the same as those that 
battled in Germany, However, 
enough veteran units and vete- 
ran personnel will take the field 
under Gen, Hodges to insure 
"the same vigorous assault 
against the Japanese as was 
made by the First Army against 
Germany." 

The fighting record of the 
First Army ranks with the 
proudest in the Allied expedi- 
tionary forces. Although the 
army itself did not enter combat 
until the invasion of Normandy, 
several units took part in the 
original landings in North 
Africa, Sicily and Italy. 

Troops of the First Army 
parachuted into France before 
D-Day, led the way across the 
German frontier, broke through 
the Siegfried Line, seized and 
established the Remagen bridge- 
head, and were first to make 
junction with the Russians at 
Elbe. Hundreds of thousands 
of Germans were killed or cap- 
tured by the First Army in its 
battles across France, Belgium, 
and Germany.

ITOSUL 



AMMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION 

The news is good from China these days* Within the past 
tf© weeks. Gen, Cbbng Kai-shek's troops have generated two 
urprise counter-aiiacks in Hunan and Honan provinces, 
aved an important /American a,rbase_ and penetrated to the 
^hjna coast at two po*ms tor the first time in a year. 

Directly related an- the revival of Chinese offensive power 
, n d the increased pac* or .sir arracks mounted from Philippines 
lases against Formosa and Ihg China coast. 

Since General MacArtWi forces first established them- 
aives on Luzon and the oi/ter Visayas, a great burden has been 
ifted from the undermanned U.S, 14th Air Force operating in 
;hfna. Until that time, , Gen. Chennault was forced to dissi- 
>ate his skeleton force in scaHered operations over the length 
Uid breadth of China and the seas beyond. 

Now, the powerful air fleers under General MacArthur have 
»akcn over the brunt of attacks on the fringe of the Asiatic 
nalnland. Daily, air armadas launched from the Philippines 
roam the South China Sea- In the short space of months 
tfiey have virtually chnuded this former ''Japanese pond' 1 of 
memy shipping. Other planes of the MacArthur command 
have levelled great sections of Formosa and played havoc with 
overstrained Japanese communications along the entire South 
China Sea coasts. 

But more important, they have freed Gen. Chennault's 
oombers and fighters for the critical task of the moment — hard- 
Sitting tactical support of Chinese ground forces. 

This helping hand extended from the Philippines has played 
irj inestimable part in helping roll back the Japanese on the 
Asiatic mainland.

An extensive food production drive has been launch-^" 
ed by the provincial government of Pangasinan, one- 
time granary of the Philippines, Governor Sofronio 
Quimson reported yesterday. 

Governor Quimson said that the new budget of the 
province includes an item for agricultural inspector in 
each of the 46 municipalities -through whom the govern- 
ment will undertake its greater food production 

^campaign. 

The government will urge the 
Pangasinan farmers to supple- 
ment rice planting with second- 
ary crops like corn, camote and 
other root crops, it was revealed. 

The provincial governor said 
that food production campaign 
will also include the improve- 
ment of animal and poultry 
raising to cope with present 
demands. 

He disclosed that the govern- 
ment has re-established the four 
pre-war breeding stations in the 
municipalities of Santa Barbara, 
Dasol, Sual and Mangatarem. 

According to present plans, 
the government will educate the 
farm folks in the breeding of 
better stocks of chickens like 
the white leghorns. The public 
will eventually be supplied with 
white leghorn chicks and eggs 
from the breeding stations or 
from localities producing them.

breed of carabaos used in Pan- 
gasinan farms is also contem- 
plated.

delegations of the United 
States, the United King-

a formula designed to inte-

City to Restore True Names 
To Puppet-Labelled Streets 

City streets named after prominent Americans and 
the states of the Union as well as the avenue named 
after President Quezon will shortly get back their old 
names, it was learned at Malacanan yesterday.

engineer, Secretary Tomas Con- 
fesor of the department of inte- 
rior ordered the removal of the 
counterfeit street names placed 
by the puppet Philippine Re- 
public and the posting of the 
true names. 

These streets were renamed 
by the puppet government dur- 
ing the Japanese occupation to 
carry out the Japanese policy 
of destroying American in- 
fluence in Greater East Asia, 
especially in the Philippines. 

While the change has not af- 
fected the memory of fcity res- 
idents who have always called 
the streets by their old names, 
nvw visitors of the city were 
often confused and could not 
locate the streets.

near future. We are no

ippines to procure strategic mate- 
rials and examine the possibilities 
of commercial trade there, Ben 
Reese, vice president of the Foreign 
Economic Administration's U. S.

yesterday. 

The agency will not compete with 
private enterprise. A recent mis- 
sion to the Philippines discovered 
that skilled Philippine labor de- 
sires manufactured products rather 
than currency in payment and as 
a result goods will be entered for 
strategic materials.

indomitable will to win which 
was unsurpassed."

TRANSLATED INTO ACTION 

President Truman's pledge that America will fully assist 
the Philippines "in the great problems of rehabilitation and 
reconstruction" has already been translated into concrete action. 

This week, Filipinos heard the warming announcement from 
Secretary of Rnante Jaime Hernandez In Washington that a 
monthly allotment of vessels had been assured by the War 
Shipping Administration to carry relief and consumer goods to 
\h& Philippines, And Genera! MacArfhur has granted theater 
clearance for such cargo to be discharged at Philippine ports. 

Nothing could be more welcome than the arrival of cloth, 
pots, pans, soap, of many items which the Japanese stripped 
from the Filipinos during three years of occupation. The arrival 
of these ships should put a dent in the present high cost of living 
In the Philippines and pull out a few of the props from under 
4ie black market. 

But more than that, the dispatch of consumer goods, many 
of which the American public has been forced to do without 
during wartime, helps re-emphasize that American friendship for 
the Philippines, American pledges, are not confined to words.

Japan's Luzon mountain strong- 
hold. Gairdner also praised the 
morale and fighting ability of 
the battle-seasoned Red Arrow 
nfantrymen— many of them now 
in their fourth year overseas. 

Following the tortuous trail 
over hog-backed ridges into 
cloud-shrouded peaks in his first 
visit to the Luzon front, Gaird- 
ner, formerly chief of staff to 
Gen. Alexander in Africa, quick- 
ly noticed the similarity between 
the Caraballo front and the 
mountain fighting in Burma. 

Gairdncr's strong praise for 
the 32nd" Division doughfoots 
was matched by Gen, Swift's en- 
thusiasm and admiration for the 
job Gen, Gill and his redoubt- 
able fighters are doing, 

"This is an impossible situa- 
tion/ 1 General Swift observed, 
"and the 32nd is doing the im- 
possible. The engineering and 
supply problem was impossible, 
but they've solved it. The pro- 
blem of evacuating the wounded 
down the trail at night in black- 
outs was impossible, but they 
solved it." 

For what is believed the first 
time in the war against Japan, 
Swift said that intense concen- 
trations of artillery and mortar 
fire are driving the Japs from 
1 1 1 e i r d ee p 1 y -flu g moun t ai n caves. 

In one day,. 112 Japs— driven 
from their holes — were mowed 
down by rifle and maehinegun 
fire, Swift disclosed, adding 
that it had never before hap- 
pened in the Pacific. In the 
past, only flame-throwers, dyna~. 
mite and grenades have been 
effective. The Japs have usual- 
ly died in their holes.

CHURCHILL RESIGNS POST 



Will Pave Way for 
General Elections 

London— Winston Churchill yesterday resigned as 
prime Minister, first lord of the treasury and minister 
of defense, tendering his resignation to the King at 
Buckingham Palace. 

Churchill's not unexpected resignation followed 
refusal of the Labor Party to continue indefinitely the 
coalition cabinet formed for a united war prosecution 
in 1940. His resignation was regarded largely as a 
formality to clear the way for Britain's general election 
on July 3, and also for appointment of a "caretaker 
government" to serve in the interim under Churchill. 

Churchill was expected to complete his interim 
all-conservative government before the House of Com- 
mons reassembled next Wednesday. 

Parliament will be dissolved officially June 15. 
The general election in July f 
will mark Britain's first in the 
last ten years. It will give Bri- 
tons their first chance to vote 
since November 14, 1935, and 
wffl also end the longest lived

Biddle, Perkins, Wickard Quit Cabinet 



WASHINGTON — In the 
first cabinet reshuffle since 
taking over office at Presi- 
dent BoosevcltV death, Mr, 
Truman Wednesday an- 
nounced the following 
changes; 

Atty. Gen, Francis Biddle

Clark of Texas; *~ 



Secretary of Labor Fran-

Secretary of Agriculture 
Claude Wickard resigned, to

P. Anderson of New Mexico; 

War Food Administrator 
Marvin Jones resigned, to be 



replaced by the new secret- 
ary of agriculture. 

Wickard will be appointed 
rural electrification adminis- 
trator. The President told a 
press conference that he had 
not requested any resigna- 
tions, but resignations of all 
cabinet members had been 
submitted to him to do with

parliament in modem history 
The Labor Party, second most 
numerous party in Britain, chal- 
lenged Churchill's domestic 
leadership, in a conference at 
Blackpool recently. The Labor- 
ites adopted a sweeping reform 
program calling for an ultimate 
establishment of a British 
Socialist Commonwealth. 

Britain's opposition, liberal 
and labor press lampooned 
Churchill in cartoons yesterday 
as the campaign for the im- 
pending national election got 
under way, 

Britain was able to avoid a 
wartime election because there 
is no law calling for elections 
at special intervals. Instead, an 
election can be forced at any 
time by the government in 
power* 

Labor has condemned Chur- 
chill for rushing the election, 
since the prime minister still 
had sufficient majority to 
carry on when their members 
withdrew from the coalition.

Supplies Continue to Russia 

Washington— President Truman said at his news 
conference yesterday that Russia would continue to 
receive lend-lease supplies during May and that the 
lend-lease subject was undergoing readjustment which 
did not mean cancellation. 

The president added that lend-lease would be 
handled in the future in a way best for world peace. 

Truman said that although Russia was not fighting 
Japan, the lend-lease protocol with Russia was still in 
effect, and that it was entirely legal for lend-lease

Russia when they had been al- 
located by protocol" and treaty.

President Truman warned the 
unconditional defeat of Japan 
will be a "tremendous task that 
will require every ounce of 
power that we and our allies can 1 
deliver from the bases we are 
now winning and have yet to 
win" in the Pacific. 

He revealed, however, that 
"adjustments and reduction* 
in Allied war production and 
in the lend-lease program will 
be possible" and told the 
American public "the task 'of 
reconversion and reconstruc- 
tion is commencing," 
In his letter transmitting the 
report which covered the period 
ending March 21 of last year* 
Mr, Truman said the Japanese, 
like defeated Germany, "must be 
taught that the peace and secu- 
rity of the world are sacred and 
not to be broken by an aggres % 
sor nation. 

"Now all of the might and 
power of the United States, the 
British Empire, France, the 
Netherlands, and our other 
allies can be brought to bear, 
together with Chinese forces, 
against Japan. 

"Long and costly as the 
struggle ahead may be, it has 
been immeasurably shortened by 
the system of lend-lease and 
reverse lend-lease. 

"With their help, we are 
gaining victory over Japan at 
we have gained victory in 
Europe, in less time, with less 
material cost, and with less 
lost of American and other 
Allied lives/' 

Lend-lease, in little more than 
four years has furnished our 
Allies arms and munitions, in- 
dustrial and agricultural sup- 
plies, shipping and other serv- 
ices valued at $38,971,797,000 
while in reverse lend-lease, the 
United States received by Jan- 
uary 1, 1945, nearly $5,000,000> 
000 worth of supplies and serv- 
ices from the Allies, the presi- 
dential report said. 

Highlight of the report was 
a statement that "the aggregate 
industrial output in this country 
in 1944 was more than twice as 
larpre as it was in 1939, In 
that same period, there was an 
increase of one-third in food 
production. These increases oc- 
curred in spite of labor short- 
ages and growing scarcities of 
materials and equipment,"

Hayden : 

<£ I am deeply greived in the 
passing of Dr. Hayden. As 
former governor and secretary 
of public instruction and for 
some time acting governor 
general of the Philippines, he 
performed his duties well and 
nobly as those of us associated 
with him can well remember. 

"His books on the Philippines

den had never actually ceased^ 
working for the Philippines, 
even when he was with the War 
Department On May 17, 1945 
he became special assistant to 
President Osmena. 

"At the time of his death, he 
was deep in the problem of re- 
habilitation- His untimely death 
has put a stop tc- his life of con- 
tinuous service for our country. 

"Filipinos who knew him 
from our President Osmena^ 
down to the common man who 
read him and profited by his 
labor, grieve at his untimely 
deF.th. His books and works 
will keep the memory of him 
kng in the minds of the people 
of the Philippines."

GROWING AWARENESS 

This war, as perhaps no other factor could, has focused 
America attention forcibly on the Philippines, its problems, its 
people- Out of the joint struggle against a common enemy, 
has emerged, on the part of the general Amencan pub ic, 
idmiration for the Filipinos and a growing awareness ot re- 
;ponsibil!ty. . , , , 

Typical of this attitude is a recent expression voiced by the 
'nfluential Christian Science Monitor, it points out that the 
people of the Philippines served, and served welt, the cause ot 
the United Nations. , 

"They never surrendered to the enemy, never lost taitn 

n America. 

"Throughout Japanese occupation they kept contact^ with 
rhe Allies, furnishing priceless information on enemy military 
installations and conditions. Their guerrilla activities are wide.y 
known and invaluable in helping the return of American forces 
to the IsSands." 

"The Americans," the Christian Science Monitor concludes, 
"shculd be proud to call these people citizens. A bill now in 
Congress offers that opportunity.' 1

lloilo Guerrilla 
Notes Losing Value 

The guerrilla emergency note 
in lloilo province is fast losing 
its value, according to Juan 
Buenafe, acting manager and 
chairman of the lloilo currency 
committee and ex-assistant 
manager of the Philippine Nat- 
ional Bank in that province, 
who arrived in Manila last 
Tuesday. 

Buenafe said the present ex- 
change in lloilo is 10 guerrilla 
notes to PI victory currency. 
It is difficult to purchase com- 
modities in that province with 
emergency notes because the 
people are reluctant to accept 
them. They prefer the victory 
money brought by the Ameri- 
can liberation forces to the 
province. ) 

Euenafe said that the prices 
of foodstuffs in lloilo are as 
high as those of Manila.

Washington— President Truman, transmitting to 
Congress the 19th report under the Lend-Lease Act, 
declared yesterday, 'lend-lease and reverse lend-lease 
must continue as a military necessity to bring an early 
and complete end to this terrible war." 

"Our military strategy against Japan, he said, 
"is to step up our combined offensives without delay 
and to strike repeated and increasingly powerful blows 
until victory-"

Osmena and Tydings 

{Continued from Front Faze) 

Osmena stopped oyer on Guam 
for two days to visit the head- 
quarters of Pacific Fleet Ad- 
miral Chester W. Nimitz. He 
viewed American installations 
Tuesday on Guam, during an 
auto trip around the island. He 
Sgriyetl at Guam M onday, 



President Truman warned the 
unconditional defeat of Japan 
will be a "tremendous task that 
will require every ounce of 
power that we and our allies can 
deliver from the bases we are 
now winning and have yet to 
win" in the Pacific, 

He revealed, however, that 
"adjustment and reduction* 
in Allied war production and 
in the lend-lease program will 
be possible 11 and told the 
American public "the task "of 
reconversion and reconstruc- 
tion Is commencing." # 
In his letter transmitting the 
report which covered the period 
ending March 21 of last year, 
Mr. Truman said the Japanese, 
like defeated Germany, "mtist he 
taught that the peace and secu- 
rity of the world arc sacred and 
not to be broken by an aggros-, 
sor nation. 

"Now all of the might and 
power of the United States, the 
British Empire, France, the 
Netherlands, and our other 
allies can be brought to bear, 
together with Chinese forces, 
against Japan, 

Long and costly as the 
struggle ahead may be, it has 
been immeasurably shortened by 
the system of lend-lease and 
reverse lend-lease. 

"With their help, we are 
gaining victory over Japan a* 
we have gained victory in 
Europe, in less time, with less 
material cort f and with less 
loss of American and other 
Allied lives." 

Lend-lease, in little more than 
four years has furnished our 
Allies arms and munitions, in- 
dustrial and agricultural sup- 
plies, shipping and other serv- 
ices valued at $38,971,797,000 
while in reverse lend-lease, the 
United States received by Jan- 
nary 1, 1945, nearly $5,000,000 r 
000 worth of supplies and serv- 
ices from the Allies, the presi- 
dential report said. 

Highlight of the report was 
a statement that "the aggregate 
industrial output in this country 
in 1944 was more than twice as 
large as it was in 1939, In 
that same period, there was an 
increase of one-third in food 
production. These increases oc- 
curred in spite of labor short- 
ai^os and growing scarcities of 
materials and equipment." 



Washington — President 
Truman's report _ on lend- 
lease to Congress yesterday 
showed the United Kingdom 
received to date a total lend- 
lease worth $12,775,392,000 
— 43,6 percent of the total

Hernandez Expresses Nation's 
Grief in Death of Dr. Hayden 



Washington — Secretary 
Jaime Hernandez, speaking for 
the Commonwealth government 
in the absence of President 
Sergio Osmena, issued the fol- 
lowing statement yesterday on 
the death of Dr, Joseph Ralston 
Hayden t m 

"I am deeply greived m the 
passing of Dr- Hayden. As 
former governor and secretary 
of public instruction and for 
some time acting governor 
general of the Philippines, he 
performed his duties well and 
nobly as those of us associated 
with him can well remember. 

"His books on the Philippines 
are known to many. Dr. Hay- 



den had never actually ceased 
working for the Philippines, 
even when he was with the War 
Department. On May 17, 1945 
he became special assistant to 
President Osmena. 

"At the time of his death, he 
was deep in the problem of re* 
habilitation. His untimely death 
has put a stop to his life of con- 
tinuous service for our country. 

"Filipinos who knew him 
from our President Osmena, 
down to the common man who 
read him and profited by his 
labor, grieve at his untimely 
death. His books and works 
will keep the memory of him 
long in the minds of the people 
of the Philippines."

only enough gasoline to make 
such a hop if they fly an 
absolutely straight noiuse, 
Therefore, the Superfc-rts were 
sent along to shepherd the

^Vhen asked when Philip- 
nine Congress" would be con- 
vened, the President said 
that he understood that the 
100-day regular session ex- 
pires today. "But," he add- 
"you can quote me on 
this: I'll call them in special 
session in eight or ten days." 

President Osmena also re- 
pealed that in America and in 
•the minds of most American 
leaders, "independence is a set- 
tled question." When asked if 
the date of independence had 
alreadv been fixed, he said: 
«That will be agreed upon by 
both nations but it won't be 
later than July 1946." 

When asked if the survey of 
the Tydings committee might 
affect the date of indepen- 
dence, the President explained 
that the object of the Tydings 
mission was "mainly in the 
economic field." 

Regarding the question of 
military and naval bases in the 
Philippines for the United 
States, the President said that 
he was in favor of it. "I am 
ready to take this matter up 
with the people because I think 
it will be to the mutual ad- 
vantage of both countries. I 
have always been in favor of it 
even since before." 

He revealed that he was 
impressed with the progress 
being made in Guam and the 
fantastic might of that naval 
base. "It is tremendous and 
the stronger they make it the 
better for us." 

The President also stated 
that regarding the rights of 
Americans in the Philippines 
after independence, he wants 
Americans to feel that "the 
Philippines is also their home. 
He said "there is a special re- 
lationship between the two 
•countries." 

When asked what position 
Hoxas would hold in the gov- 
ernment, the President replied 
that Roxas has several choices. 
He indicated that in the Unit- 
ed States, most people prefer 
to wear the uniform. "Senators

W,li Rebuild 
Ruined Cities 

"Though most of the 
towns in Mindanao and Sulu 
were destroyed, including its 
flourishing industries, as a re- 
sult of military operations, we 
shall rebuild them and make 
them more progressive than 
they used to be," Commissioner 
Teopisto Guingona of Mindanao 
and Sulu declared in Malaca- 
nan yesterday. 

Mindanao, being the future 
granary of the country, will no 
doubt attract the attention of 
investors after complete peace 
has returned, Guingona said. It 
will be one of most important 
business centers in the Philip- 
pines on account of its unlimit- 
ed production of high quality 
hemp, copra, rice, ramie and 
livestock, he added. 

Guingona said that before 
the outbreak of the war Min 
danao had a population of a 
little more than 3,000,000 peo- 
ple. There is enough room in 
that island for even 20,000,000 
more people, he said. After the 
war, the government will re 
sume its campaign of attract 
ing settlers and immigrants to 
Mindanao to populate the vast 
stretches of fertile lands that 
have lain idle all these years 



Fiesta Planned 

A two-day "victory celebra 
tion in honor of liberation 
forces" will be at General Trias,

ing Star" and is reported, unofficially, to have a top 
speed of 800 miles an hour, capable of climbing higher 
than any other plane, and a range comparable to that 
of the best propeller-driven fighter. " 

■ Aerodynamically it is the 

cleanest plane ever built. It 
not only "climbs like a homesick 
anger' but cuts through the air 
on a level flight as would a 
knife. 

The "Shooting Star" has no 
such obstructions as a propeller 
radiator cooling system, pro- 
truding exhaust pipes or super- 
chargers. It is painted the 
color of skimmed milk, with no 
rivets showing or felt through 
its slick veneer. 

The new mechanical marvel 
of the air already is a legend 
because of its great speed. 
Those .who have viewed it, whiz- 
zing over head at low level, say 
that the average person instinc- 
tively looks the wrong way foi 
the plane to stop. The reason 
for this is that at top speed the 
sound of an approaching plane 
follows instead of precedes the 
stop. The P-80 makes a noise 
in the air something like that 
of a loud oil furnace. 

It isn't necessary to warm up 
a P-80. A single spark plug 
puts its engine in operation. 
The engine is mounted behind 
the pilot's comfortable compart- 
ment. It sucks air through 
scoops, mixes air with the kero- 
sene fuel, ignites and compres- 
ses it, and eventually ejects it 
from the tail of the plane. Un- 
like a P-59 and German and 
English jet planes, a P-80 gives 
off no smoke. 

The "Shooting Star" has no 
vibration, can increase speed 
greatly without a quiver, and 
can climb just about vertically. 
Curiously enough, it takes oxy- 
gen rather slowly, picking up 
speed as the air grows thinner. 

A veteran flier of the 14th 
Air Force said, after his first 
flight, that the P-80 "was easy 
to fly", explaining that it is so 
smooth and quiet "that you can 
talk in a normal voice with the 
engine going full blast." 

The "Shooting Star" made a 
practice pass at a B-29 recent- 
ly, coming in so fast that not 
one man on the Superf ort ( saw 
the plane approach or disap- 
pear. 

It was disclosed that the 
"Shooting Star" isn't measured 
by horsepower but by pounds of 
thrust and that it has no igni- 
tion system. A red hot plug 
continually ignites the kero- 
sene and air, producing constant 
power and no chugging.

Okinawa— Okinawa will be made one of the j*

have a development program already under way for 
that purpose, a press dispatch said yesterday. 

The Japanese are making a feeble effort to bomb 
American-held Okinawan airfields but they are neither 
delaying the development program nor disrupting the 
normal operations, the dispatch disclosed.

Former puppet premier 
Norway, Vidkun Quisling, will 
be charged with treason at a 
preliminary hearing, Norway's 
attorney general, Sven Arntzen, 
said Wednesday, according to a 
uews dispatch. 

The stale prosecutor said the 
charge would be temporary, and 
would be made only to hold 
Quisling in jail until trial time. 
Then the charge may be changed 
upon investigation of material 
to be presented by the state. 

The trial of 89-year old for- 
mer Vichy chief of state, Mar- 
shal Petain, on treason charges 
is expected to start in June, a 
Ministry of Justice official de- 
clared yesterday. 

Meanwhile, a War Crimes 
Commission spokesman in Lon- 
don said that thousands of 
persons, including some Japan- 
ese, were labeled war criminals 
by the commission. 

There has been no official an- 
nouncement of the exact number 
but the spokesman indicated 
that at least 3,000 have been 
indicted so far.

Shoot Guilty Nazi 
Heads, Devers Says 

Heidelberg, Germany — Gen. 
Jacob L. Devers, commander of 
the U. S. Sixth Army Group, 
yesterday said, "Nazi leaders 
should be legally tried and if 
found guilty shot," according to 
James Kilgallen of Interna- 
tional News Service. 

Devers added: 

"We have got the German 
army. But we have got to get 
all members of the Gestapo who 
put those unfortunate people in 
concentration camps. We must 
destroy the Gestapo type of 
mentality. " 



springboard from- which the 
final battle of the Pacific war 
will be launched. What they 
do not know is how long it will 
take American ingenuity to con- 
vert this strategic island into a 
base which will heavily contri- 
bute to their complete destruc- 
tion. 

In 50 days, Navy Seabees and 
army engineers have changed 
Okinawa's landscape so much 
that even natives get lost on 
new roads and scarcely recog- 
nize their own countryside. 

U. S. construction units have 
undertaken the biggest single 
military construction job of the 
war, including Europe. It in- 
volves enough engineering troops 
to make a small army. 

Commander Wallace M. Dil- 
lon, overall director of the air- 
field development said the 
program was being increased 
daily as Okinawa's possibilities 
became more and more apparent. 
Dillon said: 

"This island will have more 
airfields than any which we 
have taken before in the 
Pacific. The airstrips will be 
of semi-permanent construction 
strong enough for our military 
operations," adding. 

"The airbase, which will be 
one of the largest in the world 
will also possess a seaplane base 
and will be one of the best 
equipped in the Pacific." 



Jap Prisoners Get 
Religious Freedom 

Honolulu — Japanese on cap- 
tured Pacific islands have ex- 
perienced religious freedom 
since the arrival of U. S. troops, 
according to Col. O. J. Cohee, 
Theater Chaplain of the U. S. 
Army Forces in the Pacific., 
a Wednesday news dispatch 
said. 

Islanders throughout the Pa- 
cific islands may worship m 
whatever way they please but 
the fact is a high proportion of 
them have adopted Christianity 
in past years from missionaries, 
mostly from Britain and the 
United States, Cohee said. 

He added that Japanese 
Budhists on Saipan, for ex- 
ample, are free to worship at 
their own services conducted by 
priests of their own faith.

Caught by Ya*ks 



Berchtesgaden, Bavaria — 
Julius Streicher, former gaulei-

Franconia, and bitter anti- 
semite in Hitler's Nazi regime, 
was captured yesterday on a 
farm in the Bavarian hills by 
officers of a U. S. 'airborne

Seized near Waldring, about 
40 miles west of Berchtesgaden, 
Streicher was turned over to 
the U. S. 15th Corps in the same 
general area where Goering and 
other Nazi leaders were lately 
seized. 

Gen. Ritter Von Epp, one time 
minister for the German col- 
onies, later governor general of 
Bavaria and defender of Mu- 



nich, was also said to be a 
custody.

Japs Throttle AH Speech 



SAN FRANCISCO — In a sweeping move 
equalling the worst restrictions clamped 
down on Germany during the height of 
Hitler's regime, the procurator general of 
Japan yesterday demanded rigid "control 
of speech" and "indiscriminate arrests" of 
all violators. 

This announcement was coupled with an 
admission that "peace agitation" was spread- 
ing throughout the homeland, plus uneasiness 
over Germany's surrender, and the "increas- 
ing free intensity of enemy raids." 

According to Domei, as recorded by Fed- 
eral Communications Commission monitors 
here, a complete muzzling of all Japanese 
thinking was proposed by Procurator General 
Nakano, at a meeting of presidents of the 
Japanese court of appeals and chief public 
procurators called by Premier Suzuki. 



Nakano said, in part: 
"In regard to ideological violations, the 
first thing to be stressed is control of speech 
and action agitating peace. There is a ten- 
dency toward speech agitation and speech 
on the criticalness of war, sharp changes!" 
international rela+ions and increasing fr ee 
intensity of enemy raids. 

"Arrests should be made in cases of any 
speech which might cause discord. Arrests 
should be made indiscriminately and these 
violations should be checked immediately- 
The recent state of moral corruption cannot 
be ignored." 

He also emphasized critical food short- 
ages, and cafled for a severe crackdown on 
hoarding. "Present economic conditions- 
he admitted, "allow for no optimism, and*" 15 1 
year's food conditions call for due consider- 
ation

THE RUSSIAN ARMIES 

Russia, America's powerful ally during the Battle of Europe, 
nd a working partner in the United Nations effort to secure a 
istlng peace, continues to maintain her victorious armies. 

There has been no general demobilization, no swift cutback 
•#m war to peace. Recent news dispatcher, on the contrary, 
jveal that "the Red Army Is now in the midst of the greatest 
■alnlng period in Its existence," 

This is especially true, according to dispatches, of far-flung 
ovlet garrisons in Siberia, where Russian territory borders on 
span's conquests in Manchuria* 

Against a backdrop of long-strained relations between 
a pan and Hifc Soviet, these military maneuvers of Russia's 
iberlan troops take on added significance* 

The armies which absorbed the full force of the Wermacht 
f its prime, which rolled the Sermans back from Stalingrad to 
erlin under the grimmest possible conditions, and which fed, 
laintained, .ind supplied the largest fighting force in Europe 
vcr vast land distances — these armies under Josef Stalin will 
ear watching in the months to come.

The acting secretary of war 
paid tribute to the brilliant re- 
cord of the First Army in 
Europe, saying its "professional 
accomplishments and the cour- 
age and skill of its officers and 
men are second to none." 

Reviewing operations in the 
Pacific, Patterson said, "liquida- 
tion of the enemy in the Philip- 
pines is proceeding with com- 
parative swiftness. The fanati- 
cal Japanese defense of Okina- 
wa cannot hold out a great deal 
longer/' 

Patterson added: "The Allied 
victory in Burma has been em- 
phasized by the swift develop- 
ment of mopping up operations, 
while in central and south China 
the Chinese have substantially 
improved their positions." 

Discussing forces in the Paci- 
fic, Patterson declared, "No one 
knows better than the army 
troops and marines on Okinawa 
how tough is the Japanese de- 
fense and how stubborn is their 
resistance born of desperation. 

"It is another clear notice," 
he continued, "of what we are 
up against as we carry the war 
to Japan. But the essential fact 
of the situation is that our men 
have pushed forward courage- 
ously and irresistibly though the 
advance has been slow and dif- 
ficult"

yesterday. Four more PCaU

Asked whether tr uislcr

munity distributors, or outright 
elimination of some, De Castro 
said the present set-up will be 
retained as much as possible,

Some Europe Veterans Will Train 
In America Before Moving to Pacific 



WASHINGTON — Certain veterans of the Euro-^ 
oean campaign, slated for reassignment to the Paci- ! 
fic theater, will undergo training in this country or 
in Europe preparatory to moving to war against 
Japan, the U. S, War Department announced Thurs- 

Units scheduled for re-deployment will receive 
a maximum amount of training allowed by the opera- 
tions time table. Whether conducted in Europe or 
in the United States, all re-deployment will be direct- 
ed toward one objective — to improve the preparation 
,0f veterans of the German war to meet their new 
enemy by acquainting them with Japanese weapon*, 
tactics, climatic conditions, terrain and health con- 
ditions, encountered in Pacific areai. 

*> Training troops to ke*p 
selves in good health will be 

an important aspect in pre- 
paration for re-deployment of 
our main forces, it was an- 
nounced* So far, application 
of preventative medicine, 
coupled with the Army's health 
instructions to its troops, have 
kept deaths from illness among 
forces in the Pacific at less 
than the normal death rate 
from sickness. 

Lack of bases and adequate 
facilities in Pacific areas call 
for larger proportional num 
hers and greater exertions of 
service troops. Some return- 
ed units will be converted to 
specialties required in expand- 
ing the Army's supply line to 
the Pacific, 

Re-deployment training of 
Army air forces personnel in 
this country will consist large- 
ly of training of air crews on 
new equipment which they will 
use in the Pacific. 

For the last several months 
crews of heavy bombers, 
B-17 J s and B-24% have been 
returning from Europe for the 
transition training in very 
heavy bombers such as B-29's 
and B-32's. The flow of air 
crows to the Pacific will con- 
tinually increase. 

In laying out its huge re- 
deployment program, the Army 
has taken full advantage of 
combat logistic experience 
gained thus far in all war 
theaters. Battle experience has 
proved that our basic training 
' policy is sound and equally 
applicable to fighting in Eu- 
rope and the Pacific* 

To the maximum extent pos- 
sible, all training installations 
will be staffed by instructors 
who have had combat expe- 
rience against Japan, The 
training will be tough, realis- 
tic and full use will be made 
of lessons learned in battle.

Transport 
to Fix 



Principles 

T0BNNI8TEIN, GERMANY 

— Br, Hans Fuchs, in his 
first public statement as 
German administrator of 
the TJ. S. 15th Army's oc- 
cupation zone, yesterday 
voiced a plea for German 
people ^to relearn princi- 
ples of brotherly love/' 
press dispatches said, 

Fuchs, 70-year-old p re-Nazi 
president of the Rhine province 
said it would take the "com- 
bined efforts of all 1 of us" to 
"rid Nazi thoughts from our 
peoples minds*" 

Fuchs was forced into retire- 
ment by the Nazis in 1933, after 
he had been president of the 
Rhine province, core of the 
present military district for 11 
years* and a government em- 
ployee under the kaiser and the 
Weimar republic for more than 
30 years. 

Fuchs said he lived in retire- 
ment under Nazism and "did 
not indulge in political activity 
of any sort. Of course I spoke 
critically of the, Nazis in 
private," he said, "but I did not 
speak publicly/' 

He lived in the Saar Basin 
which was under the League of 
Nations trusteeship until the 
Nazi plebiscite was held. "Be- 
cause I had no Nazi flag to dis- 
play when the Saar voted for 
German rule, some Nazis came 
at night and painted an inscrip- 
tion on my front porch, f I am* a 
traitor to my country/ But 
they never attacked me openly, 
I was too well known in the 
Rhineland," Fuchs said, 

Fuchs will be responsible for 
operation of the Rhine govern- 
ment under American military 
supervision* 



heavy industry on a normal basis 
will be the work of at least a 
generation, he said* 

The German transportation 
system, Ross explained, "is in a 
state of complete paralysis, In 
its re-establishment, the Ger- 
mans must start from scratch/' 
He said it may be late fall be- 
fore the wreckage of Rhine 
bridges can be removed and the 
river reopened for navigation. 

"For rehabilitation of Ger- 
man transport/' he said, "we in- 
tend to use German labor and 
materials, The Germans will be 
required to do everything that 
can be done. We do not intend 
to have American soldiers per- 
form functions which Germans 
themselves can perform/' 

Communications, however, 
adequate to service United 
States troops, will be maintained 
until the Germans arc in a po- 
sition to take over*

riot, mayor of Lyons and 
former French premier, who re- 
cently returned from France 
after imprisonment in Germany, 
Thursday thanked the American 
people for efforts "to defend 
the freedom of mankind/ 1 

Herriot's message, broadcast 
over a Paris radio, was a reply 
to congratulations on his libera- 
tion sent him by President Till- 
man and Secretary of State 
Stettinius.

gation could have gathered most 
of the data they needed in 
Washington. "We came here to 
obtain the feeling of things," he 
explained. 

Senator Tydings said that 
what the United States has ac- 
complished in the Philippines 
has won the admiration of the 
whole world. In this war he 
said, "the Philippines has 
proved to be one of the best 
friends we've got.'* 

The senator from Maryland 
declared that the question of 
naval bases and military reser- 
vations in the Philippines after 
independence was provided for 
in the independence law, 

"I am in favor of a strong 
naval base in the Philippines/' 
he said emphatically, "to avoid 
another war. We need a police- 
man in this part, of the world to 
keep the peace just as we need 
a policeman in a town to cover 
the beats/ 1 

Senator Tydings said he had 
no information on whether a 
new U. S. high commissioner 
would be appointed between now 
and July, 1346, He expressed 
beli f that the Philippines would 
be given priority over European 
countries in the matter of reha- 
bilitation and reconstruction

Expresses Grief 

The members of the Univer- 
sity of Michigan Club in the 
Philippines, through Benito H* 
Lopez, its spokesman, expressed 
their sorrow over the death of 
cx-Gov. Joseph Ralston Hayden. 



President pointed out that the 
Philippine Independence law 
bears his name, and that it 
was Tydings, along with Rep. 
Bell who assisted President 
Roosevelt in securing congres- 
sional endorsement of the 
President's plan for protecting 
an independent Philippines. 

"Sen. Tydings/' Mr. Osmena 
said, "believes in our ability as 
a free and democratic nation 
to assist the United States in 
carrying out its peaceful pur- 
poses in the Pacific." 

Speaking of President Roose- 
velt, Mr, Osmena said: 

"His passing represents a 
great loss to the Filipino peo- 
ple. Foremost champion of hu- 
man rights and liberties, he 
unceasingly fought not only for 
freedom of the Philippines but 
also for its security. His name 
will be indissolubly linked with 
the Philippines and his me- 
mory will be eternally honored 
in every Filipino home" 

Of Truman, Mr* Osmena de- 
clared the new U. S* President 
has at heart the best interests 
of the Filipino people. 

"He recognizes the contribu-, 
tion made by Filipinos in this 
war for democracy. He is 
ready to exert every effort to 
give us aid in the tremendous 
task of rehabilitation/* Mr. Os- 
mena emphasized.

SUPERFORTS AGAIN RIP TOKYO 



4,000 Tom 
Dropped 
Newest Blow 

GUAM — Striking for 
the second time within 48 
hours, another great fleet 
of Marianas-based Super 
Fortresses poured 4,000 
tons of incendiary bombs 
on Tokyo's government, 
business, and waterfront 
sections early Saturday 
morning. 

Approximately 500 B-29's 
took part in the latest strike, 
unloading their cargoes among 
ares still burning from Thurs- 
day's assault by 550 Super 
Forts which dropped 4,600 tons 
of fire bombs. 

Returning pilots said smoke 
billowed up thousands of feet 
over the target area from 
buildings supposed to be fire 
and earthquake proof. 
One pilot who arrived over 
Tokyo in the middle of the 
attack said it "was one big fire 
and we could see the glow in 
the sky 50 miles out." Other 
crew members reported strong 
winds swept off Mount Fuji- 
yama's slopes, fanning flames 
toward the north. 

The Japanese radio admit- 
ted that Saturday's attack 
bad practically laM waste to 
Tokyo. It said that flames, 
fanned by 110-mile -a»-hour 
sales, swept throughout the 
city, and that practically all 
of the principal industrial 
district was wiped out. 
Target area for Saturday's 
smash was a six kilometer 
lying between the main 
*;Section of the city and the Shi- 
-idagawa industrial area bombed 
Thursday. 

The new attack on Toky* 
was the 24th by America's 
giant sky battleships. It rais- 
ed to 17,600 tons the weight 
of fire and demolition boiribs 
hurled on Tokyo, Nagoya, 
and Hamamatsu during the 
last 30 days. 

Even, land-based U. S. Army 
fighters joined in Saturday's 
operations. Twelve hours pre- 
ceding the B-29 -attack, fighter 
planes from Iwo Jima roared 
over Tokyo, attacked two 
enemy airfields north of 
capital and destroyed 
damaged 58 planes.

War and Congress Wi 
Determine Extent or Aid 

Sen. Millard E. Tydings, head of President Tru- 
man's mission to the Philippines, declared yesterday 
that the extent of American financial aid to the Fili- 
pino people will depend on the war and the United 
States Congress, Senator Tydings was interviewed 
over the radio by James G. Wingo on the Philippe 
Hour. . 

"We are not here to make promises, said me 
senator from Maryland, v Ifi chairman of the Seri- 
ate Committee on Territories and Insular Affairs and 
the Filipino Rehabilitation Commission. "But I eas 
say this: America wants zo do her part m the reha- 
bilitation of the Philippines withi n reason and m al l 
fairness to the Filipinos. 

"In the allocation of mate- 
rials for reconstruction within 
the limits imposed on all by 
the conduct of the war, I am 
sure the Philippines will have 
a priority over any foreign 
country. I am confident that 
our recommendations will carry 
a great deal of weight. 

"We are still' in the middle of 
a deadly war with the Japanese. 
Our main task is to win that 
war at the quickest possible mo- 
ment. Anything which handicaps 
that purpose will prolong the 
struggle. That is why more 
relief can not be brought here 
quickly. It would be easy to 
bring aid to the Filipino ^people

RAISING QUESTIONS 

The Japanese man en the street, or what is left of some of 
■e pan's fcnest sfresls, must fce mora than jusr a Jittl© bit puzzled, 

For the last eight months, beginning with Genera! Mac- 
\r+hur's landings on Leyhs, he has been subjected to a confusing 
>arrage of grim warnings by various Japanese spokesmen, 
iromieft, commentators and respecteci generals. 

These warnings followed a tragic pattern* During the baftta 
if Leyte. he was told that Japan's rise or fall would depend on 
lie outcome of the battle of Leyte. Tta Jap was smashed o*r 
.cyte„ 

During the bat He of Luxor, he was toid that the fata of 
I entire Pacific war would be decided in the Battle of Luton 
tnd the defense of Manila, The Jap was crushed an Luzon; 

During the battle of Iwo Jima, and now Okinawa! these 
ixact phrases ware hauled out, dusted off, and employed with 
he same lavifihness- The Jap wan erased from Iwo Jim* snd 
% (it the process of elimination from Okinawa. 

Taking the utterances of his own leaders at their word, the 
/upaness man on the street Is forced into .the unhappy decision 
rfiat the war issue nc longer is in doubt— 4k&f Japan'? rise or 
WJ truly was decided in the defeats at Leyte, Luzon, etc, 

Perhaps this helps explain why .the procurator genera! jf

30 Percent in Next 6 Months 

WASHINGTON — XL S. airplane production for

^nes that fought in Europe 
nil Ggiit against the Japanese. 

«We do not propose to ask 
lor more aircraft than are nec- 
essary for successful prose- 
cution of the war. We are 
'nerefore cutting back produc-

'Heinrich Himmler "lay sprawled 
in dishonored death" in a 
thoroughly disordered room 
shortly after his suicide, Frank 
Conniff, International News 
Service, reported. 

T^his correspondent saw 
Himmler soon after he had 
swallowed the lethal potion to 
escape Allied justice. 
He wrote: 

"Himmler lay sprawled in 

dishonored death inside the two 
story brick building to which he 
had been taken by the British 
after his capture. 

"He reached his end in a room 
as disordered as the world which 
his master reiehsfuehrer of Nazi 
i Germany had conjured up from 
\ the blood and agony of Europe's 
suffering millions, 

"Chairs were piled over -one 
another. Torn rugs cluttered 
corridors. 

4 'On the floor was water which 
had dropped from a tin hasin 
into which Himmler had coughed 
his last, 

"And in the middle of this 
disarray, covered by a G. I. 
blanket, lay the erstwhile school 
teacher who had abandoned his 
books to become the' chief archi- 
tect of Nitzi savagery," 

Meanwhile, Himmler'a cur- 
rency hoard > valued at about 
51 f 000,000 was found Friday 
under a barn near Berchtes- 
gaden by U< S, troops, a press

men, who said he had buried the 
money on Hitler's orders al* 
though it belonged to the Reich, 
American^ found the hoard 
contained currency of 26 coun- 
tries, but none from the United

Included were two Argentine

Food Sought 
For Bombed 
Bangued Folk 

The people of Bangued, cap- 
ital of Abra, lost their homes, 
food and clothing in the bomb- 
ing of the town preparatory lo 
its occupation by guerrillas in 
April, and are greatly in need 
of relief to stave off starvation, 
Maj, Fidel Soliven, retired, 
who arrived recently from the 
province, declared Saturday. 

Soliven said that many of fhfe 
residents who have relatives in 
other provinces and in Manila 
have- left the town, but that 
the government must Jook after 
and help many more who re- 
main there, 

About 99 per cent of the 
buildings were wrecked and 
burned and some 500 civilians 
were lulled in the bomb lag, he 
revealed. The survivors have 
not only lost their homes but 
also their stocks of pa Lay and 
clothing. 

Relief should be tent imme- 
diately to Eangued, Soliven 
said, as the people cannot ob- 
tain help from neighbor Ln^ 
towns, which were robbed of 
palay by the Japanese, 

According to Soliven, there 
were not many Japanese in 
Bangued during the bombing. 
He pointed out that the civil- 
ians failed to heed a warning 
of the bombing brought by 
guerrillas ten days prior to the

Army Assumes 
Full Control 
Of Retch News 

PARIS — Brig:. Gen. Robert 
A, McClure, chief of the psy- 
chological wax-fare division at 
Allied headquarters, Saturday 
said that his division had as- 
sumed complete control of 
German information services 
until Nazi and militarist in- 
fluence in Germany have been 
eliminated. 

McClure said: "The program 
embraces all news and radio 
transmitters, and publishing 
and entertainment enterprises 
m those areas controlled by the 
Allied Supreme Command/' 

According to McClure, the 
psychological warfare division 
has divided its operations into 
the following three phases: 

One — shutting down all Ger- 
man information services. 

Two — instituting Allied in- 
formation services utilizing 
newspapers, publishing plants 
and radio. 

Three — gradual transition 
from Allied information serv- 
?eofl to German-managed serv- 
ices \inder Allied supervision. 



Train Filipinos 
Heavy Machinery 

For the two-fold purpose of releasing a substan- 
tial number of specialized personnel in the U. S. 
Army in the Philippines for duties elsewhere and in 
preparation for employment of both heavy and 
mechanized equipment for the reconstruction pro- 
gram of the Commonwealth government, a school has 
been opened by the General Engineer District to train 
Filipinos to operate heavy and mechanized units, it 
was learned yesterday from Col. K. C, Hunter, com- 
manding officer of the General Engineer District. 
Col. Hunter disclosed the$ 



training program has been go 
ing on during the past month 
on an experimental basis and 
has been found highly success- 
ful. The project is being han- 
dled by the Training Branch of 
the General Engineer District. 

The course includes opera- 
tion, maintenance and repair 
of heavy mechanized equip- 
ment like the bull-dozers, 
heavy-duty trucks, concrete 
mixers and others necessary 
for the reconstruction of the 
Philippines. 

The technique followed in 
teaching Filipino trainees is 
knowri as the "On the Job" 
system, Under this set-up, two 
trainees are assigned for in- 
struction on each piece of 
equipment which is actually on 
the job. The "operator-in- 
charge" keeps track of the 
progress of each trainee who is 
graduated on recommendation 
of the operator. 



To step up the training pro- 
gram, the first graduates will 
be used as instructors. The em- 
ployment of the graduates is 
assured, but to prevent partial- 
ly trained operators from quit- 
ting before graduation in order 
to look for employment else- 
where, trainees seeking separa- 
tion before they have been 
thoroughly trained will be in- 
vestigated. The trainees will be 
given appropriate certificates 
upon their graduation. 

The Training School will 
draw its material from an Em- 
ployment Office located on the 
ground floor of the Terminal 
Building across the street from 
the former Ayuntamiento 
building in the Walled City. A 
selective process will be adopt- 
ed so that a trainee will be 
trained on just the right piece 
of equipment compatible with 
his previous training and ex- 
perience and mental capacity.

chairman of the American Red 
Cross, arrived in Manila yester- 
day morning on the last leg of 
his tour of the Southwest Pacific 
Army and Navy bases. 

En route to Manila, National 
Chairman O'Connor visited 
Honolulu, Guam, Tinian, Saipan 
and Kwajalein, where he con- 
ferred with ranking Army and 
Navy officials about the anti- 
cipated increasing needs for 
the Red Cross services by the 
American armed forces.

the Pacific Ocean area, Lewis 
Bowen, national director of the 
Red Cross Public Relations 
Office, and Lt. Cmdr. Walter 
L. Kiley, representative of the

WASHINGTON— The U. S. Eighth Air Force, 
which pioneered American bombing of Germany, is 
going to the Pacific under the command of Lt. Gen. 
James H. Doolittle, the War Department announced 
Sunday. 

The announcement said "the present tempo of 
bombing the Japanese homeland will be stepped up 
to the point that Japanese war industries can expect 
an even greater volume of attack than was 
accomplished against Hitler's Fortress Europe." 



Stalin Talks 

With Hopk 

MOSCOW — Marshal Stalin 
yesterday received Harry Hop- 
kins, President Truman's con- 
fidential adviser, who is on a 
special mission to Russia, and 
U. S. Ambassador Averill Her- 
riman at the Kremlin. Foreign 
Commissar. Viacheslov Molotov 
was also present, the Moscow 
radio said. 

Earlier, Hopkins conferred 
with Allied diplomats in 
Moscow. 

News dispatches from Lon- 
don said Joseph E. Davies, 
President Truman's personal 
representative, conferred yes- 
terday for several hours with 
Prime Minister Churchill at the 
latters country estate. 

Davies will return to London 
today for further discussions 
with Anthony Eden. 



"General Doolittle is now 
prepared to help finish the job 
he started on Japan in April, 
1942, when he hit Tokyo with 
his carrier-based B-25's. Now, 
he will be using land-based 
four-engined bombers with 
plenty of fighter cover." 

It was recalled that General 
Doolittle, in a recent overseas 
interview, said that the Eighth 
Air Force's maximum oper- 
ational strength was 2,400 
heavy bombers and 1,200 
fighters scattered over 60 
airfields. 

The Eighth Air Force made 
its first raid of the war with 
a force of 12 fortresses in Aug- 
ust, 1942, and "from that hum- 
ble beginning it was built up 
into the greatest striking force 
in aviation history," the War 
Department pointed out.

lish Navy and merchant marine 
under operational direction of 
the British Admiralty have al- 
ready gone into action against 
Japan, it was announced last 
night by a spokesman for the 
London Polish government. 

Whether ground troops under 
the command of London Polish 
authorities would take part in 
the Pacific war was "subject to 
plans of the Allied supreme 
command," it was added. 

Meanwhile, the Netherlands 
army, numbering about 200,000 
men is "to participate in the 
fight against Japan," Nether- 
lands Minister of War James

British Version of B-29 In Production 



LONDON — A new British 
bomber, "bigger, better, and 
more up to date" than the 
Lancaster and comparable in 
size to the American B-29 is 
in production and soon will 
be available for use against 
Japan, it was disclosed Sun- 
day night. 



According t o Seymour 
Freidin of the N. Y. Herald 
Tribune, the latest type of 
Royal Air Force bomber has 
been named Lincoln in honor 
of a large industrial city in 
north Britain. It is being built 
in Manchester by the makers 
of Lancaster bombers. 



How many Lincolns will be 
available for combat duty in 
the Pacific and actual speci- 
fications are now a secret. It 
was disclosed, however, that 
the bomber is expected to 
have as great an effect upon 
the Japanese as the Lancaster 
did on Germany, particularly 



with the 11 -ton bomb em- 
ployed in the closing months 
of the European war. 

Among the few details 
available in London regard- 
ing the bomber is that the 
Lincoln will have a special 
equipment for tropical 
warfare. 



Yanks Liberate 
Vital Cagayan 
Valley Point 

American 25th Division 
troops, pushing north- 
ward into central Luzon, 
captured Santa Fe at the 
upper entrance to the 
Cagayan Valley Sunday 
as air operations stepped 
up throughout Luzon, with 
450 tons of bombs drop- 
ped on enemy positions, 
today's communique from 
General MacArthur's 
headquarters said. 

Patrols drove north along 
Highway 5 on Saturday to open 
the road as far as Santa Fe. 
which had been made unten- 
able by the American flanking 
movement along the ridges. 
There was lighting on the 
ridges before the town fell, but 
little opposition in Santa Fe 
itself. 

The 32nd Division penetrat- 
ed the upper reaches of the 
Villa Verde trail, flanking route 
into the Cagayan vaUey, and 
were only three miles from the 
25th Division. 

East of Manila, the 38th Di- 
vision took high ground at the 
confluence of the Bosoboso and 
Marikina rivers several milo< 
from Wawa dam. 

The 31st Division has con- 
tacted the first enemy resist- 
ance encountered since the 
Sayre highway was opened up 
through central Mindanao. 
Troops probing into the hill^ 
discovered the enemy has estab- 
lished a line about five mii<\< 
east of Malaybalay. 

Saturday, Australian troop* 
completed the capture of Djoe- 
ata cape at the northern end 
of Tarakan island. Early that 
evening, the Japanese attemj t- 
ed their first air raid on lara- 
kan since the landing several 
weeks ago. Eight enemy places 
came over the harbor area but 
dropped most of their bombs m 
a swampy area. 

In spite of a low cloud ceil- 
ing, approximately 50 ©-25*8 
flew under the* cloud deck to 
bomb Formosa Saturday, nil- 
ting an oil plant at Byoritsu 
factories at Shinea, and an al- 
cohol plant at Mato. 

NO CHANCE FOR NAZIS

THE PRICE 



The Philippines campaign may go down in the record books 
M one of the costliest Japanese defeats. Yesterdays com- 
munique underscores an unpubticized feature of this campa.gn 
„f liberation by General MacArthur's forces. 

So far, the Japanese have squandered 378^427 men in a 
futile defense of the Philippines which produced not a single 
Japanese victory. In every skirmish, in every battle, the Jap 
has been outgunned, outmaneuvered, outgeneralled, outfought, 
and out-thought. . , 

This figure, boiled down to specific terms, represents the 
equivalent of more than 25 full-strength American combat divi- 
sions. To any army, this loss would be staggering, especially 
in view of the lack of results achieved. Japan, inferior to 
America in manpower, industrial capacity, and resources, must 

feel it five-fold. , . , t l m * 

However, there is another, side to the picture. The libera- 
tion of virtually the entire Philippines in little more than eight 
months was not an inexpensive, bloodless miracle. So far the 
campaign has cost the United States approximately 50,000 
casualties, including some 11,000 men lulled. 

This fact was brought home sharply last week by the death 
Jh action of another American general, Brig. Gen. James ^L. 
Oalton, 25th Division assistant commander, who was killed by a 
sniper's bullet near Balete Pass. , 

His death dramatically Illustrates that Amenca has con- 
tributed her finest in men,, in materials, in time, sweat, and 
blood to make good her pledge to the Philippines.

Roxas Cites 'Gallant' U.S. 
Officers of Underground 



Brigadier General Manuel 
Roxas, in an informal talk to 
Manila newspapermen at the 
home of Cirilo Bognot m Ca- 
loocan last Sunday, said the 
-real heroes of this war 51 are 
-those gallant American offi- 
cers" who braved the perils of 
the mountains and who dared 
the Japs just so they could 
carry on with their under- 
ground activities. 

Many of these men, like Col, 
Straugn and CoL Thorpe, have 
been caught and killed by the 
Japanese, "They fell m the 
night," he said, "without see- 
ing the light of liberation," 

He also cited the cases of 
Crig.-Gen. Vicente Lim f vete- 
ran Filipino USAFFE comman- 
der in Bataan, and Antonio Es- 
coda, newspaperman who were 
both caught and killed by the 
Japanese while carrying out 
important missions for the 
Philippine underground move- 
ment. Gen, Urn was arrested 
by the Japs in Mindoro while 
he was on a leisurely trip to 
Samar- He was ft- the time 
using the name of col. iLis- 
worth, according to Gen. Roxas. 

This does not mean, how- 
ever, he emphasized, that those 
who Survived years of hard- 
ships and struggles against the 
Japs, like Majors Ramsey, An- 
trson and Lapham, should be 
deprived of their due recog- 
nition as heroes of this war.

Krug Outlines 
Partial Switch 
To Peace Output 

Washington— War Produo 
tion Board Chairman JamLT 
^le^TT q yesterday that 

the U. S. is able to undertake 
partial reconversion for expan- 
sion of peacetime output, even 
though it is in the midst of a 
major war." 

Krug said that to assure mili- 
tary production for the war 
against Japan, the War Produc- 
tion Board will continue to give 
top priority to military pro- 
grams. The ^expansion of 
civilian production will use only 
materials not required for es- 
sential war needs. 

"Most of our critical war pro- 
duction problems have been 
licked. The country, in every 
sense of the word, has proved 
itself an arsenal of democracy," 
he said.

Million Repatriated 
By Allies in Europe 

PARIS— More than 1,000,000 
displaced persons from coun- 
tries in v/estern Europe have 
been repatriated through Allied 
army channels since the over- 
all program for returning them 
to their native lands began, ac- 
cording to an Allied headquar- 
ters announcement yesterday. 

It was estimated that 2,800,- 
000 displaced persons, mainly 
from eastern Europe, will re- 
main in German territory con- 
trolled by Allied headquarters. 
These are being repatriated 
with increasing speed. 

A plan agreed upon at Leip- 
zig early last 'week provided 
for the transfer of displaced 
western European persons in 
the Russian zone into areas 
controlled by the British and 
Americans. A reverse transfer 
of Russians from those areas 
to the Russian zone is also 
planned.

WASHINGTON — The Naval Air Transport $ 
Service Command is now operating an air transport 
system directly across the Pacific from the United 
States to Manila, the Command revealed Sunday. 
Shuttle service is also being operated from Guam 
directly to and from the fighting area on Okinawa. 

The air transport system operated by the Naval 
Air Transport Service Command in the > Pacific is 
larger than the combined operations of all domestic 
airlines in the United States. The Command said 
that an average of 50 transports were in the air 
every minute of the night and day. 

Fifteen round trips daily lihk^ 
the California mainland with 
Honolulu. From Honolulu there 
are eight round trips daily to 
Guam, and from the Marianas 
there are three round trips 
daily to the Philippines. The 
naval transport planes also are 
flying every day between 
Guam and Okinawa, ' carrying 
in vital supplies and bringing 
out wounded men. 

In the Philippines, the Com- 
mand is operating an inter- 
island network extending 1,600 
miles. Planes fly north and 
south between Manila and 
Zamboanga and east and west 
from Samar to Palawan. * 

The main line of transports, 
flying 8,000 miles across the 
Pacific from the U. S. to the 
Philippines, was made possible 
by a steady surge of fighting 
forces northward toward the 
Japanese homeland. The Com- 
mand has decommissioned the 
longer routes it formerly oper- 
ated to the south Pacific. 

Reestablishment of direct air 
transport and freight service 
between • San Francisco and 
Manila occurred on May 3 
when a Command seaplane 
landed in Manila harbor off the 
former naval base at Cavite. 
Since then, transports have 
been flying at increasing inter- 
vals, carrying materials for the 
central Pacific punch at Japan 
and also bringing back wound- 
ed men. 

During the last two years the 
Command has been operating 
13 squadrons over 80,000 route 
miles and carrying more than 
335,00 0 passengers. 
DENIES LAWLESSNESS 

Lawlessness is not rampant m 
Nueva Ecija, contrary to Con- 
gressman Manuel Gallego s 
statement, declared the.provn> 
cial board of Nueva Ecija m its 
resolution of May 24. Condi- 
tions in the province, especially 
in the matter of law and order 
have considerably improved 
since the resumption of the 
Commonwealth (Jemnontin 
Nueva Ecija on March 11, the 
board stated. 

The "Christian Spiritual 

Union of the »P^^ 
hold a general assembly at 
Center El Progreso on Juan 
Luna street, Gagalangin, at 3 
on May 30. 



Rice Used as 
Exchange Basis 

Due to lack of Victory Peso* 
in Ilocos Norte, the people in the 
province continue to use rice ai 
a medium and standard of ex- 
change, according to recent- 
arrivals in Manila from the 
Ilocos. 

There is an acute cloth short- 
age and the people are hungry 
for Manila news, it was revealed. 

The U. S. Army is now 
recruiting laborers from the 
province to work in construction 
projects. Approximately 3,000 
laborers were recruited . from 
Ilocos Norte for work in La 
Union this week. 

Ni^ht life is active in the 
province and night-clubs are 
mushrooming to satisfy demand* 
of American soldiers, as in 
Manila, it was observed.

Navy Leader 
Outlines Peace 
Task in Future 

Greens burg, Pa,— 
America "must be willing 
to pay the price of arma- 
ments sufficient to preserve 
peace and to stop aggres- 
sion /' Rear Admiral 
Thomas L. Gatch, judge 
advocate general of the 
Navy said Sunday, accord- 
ing to a news dispatch. 

Gatch said that the Allies had 
destroyed "the European end of 
the Axis" but that fcvo difficult 
jobs remained, 

"First comes the complete 
defeat of Japan and second 
comes the building of a peace, 
he declared. * - 

Gatch asserted that the defeat 
of Japan will be costly but that 
it must be accomplished with 
"nothing short of unconditional 
surrender. 

"Even as the war with Japan 
prop: r esses we have undertaken 
a third task. This is the battle 
for peace, Should we destroy 
the Fascist and Japanese sys- 
tems and still not win the battle 
of the peace, we will have won 
only temporarily. 

"We must be prepared to re- 
ject both now and in the future, 
the easy way, Peace is some- 
thing that must be won. Peace 
like all things of great value, 
requires a great price. To have 
peace we must be willing to fight 
for it/' he concluded.

There appeared to be a

Entire Chinese Army Moved 
By Air From Burma to India 

KUNMING — An entire army was moved by air for the 
first time in history when China's new Sixth Army was 
carried from Burma into China by the U. S* Army Air 
Transport Command, a press dispatch said Sunday. 

The arrival of the army In China was disclosed re- 
cently but its whereabouts is a secret. The Sixth Army, 
tempered in the battle of Burma, is probably the best 
trained and equipped of China's fighting forces. If will 
play an important part in China's counter- offensive opera* 
tions geared to the general plan of battle for the Orient. 

The entire 1 4th Division was flown from China across 
the hump into the India and "Assam training camps where 
it joined the 22nd Division under Sen* Joseph Stilwell in 
the battle of Burma. 

With the Burma blockade broken, the army with all 
its equipment, including horses, was picked up and re- 
turned to China by the India-China wing of the Air Trans- 
port Command. The flight was over terrain often referred 
to as tougher than the famed hump. 



Medics Slash 
Deaths Among 
War Wounded 

LONDON — The death 
rate among American 
army battle casualties in 
the European theater was 
leas than half of that of 
the last world war, Maj. 
Gen- Paul E. Hawley, 
chief U. S. surgeon in the 
European theater of oper- 
ations, said yesterday in a 
broadcast. 

Hawley disclosed that less 
than 100 patients remain in 
army hospitals in ttial theater. 
Virtually all will be restored 
to duty or sent back to the 
U. S. by the end of July. 

Of the 1,375,000 XI- S. sol- 
diers and sailors hospitalized in 
the European theater since the 
start of the war, about one- 
fourth of whom were battle 
casualties, less than 13,000 have 
died. 

The devotion and skilled at- 
tention of medical officers and 
soldiers with the combat troops 
were named as chief factors in 
the comparatively low death 
rate among American battle 
casualties. 

Hawley pointed out that these 
men were the finest of Ameri- 
can doctors who possessed 
ample blood plasma, plus sufla 
and penicillin, better nutrition 
and sanitary controls.

sprinkled with booby traps,

Manila's police force, under the able direction of Col. J. P. 
Holland, provost marshal, is making extensive plans for the 
revolutionary change to right hand driving which will be initiated 
)n Manila and throughout the Philippines this Friday. 

The police have done and will do everything they can to 
deviate what will be a difficult period in the »*fl«*nien* of 
Living habits that have persisted here for nearly 500 years. 

But the final responsibility wilt rest with the public. That 
.mans pedestrians, motor car operators, cochsros, cyclists and 

Kn^irtSut adding the burden of shifting from left to 
rfght hand driving, the traffic tangle in Manila has dawlqpad 
f„to a grave problem. This week's traffic report underlmes 
tust how serious the responsibility rests with the public ,n the 
OKt few weeks. The report discloses that 16 persons were kil ed 
»nd 92 injured in motor vehicle accidents in Manila during the 
first 23 days of this month. , , 

So, watch the signs, drive slowly, be careful-and keep

Truman Asks Extension 
Of Jobless Compensation 

WASHINGTON — President Truman yesterday 
urged Congress to take emergency action to widen the 
coverage of unemployment compensation during me 
Dflriod of reconversion to peace. 

In a special message, the President said: Lack 
of adeauate benefits for workers temporarily unem- 
ployed during the transition from war to peace remains 
■ a major gap in our reconversion program and called 
m Congress "to close this gap," _ 

"I am confident that with %p^f 
pvopriate measures we can, 
avoid large scale and lengthy 
unemployment during the tran- 
sition period," Truman wrote. 
'However, some temporary un- 
*>,, payment is unavoidable par- 
ticularly when total demobiliza- 
tion becomes possible." 

Th& President recommended 
auecifically that Congress, dur- 
ing the emergency period, extend 
scrape of unemployment com- 
wnsation to include federal 
*mp!oyeos, maritime workers 
\m\ other workers not insured. 

Tie proposed coverage te fi- 
nanced entirely by tbe federal 
zovenuuent during the emer- 
lenoy and that benefits should 
Appropriately be administered 
by the states/' 

The President also recom- 
mended that Congress provide, 
through supplementary emer- 
jfoncy benefit programs, mini- 
mum standards for a weekly 
rate for the duration of unem- 
ployment bene fits.

MmiiS? f t n PPme Su S ar Rehabilitation Committee 
^toS? 79 a C? mm °nwealth president promised imme- 
oiate and positive action in rehabilitation of the sugar 
maustry, calling a specific outline of immediate needs. 

Kehabihtation of the sugar industry is vital to the 
economic and social security of the Philippines, it was 
Drought out by the Committee during the conference. 
At least 4,000,000 people directly or indirectly derived 
their livelihood from the industry in 1933, before the 
sugar limitation was imposed, and the government 



derived 60 percent of its revenues from the industry* 
After limitation, 2,000,000 people still depended on the 
industry and the government derived 45 percent of ite 
income from it, according to the 1937-1938 Joint 
Preparatory Committee Report on Philippine trade 
relations with the United States, it was pointed out. 

Due to losses sustained during occupation, the Com- 
mittee cited needs for war damage compensation and 
arrangements whereby U. S. markets would continue 
to be available to Philippine sugar on a basis that would 
permit the industry's survival.

Okinawa Artillery 
Fire Sets a Record 

Okinawa — More than 1,000,- 
000 rounds of artillery, a larger 
number than ever before ex- 
pended in any Pacific campaign 
in the same period of time, have 
been hurled at the Japs on 
Okinawa, a press dispatch said 
yesterday, 

Brig. Gen. J. R. Sheetz, com- 
mander of the 24th Army Corps 
artillery, said the number of 
shells laid down against enemy 
fortifications is comparable to 
that fired in the toughest duels 
in the European theater ot 

W Most artillery shooting has 
been precision firing, Sheets 
said since "no Japanese stay on 
ton of the ground but momen- 
g|il£ You" must blast their 
field pieces out of cave 
positions/' 



Official Emphasizes 
Tuberculosis Rise 

Treatment and prevention of 
tuberculosis in the Philippines 
is a major health problem of 
the government, according to 
an official of the department of 
health and public welfare. 

During enemy occupation, it 
was reported that one out of 
seven Filipinos died of tuber- 
culosis as compared to one out 
of 13 during 1941. Out of 100,- 
000 population 630 died of the 
disease compared to 240 in 
1941. 

Facilities for the treatment 
and care of tuberculosis pa- 
tients are at present limited to 
those at the San Lazaro hospi 
tal. The Quezon Institute Sana- 
torium is still occupied by the 
United States Army. 

The three big X-rays of the 
Quezon Institute were reported 
saved and have already been 
installed there. About 300 beds 
belonging to the sanatorium 
were transferred to San L azaro

Stettinius said the.U. S. deci- 
sion to support the invitation to 
Argentina to attend the con- 
ference did not ; constitute a 
"blanket endorsement" of the 
Argentine government's policies. 

Stettinius said that the U. S. 
planned after the conference, to 
put the Act of Chapultepec on 
a permanent basis by writing 
its provisions into the treaty 
with its American neighbors. 
He emphasized that the settle- 
ment of the regional security 
issue in no way abridged the 
right and power of the world 
organization "to prevent or sup- 
press aggression anywhere at

On trusteeship, he said that 
the U. S. stood firmly for a

In an effort to shed some

A. Roxas was interviewed by 
a detective bureau man Tues-

closed that the . bullion be-

the Commonwealth. 

Gen. Roxas also revealed 
how the fortune came to be 
dumped in the bay in Feb- 
ruary of 1942. 

"President Quezon with the 
approval of General Mac- 
Arthur, informed President 



Roosevelt that the silver 
money of the Commonwealth 
of the Philippines in the 
amount of 17% million pesos 
would have to be dumped in 
the sea to prevent its capture 
by the Japanese,". Gen. Roxas 
stated. "President Quezon's

Roosevelt requesting Presi-

WITH THE SIXTH ARMY, 
LUZON— Troops of the First 
Corps of the Sixth Army 
have killed almost 50,000 
Japanese in north Luzon at a 
cost of less than 10,000 
American soldiers killed, 
wounded and missing, Maj. 
Gen. Innis Swift, corps com- 
mander, said yesterday. 

Gen. Swift said enemy 
tanks have been destroyed 
against a negligible loss of 
American armor. 



The First Corps now poised 
for a drive into the fertile 
Cagayan Valley in northern 
Luzon reached their present 
positions after overcoming 
Japanese resistance which 
Swift said was "so fierce 
words could not describe it." 
The Japanese were cleaned 
out from caves as deep as 80 
feet in mountains nearly one 
mile high in the Villa Verde 
area adjacent to the Cagayan 
Valley. 



EC A to Ration Foody Clothes 
Due to Arrive in Late June 

Approximately 8,000 tons of food, clothing and 
medical supplies are arriving late in June, and 30,000 
tons per month will thereafter arrive, for distribution 
under a rationing system to the people of the Philippines, 

■^Secretary of Interior , and 
Emergency Control Ad- 
ministrator Tomas Con- 
fesor disclosed at a press 
conference yesterday. 

In the same conference Con- 
fesor revealed that the three 
ECA districts are now daily 
serving 289,000 people, distribut- 
ing 40,000 sacks of rice weekly. 

Questioned regarding the mis- 
use of 137 trucks turned over by 
ECA to private operators, Con- 
fesor said they were provided 
on the clear understanding that 
trucks would be used to help 
relieve food shortages in Manila. 
It was pointed out that some 
operators were hauling passen- 
gers and refusing to load cargo. 

Should they persist in viola- 
tion of the ECA agreement, 
Confesor said, trucks will be 
taken away from private operat- 
ors. Rate of freight payments 
also was fixed under the ECA 
agreement.

A LASTING MONUMENT , 

With one-half the world rubbing wounds left by Nazi 
shackles, and the other half looking forward to early and certain 
liberation, this Memorial Day, in which America honored its 
thousands who have died on the battlefields, somberly drama- 
tizes the urgency for wise counsel, straight thinking, realistic 
leadership In the years ahead. 

Civilization, as we know it, has been given another chance. 
Civilization Is recovering from a blow that almost succeeded in 
turning back the docks hundreds of years* A free world, caught 
off balance, has managed to come back from the edge of 
defeat. A free world has snatched from the ash-heap, human 
values like decency, justice, and a way of life which the Axis 
had intended to discard in favor of its "new 11 philosophy that 
might makes right and that force Is the only law. 

The price of this rescue of faith has been costly. Millions 
of lives have been spent. Billions of dollars worth of labor and 
materials have been diverted from constructive channels. Land- 
scapes, cities, cultural and art treasures have been blighted and 
destroyed. 

Associate Justice William Douglas of the U. S. Supreme 
Court has pinpointed the decision all humanity must ponder at 
the dawn of another peace* 

Speaking to a Chicago audience last Sunday, Justice 
Douglas framed his challenge in these words: 

M 0nly people, the determined common people of the world, 
can make peace and keep peace. No international order is 
worth anything unless It Is based on mutual trust, understanding, 
and concern of all peoples of the earth In each other. All over 
the world today, there are people who need the chance to stop 
being afraid, 

"This is the seed time of the future.'* 



Hawaii Sugar Planters Ask 
For 6,000 Filipino Workers 

HONOLULU— The importation of 6,000 workers 
from the Philippines to relieve critical manpower 
shortage was sought yesterday by the Hawaii Sugar 
Planters Association, a press dispatch said yesterday. 

The association asked gov-' 
ernor L M. Stainback for 
authority to act on the project. 
The Philippine Independence 
Act permits the governor to 
approve such immigration, 

The association's secretary 
aaid the proposal we made after 
the planters learned that many 
thousand Filipinos need em- 
ployment to earn money for 
their families and for rehabili- 
tation oi homes. 

Those brought to Hawaii 
would be free to return to the 
Philippines after completing 
their contracts, 

The gravity of the labor 
shortage was recently recogniz- 
ed by the Army and Navy 
which announced that hence- 
forth they would recruit work- 
ers only from outside Hawaii.

dispatches, told me that m ten 
davs he had not encountered a 
single German who had felt any 
guilt over the war. 

"His paper is selling well, 
however. When I saw him, 
there was a line a block long 
outside his office waiting for the 
next edition. Everyone agrees 
that the Germans read papers 
full of Allied news and nejys 
about themselves with an Allied 
slant, but no one has! yet h£ ^- 
arded an opinion on how the 
news was affecting them. , 

"The primary impression that 
both visitors and British troops 
quartered in and about the town 
gain of Flensburgians is ^hat 
they are a surly lot who think 
the Allies are in town by fluke 
and that it will take only a few 
years before Germany is strong 
enough to take them on again." 

"This feeling is shared by 
German troops in the town, 
most of whom have gone down 
from Denmark and who have, 
they point out, 'not been beat- 
en in the field. 1 

"Flensburg was bombed 'one

ing the closing days of the war, 
but otherwise it had not suf- 
fered heavily. There is bread,

"Stores have little in their 
windows but there is more in- 
side. Beauty shops and cosme- 
tic stores, which seemed to 
make up about 40 percent of 
the stores, were- well stocked 
with various aids for beautify- 
ing the "master race". 

"This seems to be in order. 
Aside from children who are 
fat and sassy, German civilians 
are an •unattractive lot whoso 
faces are not improved by 
scowls with which the 1 bolder 
ones greeted Allied uniforms. 

'However, if anything is de-

Bangued Now 
'Ghost Town 

Refugees arriving in 
Manila from bomb-wreck- 
ed Ban&ued, Abra, report- 
ed yesterday that this pro- 
vincial capital is now a 
ghost town and the seat of 
provincial government un- 
der military administra- 
tion had been transferred 
to Pidigan, a nearby town. 

The shift to Pidigan was 
found necessary because of 
destruction of the provin- 
cial capitol and practically 
all privately-owned build- 
ings as a result of the 
bombing of the town be- 
fore its occupation by 
guerrillas early in April. 

Records of the provin- 
cial government as well as 
those of the municipality 
were reported to have 
been destroyed. Loss of 
these records will cause 
confusion later in tracing 
ownership of lands in the 
province, especially among 
those who have lost their 
titles or real estate decla- 
rations. 



Tax Exemption Asked 
Income of Soldiers 

Washington — U. S. Sen.

Service personnel are allowed 
a $1,500 exemption at present. 

Bridges said that he would 
offer the measure as an amend- 
ment to the first revenue bill 
to come before the Senate "to 
remove a distinct injustice in 
our national tax against men 
and women in the armed 
forces."

All they sighted was the 
broken hulks and masts of all 
types of enemy ship sunk in 
previous raids. In one hideout 
on another day, nine small 
craft carrying oil drums were 
discovered, "but were destroyed 
from an altitude of fifty feet. 

"The day we flew over Can- 
ton," he related, "it was report- 
ed that the enemy had at least 
75 fighters stationed there. I 
thought at last we would be 
challenged. The gunners on our 
ships all stood ready for action. 
But — no enemy plaries came up. 
They were apparently earth- 
bound due to shortage of pilots 
or oil or may be all three, be- 
cause not a single Zero at- 
tempted to rise from the Can- 
ton airfields." 

Courtenay also flew over 
Foochow a few days after its 
liberation by Chinese forces. 
The Liberator flew in at 100 
feet, as people in the streets 
waved and cheered. 

The same absence of Jap- 
anese aricraft was true in For- 
mosa, said Courtenay, with the 
same smashed remnants of Jap- 
anese shipping along the coast 
and in the harbors. The 
enemy is depending on strong 
coastal anti-aircraft batteries 
for defense. Courtenay pointed 
out that in Indo-China no 
enemy aircraft attempted in- 
terception of the lone Liberator 
flying in broad daylight far be- 
hind the Japanese lines, with- 
out fighter escort. 

"The work of the blockade," 
said Courtenay, "is of decisive 
importance for the next phases 
of the war against Japan. Suc- 
cess of the blockade which is 
the natural campaign to follow 
the victory in the Philippines, 
spells disaster, dooms the Jap- 
anese forces in China, and 
paves the way for later land 
operations." 



Giant Willow Run P]

DETROIT, MICH. — The big $1,0 
Willow Run bomber plant has about com 
its production of f our-engined B-24 bombe 
will close down June 15, U. S. Army Air 
announced yesterday. 

Willow Run has turned out more than 
Liberator bombers since it went into prod 
late in 1942. 

Last week the plant announced thatfi 
bombers were being turned out every fiv< 
utes on an eight-hour shift. 

The factory reached its highest prod 
level in March, 1944 when 462 bombers 
moved out of the plant in 31 days. 

The air force announcement is in line 
its plan to increase production on heavier 
ers and fighter planes for the Pacific war.

that "our judgment is that we 
can defeat Japan quickly and

Ulio added that the troops 
urgently needed in the Pacific 
will go there directly. He as- 



moving to the

icemen returning home. 

"It is not the intention of the 
War Department," he said, "to

strength from Europe to thp

Special 
Set for 



Session 
June 9 



Philippine Congress will be called into a special 30-day 
session on June 9 at 4 p.m. according to a proclamation signed 
by President Osmena yesterday. 

Since trie general elections of November 1941, and sub- 
sequent occupation of the Islands by the Japanese, this marks 
the first time Philippine Congress will meet jn special session. 

President Osmena is at present preparing a lengthy report 
to Congress on the last three years. It will be the first official 
report of the President on what has transpired since the seat of 
the Commonwealth Government was transferred from Manila to 
Corregidor and subsequently to Washington- 



President Osmena declared yesterday that "I see no reason to change" the 
policy of his administration toward collaborators as defined in a speech he de- 
livered in Leyte last November, "Today after *ix months experience*" he said, 
"I stand squarely on that policy*" 

In Leyte the President had 

stated that "every case should 
be examined impartially and 
decided on h its merits* Persons 
balding public office during 
enemy occupation, lor the most 
part, fall within three catego- 
ries: those prompted by a de- 
sire to protect the people, those 
actuated by fear of enemy re- 
prisals and those motivated by 
disloyalty to our government 
and cause." 

The President's statement 
was given to newspapermen in 
Malacanan yesterday alter the 
Chief Executive met for three 
hours with cabinet members. 

The President pointed out 
that "the question of 'collabo- 
rators* is a difficult but not an 
insoluble problem — provided it 
is not made a political foot- 
ball." 

He said "it should not be 
permitted to result in a division 
of the people which would be 
fatal to the success of our ef- 
forts toward national rehabili- 
tation, reconstruction and the 
preservation of national unity/* 
In his speech over the Voice 
of Freedom in Leyte, the Presi- 
dent said he made clear that 
"not all public officials could 
take to the hills to cany on the 
heroic struggle. Some had to 
remain in their posts to main- 
tain a semblance of govern* 
ment, to protect the population 
from the oppressor to the ex- 
tent possible by human inge- 
nuity and to comfort the people 
in their misery, 

"Had their services not been 
available, the Japanese would 
either have themselves govern- 
ed or utilised unscrupulous 
Filipino followers capable of 
any treason to their people." 

The Department of Informa- 
tion stated the President has 
made clear that "the motives 
which caused the retention of 
the office and conduct while in 
office, rather than the sole fact 
of its occupation, ought to be 
the criterion upon which such 
persons will be judged,"

a chain of defeats have caused 
a series of Japanese naval 
shakeups. Toyoda was unable 
to prevent the destruction of 
Japanese warships in the In- 
land Sea. He was unable to 
avert either an aerial or a naval 
blockade of the Japanese home 
islands. And it is especiaUy 
significant that the American 
fleet has consistently bombard- 
ed Okinawa's defenses without 
interference from the vessels 
under Toyoda's command. 

"Personnel changes have had 
no important effect on Japanese 
strategy in the past. There is 
no indication that the present 
shift will make any startling 
differences. Japan has lost the 
initiative at sea. Japan no long- 
er possesses the naval resources 
to mount an effective offensive 
action. Japan's defensive sea 
strength is progressively dimi- 
nishing before our carrier and 
land-based planes. 

"Japan's inability to convoy 
vital material from conquered 
areas has so dwindled, accord- 
ing to reliable sources, that 
they have been unable to move 
a pound of rice from Indo- 
China for many months due to 
American submarine activity."

Catholic schools and colleges 
of the Philippines wul cooper-

realize the present program of 
the Office of Private Education 
of maintaining academic stand- 
ards of all private institutions 
on a high level, Rev. Bonifacio 
Axtman, O.S.B., chairman of 
the Catholic Educational Asso- 
ciation of the Philippines, has 
assured Supt. Antonio Isidro. 

Mr. Isidro declared that mea- 
sure is being taken to assure 
students, the equal if not the 
superior of pre-war academic 
levels of instruction. For this 
reason, he stated, classes may 
even be held in "non-standard" 
rooms, provided health of stu- 
dents is safeguarded. The Office 
of Private Education also is 
conducting qualifying examina- 
tions for students whose records 
have been lost, validating ex- 
aminations for scholastic work 
done outside of authorized in- 
stitutions, entrance examina-

expressed to the suggestion. 

The suggestion was made by 
delegates from China and Bra- 
zil. It was warmly supported by 
delegates from United King- 
dom, the United States, the 
Soviet Union, France, Austra- 
lia, Egypt, Canada, Belgium, 
Norway and many smaller 
nations. 

Dr. Zceiming Sze, the Chinese 
delegate, said that it was the 
hope of health officials that the 
United States would call a con- 
ference within the next three 
months when the new interna- 
tional health organization could 
be created. 

The first emphasis of the new 
organization, Dr. Sze declared, 
would be placed on control of 
epidemic diseases and the 



establishment of epidemiologi- 
cal intelligence. 

He said that another function 
of the new organization would 
be the establishment of emer- 
gency field missions to help 
distressed nations in case of 
disaster. Also, that there would 
be statistics and frequent and 
accurate reports on communi- 
cable diseases available for 
world use. 

Other projects of the organi- 
zation include international 
planning of graduate training 
of medical personnel; an exten- 
sive exchange of students 
through fellowships, and the 
establishing of a system of in- 
ternational grants to aid deve- 
loping health works in back- 
ward countries.

It is necessary to save most oi

anese invasion, the treasury de^ 
partment had withdrawn its 
controls and had blocked all 
Philippine assets which ^ere 
located in the United States, 

That situation continued until 
May 26, 1945. On that day the 
Secretary of the Treasury is- 
sued regulations in Washington 
reestablishing freezing controls 
in the Philippines* Under these 
regulations the liberated por- 
tions of the Philippines are no 
longer regarded as blocked 
areas. 

In addition, persona in the 
Islands who prior to the Jap- 
anese occupation were not 
blocked are able to engage 
freely in business deaBags with 
other persons in the Island! or 
other parts of the United 
States, and are entitled to the 
same rights and privileges 
under freezing control as tL & 
citizens generally, However, as 
a protective measure their as- 
sets which are located outside 
the Islands cannot be dealt with 
except pursuant to treasury 
license. , 

One important feature of the 
reestablishing of freezing con- 
trols in the Islands is a provi- 
sion which prohibits export of 
any gold, silver, currency and 
financial instruments without 
license. This is to afford op- 
portunity for examining trans- 
actions in order to guard 
against completion of trans- 
actions which were effected 
under duress or which otherwise 
might have been of benefit to

the seat of Okinawa's kings and 
formerly the Japanese military

Despite heavy rains that 
made the battle ground a quag-

fore the city was liberated last month. 



Grew Expels del Castano 
After Arrival in U.S. 

WASHINGTON — Undersecretary of State 
Joseph C. Grew declared yesterday that Jose del 
Castano, former consul general in Manila, who was 
accused' of aiding the Japanese when they entered 
the Philippines capital, was expelled from the United 
States several days after his arrival in San Francisco, 

The Spanish diplomat, who 
reportedly gave the Japanese 
military authorities a complete 
list of Americans in Manila, 
arrived with his wife and fam- 
ily in San Francisco on May 10, 

American authorities imme- 
diately shipped them to New 



Orleans under strict surveil- 
lance and placed them aboard 
a Spanish ship which sailed 
May 19. 

Mr. Grew said Del Castano 
was refused permission to stay 
in New Orleans until his ship 
sailed. 



In the five months ending May 31, Allied ate 
forces of the Mac Arthur Command sank or severely 
damaged 2,117,482 tons of Japanese shipping in the 
blockade of sea routes from Formosa to the Malayar 
peninsula, a communique from General MacArthur^f 
headquarters disclosed today. 

Virtually sweeping the seas clean of enemy ship- 
ping and throttling supply lines to the homeland 
Allied bombers found their best hunting in the; Shang» 
hai area, where approximately 30,000 tons bf ship- 
ping were sunk in the last two weeks alone* 

Today's communique review-f 
ed the smashing air assault di- 
rected by General George Ken* 
ney, chief of the Far East Air 
Forces, in the past five months. 
Latest tabulations showed 

that American airmen had 

destroyed 1,220 enemy planes, 

flew 113,627 sorties, and 

dropped over 70*000 tons of 

bombs In support of ground 

operations in the Philippines 

and elsewhere. 
In the latest blows, 110 Fifth 
Air Force heavy bombers at- 
tacked Formosa Wednesday, 
dropped 200 tons of explosives 
on Takao. The same day, near- 
ly 25 medium bombers blew up 
50 small ammunition dumps in 
the Shinei area and hammered 
railroads and factories. About 
60 fighters strafed road and rail 
communications. 

In the ground fighting, the 
32nd Division has cleared the 
Villa Verde trail of northern 
Luzon for traffic into the up- 
per end of the Cagayan valley. 
The troops of the 32nd have 
fought without letup since Feb. 
2, hacking their way from the 
lowlands of Lingayen gulf into 
the mile-high Caraballo moun- 
tains. In this campaign they 
have killed more than 9,000 
Japanese and have widened the 
Villa Verde trail from a mere 
path to a roadway for military 
vehicles.

E_D 1TOR1AL 

NEATLY DONE 

In war-wreclced Manila, faced with an almost insurmountable 
job of reconstruction, probably the most significant war develop- 
ment of the past week was the brilliantly executed maneuver 
which resulted in the capture of the Wawa-Wontdlban dam 
Intact. m 

This victory climaxed a bitterly-contested, campaign to 
liberate the entire Manila water system. Ipo and Balara re- 
servoirs already had been captured. In each case the Ameri- 
cans struck boldly, employed Ingenious methods and weapons, 
outguessed the Japanese defenders, and preserved the precious 
structures from destruction* 

At Ipo, for instance, American forces, with the help of 
Filipino guerrillas, showered the Japanese with jellied-gasolme f 
driving them from cover, and captured the huge installation 
before demolition charges could be touched off* 

It is impossible to measure the value of this triumph in 
terms of health, sanitation, and the well-being of the thousands 
now crpwded into the Philippines capital. It has lightened the 
immediate burden of rehabilitation, cut off years from -the 
scheduled reconstruction job ahead* 

The successfully-completed campaign warrants the utmost 
praise and the heart-felt thanks of every Manilan.

Now, they win really learn 
what overwhelming force can 
be,"

station Sherwood, then director 
of the Overseas branch of the 
U, S. Office of War Information, 
explained in the broadcast, 
"We Americans are to join in 
telling the truth of the war to 
our friends in Europe and to 
our enemies."

ed 24,000,000 words in English, 
German, French, Dutch,

ing more than 85 direct in- 
structions from the Supreme

"Hanking members of the

the following pledge in the 
name of the American, British

"We are determined to dis- 
arm and disband all German

The former Undersecretary

"is an agreement among the 
three major powers upon de- 
tailed steps through which the 
objectives proclaimed at Yalta 
can be in practice realized " 

"Military occupation", he 
added, "will make wholly un- 
necessary any armed force in 
Germany other than municipal 
police. Veterans 1 organizations, 
under whatever guise, must be 
prohibited as they were not in 
1919, 

"Every kind of industrial pro- 
duction within Germany which 
can be utilized for rearma- 
ment should be permanently 
eliminated." 

He reiterated that there 
would be no hope of realigning 
the Yalta objectives unless

German General Staff, whether 
at home or abroad, is ruthless- 
ly tracked down.

Hester to Forward 
Report on P J Needs 

A series of reports on the require- 
ments for rehabilitation of the Philip- 
pines will be forwarded to Washington 
by E. Hester, member of the Ty dings 
mission, who is serving as field repres- 
entative of the Filipino Rehabilitation 
Commission, 

Hester's principal concern will be 

with long-range rehabilitation^ 
projects which may be under- 
taken aiter the war. His re- 
ports will inckude requirements 
lor rehabilitation as may be ap- 
praised by military and civil 
authorities. 

Hester hopes to visit liberat- 
ed areas as he is convinced that 
rehabilitation must begin at 
the grass roots ol an agricul- 
tural country* He feels the sit- 
uation should be viewed with 
optimism. The Philippines, he 
pointed out, is a nation of IS 
million people all of whom 
desire to rebuild for peaceful 
pursuits, and "this is their main 
asset." \ 

Rehabilitation, Hester em- 
phasized, does not depend al- 
together on money* Rehabilita- 
tion rests upon stocks of goods 
and services, natural resources*

Immediate Help 
Asked forPhilippines 

WASHINGTON — "The Filipino 
nation is stricken badly and needs quick 
and prompt help/ 5 Sen. Millard E. 
Tydings, who has just returned from 
the Philippines where he headed a 
special mission to study conditions 
there, declared in a statement Saturday. 
The Maryland senator called first 
$»for immediate slashing of "gov- 
1 ernmental red tape 1 ' to end 
delays in "propositions already 
in being 1 ' to help the Philip- 
pines, and asked for "a long 
range program fair to them and 
fair to ourselves, not forget- 
ting all that has happened in 
almost four years." 

Tydings revealed that "we 
have already secured more 
ships for the Philippines* and 
we are trying to aid the quick 
transportation of food, clothing 
and medicine, We are trying to 
aid them in getting their banks 
open and sound currency re- 
stored so that the people can 
do business " 

"So dire are the problems of 
the Philippines as a result of 
war, 1 ' he said, that the mission 
"gave itself over completely to 
the acquisition of such data as 
would aid us in helping them," 
In a tribute to the Filipino 
people, Tydings emphasized 
that in spite of the devastation 
visited on the islands "the Fili- 
pino people , are working their 
way out of this difficulty. They 
are completely loyal to the 
United States, have fought 
bravely alongside our own sol- 
diers and deserve well at our 
hands. 

"They have saved the lives 
ot thousands of American 
citizens and soldiers both dur- 
ing Japanese occupation and 
during our successful recapture 
of the islands." 

He said that once the dele- 
gation had "the picture pretty 
complete," it returned to the 
U. s, immediately to "start

States could pour shiploads of 
money into the Philippines, but 
this alone might make things 
worse rather than better, Hes- 
ter observed. 

"It is goods we need rather 
than money," he declared. 

In discussing the situation 
with a Free Philippines news- 
man yesterday, Hester spoke 
with admiration of the work 
done by the Army in civil af- 
fairs, particularly in the distri- 
bution of essential foodstuffs. 

When asked about ithe sugar 
industry, which was the main 
support of Philippine economy 
prior to the war, Hester said he 
was not prepared to comment. 
"It is tied up with the settle- 
ment of future trade relations," 
be pointed out. 

Possibilities for at least par- 
tial restoration of sugar pro- 
duction to pre-war level now 
are being studied. It is under-

DeGaulle Balks at Submitting 
Syrian Dispute to TSigTbree 



Chiang Urges 
Capital Curb 

CHUNGKING— Gen. Chiang 
Kai-shek told the central com- 
mittee of the Kuomintang Sat- 
urday that "front line troops 
cannot insure victory" and call- 
ed for, among other things, the 
"restricting and regulation of 
private capital/' 

Pointing out that China's first 
task is to win the war, Chiang 
declared that front Jine troops 
'must be sustained by correlat- 
ed political, economic and so- 
cial measures" which "should 
bring our striking power to the 
peak and harness all our re- 
sources for the final effort." 

He emphasized the need for 
Improving the welfare of 
China's farmers and laborers 
*nd called for "the restricting 
«nd regulation of private cap- 
ital" and the need for "hasten- 
ing industrialization," 

Chiang said that China wel- 
comed foreign financial and 
technical cooperation even more 
than in 1919, when Sun Yat 
Sen mapped the program for 
China's development.'

Carrier Planes Hit Southern 
Japan for 2nd Straight Day 

GUAM — Carrier-based planes of the American Third Fleet hammered 
Japanese airdromes, on southern Kyushu 'island Sunday for the second consecu-

ed yesterday. 



It brought the total score for

Several Towm 
Fall in Quick 



Drive South 

OKINAWA— U. S. 10th 
Army troops pushed for- 
ward yesterday in a gen- 
eral southward advance 
on Okinawa, isolating the 
strategic Chinen peninsula 
and reaching to within 
450 yards of the south' 
east coast by nightfall, 
Several towns were cap- 
tured in the overall 
advance. 

Although the 96th Divisior 
sent the deepest spearhead intc 
south Okinawa, the most spec- 
tacular drive was made by th( 
Seventh Division. 

In a swift and v brilliant 
maneuver, tire Seventh 
wheeled the center of 3ts line 
3,500 yards eastward — the 
greatest single gain of the 
entire 65 -day old campaign 
in what appeared to be the 
first sign of a crwmMinf 
Japanese front. 

The 96th Division drovt 
down the center of the island 
from 500 to 1,200 yards, arriv- 
ing within sight of Iwa vLUagt 
in the south central sector ot 
the island and* about four milej 
from the southern coast. 

These gains sealed off the 
Chinen peninsula, zmi at the 
same time brought the 
Seventh Division dougluVet 
within 450 yards of \ht 
southeast coast of Olunav/a, 
where open plains lie befcre 
them. The Chinen peninsula 
controls the Nakagusaka an- 
chorage, Okinawa's largest- 
harbor and former anchorage 
for the Japanese fleet. 

The stifTest Japanese resist* 
ance encountered during f.ht 
day was encountered on the 
western half of the front by th| 
First Marine Division whicfc 
drove ahead against heavj 
machine gun fire ior gains oi 
800 to/ 1,000 yards. The embat- 
tled Marines captured a hill 2QC 
yards to the north of Knbnr* 
village about a mile and t 
quarter from the mouth oj 
Nana Harbor. 

Advances by the Firsl 
Marines and the 96th Division 
won complete control of th# 
Naha-Yonabaru highway, im- 
proving the supply and trans- 
port situation which was on- 
cumbered by 13 inches of rain- 
fall in the latter part of the «laj 



Interviewed at Malacanan, 
Garcia pointed out that the 
American Congress is at pre- 
sent discussing the U. S. budget 
and "that won't be over until 
the last of August. Until then 
we cannot expect rehabilitation 
measures for the Philippines 
enacted," he said. 

However, the senator ex- 
pressed confidence American 
aid will be adequate to meet 
the requirements for rehabili- 
tation of the Philippines. "Pub- 
lic opinion in the United States 
is definitely in favor of extend- 
ing to us the means with which 
to rebuild," he declared. "At 
least I am not aware of any 
serious opposition, whether in 
or out of Congress, to our re- 
quest for assistance."

Continuing, Parrott reported: 
"Today, aerial photos show 
large sections of transport 
systems largely stripped and 
harbors choked with sunken 
ships. The entire Takao factory 
area in the southern section of 
Formosa is probably almost 
completely unproductive. 

"It is estimated that the 
damage done to Takao's prin- 
cipal aluminum plant alone 
will take two months to re- 
pair—even if no American 
bombers hit the section again, 

"Eighty percent of the power 
that ran trains and industries 
has been blasted since March 
23 when a large force of Libe- 
rators, escorted by Lightning 
lighters* wrecked the Jitsugetsu 
hydro -electric plant at Lake 
Tan with 145 tons of one-ton 
bombs. 

"Experts estimate that the 
damage will take at least 
several months to repair and 
subsequent observations show 
that the enemy apparently 
has made no effort to put the 
plant in running order. 

"Also put out of action is the 
Kinaseki Copper Mill and the 
refinery in the northern part 
of the island. Up until last year, 
the mine produced 10>000 tons 
of copper annually, according 
to the best reports, or njne per- 
cent of the total Japanese 
supply. 

M Rail transport on the 
island has been so heavily 
struck that observers have re- 
ported seeing hand cars mount- 
ed on railroad car wheels and 
pushed by laborers along rail- 
road tracks, serving as substi- 
tutes for ruined flat cars and 
locomotives. 

"Little if anything of the 
island's industrial production is 
being moved to Japan," Parrott 
revealed, adding; 

"Air observers report no 
shipping around the southern 
part of Formdsa and little from 
northern ports — one of which, 
Kiirun, is choked with sunken 
vessels — - while what exists 
seems to be mostly all hurried- 
ly built freighters that the 
Japanese turned to because of 
destruction of a large part of 
their pre-war merchantmen; 1 



New 

Washington — The United 
States plans to produce 5,200,- 
000 barrels petroleum a day, 
Ralph K. Davies, th S. Deputy 
Petroleum Administrator, yes- 
terday told a House appropria- 
tions committee on the budget 
of the Petroleum Adininistra- 
tion for War* 

This is the highest rate of 
petroleum production " ever 
scheduled and marks an increase 
of 35 percent over 1940 in the 
U. J3. 

The figures disclosing that 70 
percent of the oil reserves of 
the world are concentrated in 
the TJ. S. and the middle east 
were revealed to "the committee j 
by a chart. The chart also 
showed that the total of proved 
oil reserve in the U- S. at pres- 
ent is about 20,000,000,000 bar- 
rels. This consists of 39 percent 
of the world reserve which is 
estimated at 50,000,000,000 
barrels. , . 

Of a total of 7,000,000 barrels 
produced for the TL S., figures 
were submitted to the committee 
showing that 430,000 barrels of 
production were being produced 
in Iran, Iraq, Arabia, and 
Saudi-Arabia,

did, the office of the Emergency 
Control Administration said 
yesterday. 

The EGA, as it is presently 
organized, is serving 1,200,000

through six EGA units. With 
97 one-and-a-half ton trucks, it 
is hauling 120,000 pounds of 
foodstuff daily, declared the 
spokesman. The EGA collects 
an average of more than Pl,- 
000,000 per week from Manila 
consumers, it was revealed.

Maj, Gen. CMre Chennault 



KUNMING— Maj. Gen. Claire Chennault, com- 
mander of the IL S, 14th Air Force, said Saturday 
that although the Japanese still retain a strong hold 
on the Asiatic mainland, an entire year's campaign to 
form a land corridor of communications and supply 
between the Yangtze River and Indo-China has been 
wasted, 

"I don't believe the Japanese 
can point to a single outstand- 
ing achievement as a result of 
having opened the corridor, The 
enemy threw away troops des- 
perately needed elsewhere," 
Chennault said. 

He added that persistent 
American air attacks had made 
the corridor useless and not 
worth holding* 

Up to Friday, he said, planes 
of the 14th Air Force had 
knocked out 2400 junks and 
10,070 sampans. He said the 
prisoners taken were found to 
be hungry and short of cloth- 
ing and ammunition. 

Chennault said that the for- 
mer U. S, air base at Nanning, 
from whioh the Japanese with- 
4\;$Wi W easily be repaired,

They then paddle the equip- 
ment back to the island.

Cease Only When Japs Surrender 



GUAM— Maj. Gen. Curtis LeMay, chief of thef 
Super Fortress armadas based in the Marianas, declared 
yesterday that '/the bombing of Tokyo and other of 
Japan's large cities is having an effect on Japanese 
norale," and pledge that "we are prepared to set up 
3-29 attacks until the Japanese surrender." 

"We will quit when the Japanese do," he said. 
LeMay pointed out that "eighty hours after the last 
Tokyo attack, we hit Yokohama and just about com- 
pleted burning out that city."

Asks Honesty 
With Russia 

LONDON — Sir Stafford 
Cripps, former ambassador to 
Moscow, yesterday said that 
Britain must show "a genuine 
and honest desire to understand 
and to cooperate with the 
Soviet Union " 

Cripps, who seeks reelection 
to Parliament on the 'Labor 
Party ticket, said that Russia 
has "two alternate forms of 
security. 

"One, consists of a strong in- 
ternational organization i n 
which all countries are against 
fresh aggression. 

"The other is a sphere of in- 
fluence and control which, fail- 
ing a wider system of security, 
will at least prevent neighbor- 
ing states from being used as 
a jumping off point for future 
aggression, as they have been 
used many times in the past." 



Renews Unconditional 
Surrender Demands 

ABOARD U. S. THIRD 
FLEET FLAGSHIP, IN WEST 
PACIFIC— Admiral William F. 
Halsey, back at sea with his 
powerful Third Fleet, declared 
yesterday that "unconditional 
surrender" by the Japanese is 
the only kind of peace the Unit- 
ed States would consider. 

Halsey said that he would not 
be surprised if the Japanese in- 
dustrialists would try to save 
whatever they could from the 
war. Discussing Japanese aerial 
suicide tactics, he declared 
"They're just a damned nuis- 
ance." 

Rear Admiral Robert B. Kar- 
ney, Halsey's chief of staff, said 
that the Japanese air force 
appeared to be finished as an 
instrument o f conventional 
operations. 

Karney said the Japanese 
were suffering, from a shortage 
of pilots, were using obsolete 
equipment, and that their 
stocks of gasoline and spare 
parts had been reduced by 
previous attacks. 



Tokyo is not important as a 
military target but there are in- 
dustrial targets on the city's 
outskirts that we want to get 
at." 

LeMay pointed out that the 
Japanese may follow the exam- 
ple of the Germans and rebuild 
plants which have been des- 
troyed in Super - Fort attacks 
on their capital. 

He said that the objective of 
the B-29 offensive against 
largfr cities is to "unload the 
greatest concentration of bombs 
on the target in the shortest 
possible time." 

LeMay explained that "this 
involves bombing accuracy and 
the necessary punch to smother 
defenses and let fires get a good 
start," adding: 

"We have four types of in- 
cendiaries which vary accord- 
ing to the kind of buildings in 
the area under attack. In one 
Tokyo operation we hit an area 
just southwest of the Emperor's 
palace which included buildings 
of typical flimsy Japanese con- 
struction. 

"In another operation we hit 
the area southeast of the palace, 
where there are buildings 
of modern earthquakeproof 
construction. I think the pic- 
tures show we did about the 
same amount of damage in both 
places."* 



Peace and Quiet 
Returns to Syria 

DAMASCUS— The presence 
of French troops in barracks of 
many towns was keeping tension 
at a high pitch throughout Syria 
yesterday but lattest reports in- 
dicated that peace and quiet had 
returned to many places. 

Damascus, Horns and Aleppo

*ere scheduled to panfde in the 
city and French barracks in the 
f^art of the city will be 
evacuated. Q 



Guerrilla Money 
Olid for Taxes 

Guerrilla emergency notes 
printed and circulated in 
Panay, Negros, Cebu, Bohol and 
all provinces in Mindanao dur- 
ing the Japanese occupation, 
will now be accepted for pay- 
ment of taxes in those regions, 
according to Sec. Tomas Con- 
fesor. Heretofore guerrilla cur- 
rency was not accepted for tax 
payments since no authorization 
had beoji received from Mala- 
canan. * 

Secretary Confesor wired 
governors of these provinces to 
accept only authorized emer- 
gency notes. Ismael Mathay, 
budget commissioner, also in- 
formed treasurers in the pro- 
vinces concerned to accept 
guerrilla money 'for tax 
payment.

Solons Discuss 
Homes for Vets 

NEW YORK— The first use of 
temporary war housing 
throughout the nation by ^ re- 
turning veterans and their 
families at low rents is being 
discussed by congressional 
leaders, and plans soon will be 
presented to congress with "im- 
portant backing," the N. Y. 
Times said yesterday. 

A change in the national 
housing program probably will 
involve a request for an appro- 
priation of 40 or 50 million' dol- 
lars to cover cost of rebuilding 
emergency housing, the Times 
predicted. 

In some instances, the plan 
may call for erection of new 
low cost dwellings especially 
designed for returning service- 
men.

the 37th Division advanced 
several hundred yards Sunday 
against stiffening resistance 
north of Santa Fe, destroying 
three tanks and several strong 
points. In the Marikina sector, 
American forces which have 
swung northeast took high 
ground overlooking Wawa dam 
against stubborn opposition. 

On Mindanao, 31st Division 
troops moving south on the 
Kibawe-Talomo trail crushed 
final enemy resistance at Pu- 
langi river crossing. To the 
south, the 24th Division mop- 
ped up recently won ground in 
the Talomo-Davao rivers sector. 

Heavy, medium and fighter

Saturday on Japanese garrisons 
from Kudat in northern Borneo

He said a great deal would 
depend on the report to be 
made by Senator Millard & 

Ty Gar?fa expressed the view an 
American High Commissioner 
would not be sent to the Philip- 
pines. Garcia added that the 
military authorities have al- 
ready done a good job of repre- 
senting the needs of the Philip- 
pines to Washington. 

Regarding independence, 
Senator Garcia said it was a 
settled matter, so far as the 
United States is concerned. 
"America will give us our inde- 
pendence on July 6, 1946, or 
sooner if we ask for it," he 
declared. "Their minds are 
made up on the matter." 

The Bohol senator hurried 
back to Manila in answer to 
cabled summons from President 
Osmena. His presence is need- 
ed to make the number neces- 
sary to constitute a quorum in 
the senate, scheduled to go into 
special session beginning Sat- 
urday, June 9. Also recalled 
was Congressman Pedro Lopez, 
of Cebu, another delegate to 
the San Francisco conference.. 

Ranks of the senate have been 
seriously depleted. The follow- 
ing seven are known to be held 
^ custody by the military 
authorities pending trial on 
charges of having collaborated 
with the enemy: Jose Yulo,

American forces pushing down the headwaters^ 
of the Cagayan valley in northern Luzon advanced six 
miles Monday, to Aritao, according to today's com- 
munique from Gen. MacArthur. The gain, the great- 
est single day advance since reaching Santa Fe, put 
37th Division troops ten miles north of Santa Fe and 
about half way from Balete pass to Bayombong. 

The Americans met little opposition m their 
advance and overran a strong defense system of caves 
Dill boxes and trenches which had been abandoned by 

^ the Japanese. 

Meanwhile, the 33rd Division 
pushed northeast of Baguio 
along Highway 11 toward its 
junction with Highway 4. The 
American troops were now 
about 15 or 20 miles northeast 
of Baguio along a road leading 
to the Chico river valley which 
enters the northern part of the

WASHINGTON — President 
Truman yesterday asked Con-

lease appropriation for the fiscal 
year beginning July 1 to help 
"bring the conflict with Japan 
to a quick and decisive end."

this appropriation, together 
with the unobligated balances of

Japanese Port 
Handed Another 
Fire Assault 

GUAM — Between 450 
and 500 Super Fortresses 
yesterday spilled approxi- 
mately 3,000 tons of fire 
bombs on the congested 
industrial areas of Kobe, 
Japan's sixth largest city 
and the principal port on 
thfe mainland island -of 
lonshu. 

Yesterday's raid, announced 
by Maj. Gen. Curtis LeMay's 
21st Bomber Command based 
in the Marianas, was the third 
B-29 attack to date on the Jap- 
anese port city. No other details 
were immediately available. 
The latest attack climaxed 
a series of fire bombings 
within the past 11 days that 
set great sections of Tokyo, 
Yokohama, and Osaka ablaze 
in attacks which saw 178,000 
tons of bombs unloaded in the 
greatest B-29 offensive of the 
war. 

Last Friday, Osaka was rock- 
ed by 3,200 tons of incendiaries 
which practicaUy wiped out the 
main industrial section produc- 
ing high priority equipment for 
Japan's war machine. Yokoha- 
ma was hit with the same 
amount of fire bombs on May 28. 

The sudden step-up in B-29 
offensive blows got off to its 
present pace in twin raids on 
the Japanese capital May 24

Experts See 
Post-War Use 
Of Jet Planes 

SWAMPSCOTT, MASS.- 
A whole new aviation in- 
dustry growing out of war- 
time developments in jet pro- 
pulsion and gas turbines was 
forecast Monday at the end 
of a three-day conference 
which brought 200 of the 
nation's top engineers here at 
the request of the U. S. 
army's Air Technical Serv- 
ice Command, 

Brig* Gen, Lawrence C. 
Craigie, deputy chief of engi- 
neering for the Air Technical 
Service Command and first 
American army officer to fly 
a jet plane, said that the U.S. 
would be making a mistake 
if it did not continue its 
research into the jet propul- 
sion field, 

"We have within reach a 
new concept of military air- 
plane which will render ob- 
solete the type of plane we 
used to defeat Germany, 
Craigie said. 

Reginald G. Standerwick, 
let propulsion and gas tur- 
bine expert, predicted that 
after the war low priced pri- 
vate planes, powered by gas 
turbine propellers, and heli- 
copters with jet propulsion 
gases emitted from prope Uer 
blades, can be used for both

Says Military and Civilian 
Relief Needs Grow Critical 

WASHINGTON— President Truman this week 
calling upon the American people to produce and con- 
serve all the food possible, declared that "in this fourth 
year of war the need for every ounce of food which the 
American people can produce and preserve is greater 
than ever before." 

Truman observed that "the supply lines to fee d* our 
troops, and the millions fighting and working with them, 
are the longest in the history of warfare. 

" Along thousands of miles of^ 
these lines, food must be kept 
moving. Our soldiers in Europe 
are eating more canned fruits 
and vegetables because they are 
changing from combat rations to 
regular meals. 

"Beyond our tremendous mili- 
tary requirements lies the task 
of working with other nations 
to help liberated peoples regain 
their strength and rebuild their 
countries. 

"There can be no lasting 

peace in a hungry world. We 

Americans must do our part to 

help swell the nation's food sup- 
ply-" a , 
The president urged that 

Americans throughout the 

nation grow victory gardens and 

preserve the harvest, either at 

home or hi the community 

canning centers. 



Syrian Leader 
Looks to U. S. * 

DAMASCUS — Shukri Bey 
Kuwatly, President of Syria, 
said yesterday that he believed 
the independence and sover-

of a talk he demanded trial of 
French officials whom Syria 
considers responsible for the 
recent crisis in the Levant 

"1 believe in promises of the 
leaders of a free world in the 
noble intentions of Britain and 
the United States to strengthen 
the independence of Syria," he 
said.

NE1V YORK — Dispatch- 
es from Okinawa today \ 
told how a downed Ameri- 
can carrier plane pilot 
was snatched from Kaero- 
sliitna Bay in the Japanese 
homeland island of Kyu- 
shu last Saturday in one of 
the most daring rescues of 
the war. 

While £4 Corsairs circled 
the bay, sealing the area 
from Japanese fighters, a 
cumbersome Navy sea- 
plane landed on the water 
20 miles inland from the 
mouth of the bay* and 
despite anti-aircraft from 
shore j rescued the pilot. 
The action occurred dur- 
ing Saturday's carrier at- 
tacks on Kyushu airfields.

Of 1 SO Victims left to Starve

Fill-

DAVAO, MINDANAO — The skeletons 
nummifietl bodies of about 150 . American and 
Mno* soldiers were found Sunday throughout 
>uildings and adjacent areas of the liberated Davao 
>enal colony by officers of the U. S. 24th Division, 

Callous? Japanese neglect <^f their victims was so 
Appalling that officers recommended that the status 
)f 800 Allied soldiers, listed as missing in action in 
Che Fniuppmes since Pearl Harbor, be changed to 
'dead" or "prisoners of war." 



Some of the skeletons were 
found lying in hospital beds on 
a porch and on an untended 
walk overgrown by wild 
squash. Of the approximate 150 
□odies discovered, some were 
identified as Filipinos while 
others were officially recorded 
as Americans, 

The officers obtained evi- 
dence that the deaths were 
not caused by violence but by 
deliberate neglect and deser- 
tion. It is believed that, when 
the Japanese withdrew from 
the coastal area of Davao to 
prepared positions in the 
mountains, tlicy took the 
physically able prisoners, 
leaving the remainder to 
starve or die of disease. 

From records and other evi- 
dence uncovered at the penal 
colony, the officers were able to 
Tace the history of some 800 
Allied prisoners, 

One officer said; "There are 
a number of wooden buildings, 
jQOst of them in good shape. I 
vent into one which I assumed 
:o be a hospital. In a long ward 
room I saw two corpses on beds. 
One was just a skeleton. It was 
sither unclothed or the clothes 
nod mildewed and fallen away. 
The other was mummified and 
wore a baggy, shapeless uni- 
form such as prisoners might 
arcar. • 

"On the porch and outside 
walk bones were thick. 
They were scattered, and 
wild squash was growing 
around and over the skele- 
tons. It was almost impossi- 
ble to avoid stepping on 
skulls or other remains, 

"Across the street in another 
ouilding I saw another complete 
skeleton lying on the floor. In 
another building a man's skele- 
ton was lying on a bed. On 
-he bed next to it was a snap- 
shot of an American woman 
and some children. 

"One man in my party said 
tie saw one skeleton kneeling in 
a chapel." 



Filipinos were still living in 
some houses of the penal 
coltfhy. Near the colony, which 
is 25 air miles northwest of 
Davao, is a plot marked 
"American National Cemetery t 
1942/' an officer said. 

He counted 20 graves, all but 
one of which were marked with 
the name, rank and date of 
death of the deceased* Most of 
them, he said, were officers,

Monday by Gen. LeMay that

He said the objective of the 
Super Fort offensive is to "un- 
load the greatest concentration

Single 10,000-Ton B 
Strikes On Japan See 

DAYTON, OHIO— B-29 Super Fortra 
that may drop as high as 10,000 tons of 
Japan in a single x^aid are in store for the 
before the end of the year, U. S. Army lea 
yesterday. 

Super Forts are rolling oft the produc 
at a rate that will double their current gtrenj 
Pacific, Brig* Gen.. Orval R. Cook of {he Air 
Service Command's Procurement Division, i 

With B-29 bases being built^ 
ever nearer Japan, Gen. Cook 
said that 10,000 tons of bombs 
—an amount greater by far 
than was dropped over Berlin 
in the closing days of the war 
in Europe — easily could be 



dropx^ed during a single strike. 

"In December 1943/' Cook 
said, "aircraft plants produced 
less than 50 This month 

the plants will combine to pro- 
duce-several times that num- 
ber. And the rate is still in- 
creasing." 

More than 500 changes have 
been made in B-29 production 
to make the plane a "more 
effective weapon of war," he 
said. 

Peak production will be 
reached about the time that 
1,000 plane attacks can be 
staged in the far Pacific, a fact 
indicating, he said, that even- 
tual B-29 attack strength win 
number well over 1,000 planes. 
. Recent study of B^29 activity 
shows a general increase in 
strength of 100 or more planes 
a month.

Allied Chief. 
Carve Reich 
Into 4 Zones 

WASHINGTON — The 
governments of the Unit- 
ed States, Britain, Russia 
and France yesterday an- 
nounced their plans for 
handling defeated Ger- 
many. 

In statements released 
simultaneously in four 
Allied capitals, the victo- 
rious powers declared 
their "supreme authority" 
over Germany, made pub- 
lic the structure of joint 
government which will 
control the conquered na- 
tion for an indefinite time, 
and proclaimed that Ger- 
many's frontiers have 
been rolled back to those 
of December 31, 1937. 

Germany will be split into 
four zones, the AUies announc- 
ed. This included the eastern 
section under Soviet control; 
the northwestern section under 
Britain; the southwestern sec- 
tion under the United States, 
and the western section under 
France. 

FOUR CHIEFS IN BERLIN 
The Greater Berlin area will 
be occupied by forces of each 
power, it was announced. The 
Berlin region will be controlled 
by four commanders, each of 
whom will serve in rotation as 
chief commandant. They will 
be assisted by a staff which will 
supervise and control activities 
of local German organs. 

With Germany's uncondi- 
tional surrender, one of four 
joint statements said, "there is 
no central government of 
authority" in the country. 
Under these conditions it is 
necessary "without prejudice 
to any subsequent 'decisions 
that may be taken up concern- 
ing Germany to make provi- 
sions for cessation of any fur- 
ther hostilities on the part of 
German armed forces, for the 
maintenance of order in Ger- 
many and the administration of 
the country, and m to announce 
immediate requirements with 
which Germany must comply." 

ARMAMENTS GRABBED 

Requirements included the 
placing of German armaments 
and aircraft, munition factories 
and manpower at Allied dis- 
posal. The Allies issued a de- 
tailed description of control 
machinery for Germany. The 
Supreme authority in conquer- 
ed Germany will be enforced 
by commanders-in-chief indivi- 
dually in each zone of occupa- 
tion "and also jointly in which 
it affects Germany as a whole." 

A control council, consisting 
of four commanders, "will en- 
sure appropriate uniformity of 
action" in different zones. The 
council's decisions must be 
unanimous. Under the council

Russians Give Eisenhower 
Hearty Welcome in B( 



BERLIN — General Eisenhower, arriving in Ber- 
lin for the Allied Control Council meeting Tuesday 
received a hearty welcome from Russian commanders', 
Eisenhower was greeted by Russian General of 
the Army Ivan Sokolovsky and General Polutnik 
Bersarin on the sun-splashed Tempelhof airfield. In a 
brief broadcast over the Russian radio, Jie said : 
"It is a tremendous honor for^" 



me to be here and to greet the 
commanders of the great Red 
Army which did so much to 
bring Germany to his knees." 

The American commander 
inspected the guard of honor of 
'the Siberian Infantry drawn up 
in a long line on the apron of 
the airfield. Later, Russian 
troops marched in review. 

After the salute, the official 
party was driven through the 
southeastern suburbs of the 
ruined German capital to the 
Koepenich district, the subur- 



will be a permanent co-ordinat- 
ing committee of one represen- 
tative of each commander-in- 
chief and control staff. Certain 
Germans will advise the con- 
trol council. 

Provision was made for con- 
sultation with other United 
Nations governments through 
appointment by other countries 
of missions to the council. The 
Allies announced also that other 
United Nations may be permit- 
ted by the control council to 
take part in the occupation of 
Germany. 

It was specified that the con- 
trol machinery outlined will 
operate onij while "Germany is 
carrying roast the basic require- 
ments of unconditional surren- 
der" and that "arrangements 
for subsequent period will be 
the subject for separate agree- 
ments." 



ban area taken over by the 
Russians to house visiting 
Allied generals and their staffs. 

The long convoy of limou- 
sines which carried the Ameri- 
can party drove through tht 
deald and silent city. Only peo- 
ple on the streets, over which 
the autos traveled, were sentriet 
and smartly dressed Russian 
women military police. They 
guided the party with signaJ 
flags of bright yellow and red. 

At the head of each street 
leading into those over which 
the Allies traveled, however, 
stood little knots of silent 
Germans. 

Nearly every house along the 
route was decorated with 
American, Russian, British and 
French flags. Other flags had 
been stuck into piles of rubblt 
which dot every block. 

Signs lined the streets con- 
taining excerpts from 1 Stalin's 
broadcasts to the Germans, in- 
cluding the notable statement 
that Russia did not want to en- 
slave the German people. 

The city was silent, so much 
so that the sound of tires on 
the cobbles seemed as loud af 
an airplane in the sky.

EXCELLENT RESULTS' SCGED 



8 Super Forts Fail to Return 
From Latest Assault on Japan 

GUAM— Results of the^ 3,000-ton B-29 fire bomb 
assault Tuesday on Kobe were described as "excel- 
lent," a 20th Air Force communique issued in Wash- 
: ngton said yesterday. 

Airmen returning to their bases in the Marianas 
aaid Japanese air opposition was moderate and that 
flak, which ranged from meager to intense was 
accurate. Eight Super Fortresses failed to return. 

It was the third incendiary 
attack on Kobe, Japan's sixth 



Legion Urges 
Peace Draft as 
Peace Guaranty 

WASHINGTON— The Ameri- 
can Legion called yesterday for 
immediate enactment of a peace- 
time draft as the "most efficient 
and most economical means of 
guaranteeing our national secu- 
rity." 

Such action "would be the 
greatest possible assurance to 
our neighbors in a world family 
that at last America is taking 
jeriously its international re- 
sponsibilities, that the day of 
isolationism is done forever," 
John Thomas Taylor, director of 
the legion's legislative commit- 
tee, said. He testified before 
che House post-war military 
policy committee which has 
scheduled two weeks of public 
uearings on the issue. 

"There can be no stronger 
influence for lasting peace, no 
greater safeguard against law- 
less international aggression" 
than universal military training, 
ie said. 

The Veterans of Foreign 
SVars also proposed to the 
House committee a peacetime 
draft law, hut one which would 
provide military training with- 
out requiring youths to leave 
their home environment for long 
periods.

largest city, and also marked 
the first anniversary of the 
initial B-29 strike at the enemy 
— the raid on Thailand's capital 
of Bangkok. 

Despite air opposition, the 
Super Fortresses cruised the 
skies over Kobe for an hour, 
dumping their incendiary 
bombs on steel works, two 
main railway stations, ship- 
yards and docks. The weather 
was too bad to permit fighter 
escorts to accompany the big 
bombers. 

The clouds broke, however, 
as the formations thundered 
across the Japanese coastline, 
enabling the airmen to watch 
their incendiaries descend 
and the flames mushroom 
out. 

One bombardier commented: 
"It looked like the smoke was 
so high that it ' was pushing 
the clouds up," 

Another said: "The blaze 
looked like Yokohama all over." 

The size of the attacking 
force was estimated at 450 to 
500 planes, with bomb loads of 
approximately 2,800 tons. 

Targets of the bombers cen- 
tered around five general areas. 
They were the westernmost 
section of the city containing 
government railway shops; the 
commercial and business dis- 
trict in the center of the town; 
the heavily industrialized dis- 
trict in which is located the 
Kobe Steel Works; the eastern 
area containing the Nada rail- 
way yards; and the industrial 
suburb of Mikage, just east of 
the city. 

Kobe handles forty percent 
of Japan's ocean trade and 
leads in the nation's ship build- 
ing and in the construction of 
marine engines.

No. 38 



Osmena Authorizes Bank Permits; 
Holds Occupation Deposits Void 



Japs Penned 
In 25-Square 
Mile Sector 



President Osmena, in im- 
portant executive orders yes- 
terday afternoon, authorized 
the Acting Bank Commis- 
sioner to give permits for the 
reopening of local banks as 
soon as possible, and 
declared null and void all 
deposits made to any local 
bank during the period of 
enemy occupation. 

Commenting on the sign- 
ing of the two orders, Dr. 
Jose Reyes, Secretary to the 
President, stated that "this 
action will have the effect of 



hastening the reopening of 
the local banks." 

Under Executive Order No. 
48 which the President sign- 
ed yesterday, "The Bank 
Commissioner is authorized 
and empowered to permit 
any banking institution which 
was doing business in the 
Philippines prior to enemy 
occupation to perform any or 
all of its usual banking 
functions." 

Executive Order No. 49, it 
was pointed out, settles the 



question of whether deposits 
made in local banks during 
the enemy occupation are 
null or valid. It was explain- 
ed that when President Os- 
mena landed in , Leyte, he 
made clear that Japanese 
money would not be recog- 
nized as legal tender and that 
as a consequence deposits 
made have been declared 
void. On the other hand, 
withdrawals made during the 
period of enemy occupation 
are held valid.

Thirty-seventh Division troops advanced nearly

Nueva Vizcaya, and pushing three miles farther down 
the Santa Fe river in the headwaters of the' Cagayan

ance and seized large quantities of food and medical 
supplies.

OKINAWA — Ameri- 
can 10th Army troops, in 
a general advance Wed- 
nesday along all sectors 
of the Okinawa battle- 
front, completed the cap- 
ture of Naha airfield, 
largest airdrome in the 
Ryukyus, and d rove 
wedges deep into the 
southern end of the island, 
yesterday's Pacific Fleet 
communique announced. 

The Naha airdrome with its 
three long air strips is the most 
prized airfield in the RyukyUE 
and the last of five airfields on 
Okinawa that were originally 
in Japanese hands. . 

Wednesday's sweeping gains 
compressed the remaining Jap- 
anese into an area of about 25 
square miles in the southern 
end of Okinawa. They were 
making a new stand in tfcti ' 
Vaeju-Dake escarpment. This 
arc-like elevation, stretches in 
a semi-circle across the south- 
ern end of the island from 
Hamagusuku on the east cosst 
to Itoman on the west ccucnu 

Marines of the Sixth Division 
captured the Naha Air field 
after reducing resistance from 
numerous strong points and for- 
tified caves on the field on Wed- 
nesday. They had already ex- 
panded the division's area of 
control on the Oroku penirsiila 
and started driving eastward 
for a junction with the First 
Marine Division in the center 
of the island. 

After sweeping over mj! c£ 
the Chinen peninsula, the 24th 
Army Corps turned its main 
weight westward toward the 
Vaeju-Dake escarpment. The 
First Division Marines in the 
center of the island also were 
driving directly south toward 
the escarpment.

planes again attacked shipping 
off Okinawa, damaging two 
surface units during which ftoe 
enemy planes were shot down.

AN EVENTFUL ANNIVERSARY 

Two days ago in Europe marked a significant anniversary in 
ihe annals of military history. In the early morning hours of 
last June 6, the United States Army, operating across 3,000 miles 
of ocean from its arsenals, factories, and training camps, landtd 
on the Normandy coast of France. It was the greatest amphi- 
bious movement in history. 

The landing was completed successfully against an enemy 
which had four years to prepare its defenses, on a section of 
coastline regarded as the most heavily fortified in the world. 
Less than eleven months later, Germany capitulated, her entire 
country laid waste. 

The implication should be obvious to Japan. The United 
States was able to inflict its armed will on Germany across 
3,000 miles of sub-ridden waters, even while massing tools, mta 
and ships in the Pacific to carry American forces back to the 
Philippines, to Japan's front porch. 

Now, there is only one enemy. And American will, as 
expressed by President Truman — "to win the war in Japan, to 
win it completely, and to win it as quickly as possible" — shall be 
inflicted against the one remaining enemy at a none too distant 
date, more effectively, and even more powerfully than on the 
beaches of Normandy. 



Bretton Woods 
Approval Seen 

WASHINGTON — House 
Minority leader Joseph W. 
Martin yesterday predicted that

the Bretton Woods monetary 
agreements. 

Emerging from a special con- 
ference of the House Repub- 
lican members who met to dis- 
cuss the bill, Martin said: 
' There will be no party fight 
on this legislation." 

However, there were indica- 
tions that a block of Repub- 
lican representatives would 
0 >pose the bill. 

The Bretton Woods monetary 
agreements, drawn up last sum- 
mer by representatives of , 44 
nations, call for $9,100,000,000 
to make reconstruction and 
development loans and an $8,- 
800,000,000 international fund 
for stabilization of currencies.

DETROIT, MICH. — Gen. 
Carl A. Spaatz, commander

that American air power 
would sweep Japanese sui-

telligence," behind superior 
equipment, to reduce "hyste- 
rical members" of the Jap-

ation in history."

security," adding that she is

Educator Opposes 
Peacetime Draft 

WASHINGTON— A, J, Brim- 
baugh, Vice President of the 
American Council on Educa- 
tion, yesterday cautioned 
against "regimentation of the 
mind" which he said would 
result from a peacetime draft law. 

Brunbaugh, spokesman for a 
large segment of American edu- 
cation and first of opposition 
group witnesses to be heard by 
the House post-war military

4-Power Council Adjourns 
Until Zones Are Occupied 

BERLIN — The Allied Control Commission for Germany ^Vl^mmisSo^ 1 af 
yesterday signed the four-powered declaration estab]ishmg the <r^ m ^J be 
She Reich's governing body and then agreed that no further meetings would De 
Eld until the combined occupation forces have established themselves in the 

~ — — - — ^occupation zones. 

The brief 20 -minute meeting 
was attended by General 
Eisenhower, Kussian Marshal 
Zhukov, British Field Marshal 
Bernard Montgomery and

in the newly built Russian om- 
eers' Club outside of Koepenick

meeting said: "On behalf of 
the Soviet government, I wel- 
come you on coming here to 
sign the four-power declara 
lion, I propose to begin our 
work by signing the text." 

Zhukov then explained there 
was a deviation in article ten 
of the Russian text in which 
the word "cargoes" was - used, 
whereas in the English- and 
French text the word read 
"nationals." It was agreed to 
eliminate this word until "fur- 
ther clarifications*"

been held up six hours in at- 
tempts to "clarify" the word 
while Zhukov conferred with 
members of the British, United 
States and French delegation.

the Allied ^ representatives to 
the remainder of the text and

with which he had signed Ger- 
many's unconditional surrender 
document on May 8th. 

Following ihe brief ceremony, 
the delegation heads gathered 
on the front porch of the build- 
ing for private talks. 

It was during these conver- 
sations that it was agreed there 
would not be another meeting 
of the control commission until 
the Allied forces had entered 
their Gorman occupation zones, 
Eisenhower and Mpntgomery 
left Berlin again, the American 
general returning to his 
advanced headquarters at

A small force of Seventh Air Force Liberators at- 
tacked the airfield at Miho on the south coast of Honshu 
with 1,000-pound bombs, cratering runways and de- 
stroying buildings. Another Liberator struck at Tanega 
in the Sumi island group off Kyushu, to the south. 

Seventh Air Force Liberators also bombed Tinghai

while others strafed barges, docks, and warehouses at 
three points on the Indo-China coast.

Allies Hold Benito's 
| Son in Internment Camp 

LONDON — Vittoro Mussolini, 
son of the former Italian dicta- 
tor, is in an internment camp 
under Anglo-American super- 
vision, a dispatch from the 
Italian-Swiss frontier said yes- 
terday. 

Vittoro had been "found" by 
Allied troops, the report ex- 
plained 



The Senate at its special ses- 
sion passed a bill calling for 
elections to be held on Novem- 
ber 13, but the house tabled 
further action on it. 

Answering a direct question, 
the President asserted all Fili- 
pino officials who served in the 
puppet Republic forfeited their 
right to continue in office. 

This statement has a direct 
bearing on the President's re- 
fusal to reappoint to the judi- 
ciary all those who served 
under the Japs without distinc- 
tion. ' , 

President Osmena said he 
was in favor of a liberal policy 
and intended to return to of- 
fice all except those found to 
have collaborated with the 
enemy. However, in case of 
the judiciary he had been care- 
ful to see to it that no act of 
his tended to shake the confi- 
dence of the people. 

The President said he had 
reappointed three justices of 
the supreme court who served 
during the puppet regime. The 
eight other men he named to 



1,000 US. and British Carrier 
Planes Again Over Inland Sea 

GUAM — Over 1,000 American arid British car- 
rier planes launched new attacks on Japan's Inland 
Sea yesterday after damaging seven warships in 
Tuesday's dawn to dusk assaults, vPacific Fleet head- 
quarters announced last night. 

In action which Admiral William F. Halsey, 
commander of the U. S. Third Fleet, described as 
the "first plunge into the heart of the Japanese 
empire," Allied planes damaged two 30,000-ton 
battleships — the Ise and Hyuga — along with two 
heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, one large -aircraft 
carrier and one escort carrier. J 
Damage to Japan's dwindling fleet was an- 
nounced in the first Navy communique yesterday, 
followed by a special bulletin one hour later, disclos- 
ing carrier attacks against Japanese homeland targets 
were continuing into their second consecutive "day 

<♦> £ . 

Between the 48 hours of 
concentrated carrier assaults, 
Rear Admiral J. C. Jones took 
a small force of cruisers and 
destroyers to the southwest- 
ern tip of Honshu to bombard 
Kushimoto seaplane base and 
an airfield, radio station and 
other targets in the vicinity 
of Kushimoto. Steaming into 
attack during dawn yester- 
day, they encountered and 
sank one small ship. 

Yesterday's targets were 
identified only as "major com- 
batant ships and other military" 
targets along the Inland Sea 
from Kobe, 150 miles westward 
to Kure. 

This meant that Halsey's 
Third Fleet, accompanied by a 
fast carrier task force of the 
British Pacific Fleet, were car- 
rying their far-ranging sea and 
air assaults against Japan into 
the sixteenth day. In that pe- 
riod, ships, guns, carrier planes 
and land-based aircraft of the 
Pacific Fleet command had 
sunk or damaged 563 enemy 
ships and small craft and de- 
stroyed or damaged 635 planes. 

With reports from Admiral 
Halsey covering less than half 
of Tuesday's action by more 
than 1,000 planes, Pacific Fleet 
headquarters said that in ad- 
dition to two battleships dam- 
aged, the heavy cruiser Tone, 
14,000 tons, was left burning 
badly; the heavy cruiser Aoba, 
9,000 tons, was damaged; and 
the light cruiser Oyoda, 6,000 
tons, was left burning badly. 
Of the two damaged carriers, 
the large one was unidentified, 
but the escort carrier was of 
the "Kobe" class. 

American carrier planes dam- 
aged all except the escort car- 
rier which British flyers picked 
off in the Inland Sea north of 
Takamatsu on Shikoku. 

The British also damaged 
two freighters off the Shikoku 
coast and sank one small coast- 
al cargo vessel, three luggers 

(Continued on page 4) 



the supreme court did not serve 
under the Japs. The reason 
for that, Osmena said, was he 
did not want the supreme 
court to have a majority of 
members who were identified 
with the past regime because 
they may have to pass on ques- 
tions involving collaboration 
with the enemy. 



Sugar Crop Shrinks 

WASHINGTON — As a result

AN UNtXPtClhD LEGACY 

To war devastated Manila and the Philippines, the tremen- 
dous physical miracle performed by the Army in putting these 
islands back on their feet, as a happy incidental to the role they 
are designed to play in the defeat of Japan, comes as an 
unexpected legacy. 

The boss of U.S. Army Service forces in the Western Pa- 
cific, Lt. Gen. W. D. Styer on Tuesday gave the public a brief 
glimpse of what already has been done. He revealed the Army 
had set the wheels whirring in two local cement plants, was 
equipping lumber mills, and planned to help rehabilitate hemp, 
copra, cordage, edible oils, and soap industries in the islands. 

In some cases, the Army has provided labor and equipment 
to restore damaged factories, and has contracted to buy their 
entire output. The Army figures key items produced here save 
time and valuable shipping space. Simultaneously, 



double 



purpose is served by restoring the Philippines 1 ability to produce. 

Much of the work wffl pay dividends to these needy islands 
for years to come. Manila's harbor, for instance, through in- 
genuity, labor, money and equipment of American engineers, 
already has been repaired and expanded to nearly double its 
peacetime capacity. At present 26 ships can berth here simul- 
taneously. New rail lines connect North Harbor, and will be 
extended to South Harbor. 

In the peace years to come, Manila, thanks to American 
engineers, will be in better physical condition than any other 
port in the western Pacific to handle the flow of consumer goods 
which will stream from the United States to waiting markets in 
the Far East. : __ __ _____

In Science Sought 

WASHINGTON— A bill pro- 
viding for establishment of a 
national foundation to promote 
and develop scientific research 
was introduced yesterday by 
Sen. Harley M. Kilgore of West 
Virginia. 

The bill, which would also 
coordinate federal scientific 
activity, would pave the way 
"for the United States to be- 
come the pre-eminent scientific 
nation in the world and no long- 
er dependent on or subordinated 
to German scientific leadership, 
as we were at the outset of the 
war," Kilgore said. 

Sens. Claude Pepper of Flo- 
rida and Edwin Johnson of 
Colorado also issued statements 
supporting the bill. They point- 
ed to the need for support and 
encouragement of intensive re- 
search in all fields of science in

pine provincial capital to be lib- 
erated by the American forces, 
has become the trade center of 
the Visayan Islands and Minda- 
nao, according to Mamerto 
Corre, a lieutenant in the U. S. 
Army who came to Manila last 
Monday. Sailboats loaded with 
foodstuffs and all sorts of com- 
modities from different sections 
of the Visayas and Mindanao 
anchor at the Tacloban port 
almost every day. Trade has 
boomed because of the influx of 
businessmen from other prov- 
inces. 

As a direct consequence, 
prices of things in Tacloban have 
skyrocketed, Corre pointed out. 
A ganta of rice sells at from 
P3 to F4 and chicken eggs cost 
PI apiece. Housing has become 
a serious problem. The addi- 
tional population from the other 
Visayan and Mindanao prov- 
inces has resulted in exorbitant 
house rentals.

Life-Risking Practical Joke by Dutch 
Thwarts German Steal of Tulip Industry 

- _ _ 4,,r n „A *1 Ui 4.1. t . 



NEW YORK — How a life 
risking practical joke on the 
Nazis is now aiding the re- 
covery of Holland's famed 
tulip industry was disclosed 
Monday by the N.Y. Herald 
Tribune, quoting H. K. Mans- 
field, treasurer of American 
relief for Holland. > 

The Nazis, during their oc- 
cupation of Holland, planned 
to take over the tulip indus- 



try and thought they had 
succeeded. 

Scarcely had they intro- 
duced their gauleiters, when 
orders were issued to convert 
bulb-growing areas into 
mine-fields, anti-tank ditch- 
es, pillboxes and other re- 
placements. 

Believing soil thus exca- 
vated contained elements es- 
sential to best development 
of the famed Dutch tulips and 



hyacinths, the Nazis seized 
tons upon tons of this soil 
and transported it to German 
areas where the bulb-grow- 
ing business was to be in- 
troduced. 

The Nazis then arranged 
for shipment to Germany of 
the most rare and most 

prized of Holland bulbs 

each a product of nearly 400 
years of Dutch care, culture 
and development. 



How ever, between issuance 
of orders and shipment of 
bulbs, wily Dutch growers, 
each risking death or a con- 
centration camp, substituted 
secondary and common types 
of bulbs for those selected by 
the Nazis. 

Dutch gro we -s retained,

an their most treasured stock, 
as well as new varieties

ROME— Forty-eight hours of 
noting, fighting and destruc-

Keg-ina Coeli prison subsided 
yesterday after one man was 
killed and eleven hurt by bul- 
lets and collapse of a blazing 
roof. 

The tragedy began when 
2,400 criminals and political 
prisoners, jammed into a prison 
built for 800, overpowered 
guards and threatened to burst 
out. Hundreds of police and 
file brigades, two armored cars, 
and tank surrounded the prison 
maintaining .order among; a mob 
of relatives of inmates who 
gathered outside the walls.

"Butcher of Lidice" Goes 
On Trial September 7 

MONDORF, LUXEMBOURG — Hermann Frank, 
"Butcher of Lidice" arid former protector for Bohemia 
and Moravia, will go on trial in Prague about September 
1, Dr. Boguslav Ecer, Czechoslovak representative of 
the United Nations War Crimes Commission, declared 
Tuesday. 

Regardless of the outcome of the trial, Frank will 
be turned over to the commission for re4rial on other 
charges, Ecer disclosed. Frank will be indicted in 
Prague with 26 other German officials. 

Frank, if convicted and sen-< 
tenced to death, either in 
Czechoslovakia or by the United 



Nations, will be sent to Checho- 
slovakia for execution because 
of crimes committed on that 
country's soil. 

Indictments against Prank 
will cite the crime of prepar- 
ing for and launching a war 
which automatically included 
all members of the German gov- 
ernment, and crimes committed 
because of religious, racial, or 
political policies. 

Ecer expressed the hope that 
"press representatives from all 
the nations" would be present 
at the trials "so that precise 
legal findings and all facts of 
the trial will be made known to 
every citizen of the world, and 
especially to every German."

ton while on his tour of the Pacific, it was announced 
resterday at Gen. MacArttiur's headquarters. 

The conference of the former commander of U. S. 
irmy forces in China and Burma with Gen. MacArthur 
robably concerned ground force requirements to meet

Fpe of troops required for Pacific fighting and kindred 
Ejects.

2 Central American 
Nations to Merge 

MEXICO CITY— The union 
of Guatemala and El Salvador 
will take place within three or 
four months and the birth of 
the new federal republic of 
Central America will be an- 
nounced, the Guatemalan 
charge d'affaires said yesterday 

He said the presidents of 
Guatemala and El Salvador 
agreed to resign in order to 
facilitate the union. 



Cagayan Drive 

The 37th Division driv- 
ing north along the Caga- 
yan valley road in north- 
ern Luzon secured the 
town of Bayombong 
Thursday in an advance 
of seven miles. Japanese 
opposition was slight, and 
today's communique from 
Gen. MacArthur reported 
the destruction of two 
enemy flame-throwing 
tanks and the capture of 
a number of vehicles. In 
their advance, the Ameri- 
cans crossed to the east bank 
of the Santa Fe river, which at 
Bayombong changes to the 
Magat river. 

In the Marikina sector, 
American forces advanced up 
to two miles in flanking move' 
ments around Japanese moun 
tain defenses. Fifth Air Force 
flyers dropped 320 tons of 
bombs in close support of Luzon 
ground operations. One Ameri- 
can plane was lost. 

Pushing ahead at several 
points in- southern Mindanao, 
the American troops made 
general advance up the Talomo 
river and took the highway 
junction of Ula. Dive bombers 
hit an enemy transport and 
touched off an explosion in a 
supply area north of Cape San 
Agustin. 

Thirteenth Air Force heavy 
and medium bombers and fight 
ers started many fires in drop 
ping i70 tons of bombs Wed- 
nesday on airfields and supply 
bases in Borneo. Light naval 
units shelled beach defenses 
along the northern coast. Night 
bombers started fires Wednes- 
day in Taihoku on Formosa. 
Elockade planes destroyed a 
coastal vessel east of Foochow, 
a large junk off southern 
Hainan island and bombed the 
Canton area. ' 




Gen. George S. Patton 

PATTON BACK 

Boston — Gen. George S. 
Patton, Jr., commander of the 
U. S. Third Army, which made 
history in the defeat of Nazi 
Gerrhany, came back to his

yesterday, arriving in the after- 
noon by ulane from Paris. 

A roaring welcome including 
a parade, a public reception and 
a state dinner was Handed the 
famou s general. m 

Climax of Okinawa 
Fighting Is Near 

GUAM — The First Marines 
yesterday captured Hill 108 
west of Dakitan on Okinawa as 
they pushed to the west coast 
for a junction with a Division 
of the Sixth Marines, Pacific 
Fleet headquarters announced 

Maj. Gen. Roy Geiger, com- 
mander of the Marine's Third 
Amphibious Corps, declared the 
major part of the Okinawa 
campaign may be ended within 
less than a week, although 
fighting will undoubtedly con- 
tinue after that period. 



Star Witness in Pasay 
Slayings Is Kidnaped 



Gregorio Santerb, alias 
Goring, principal star witness 
in the double murder case 
bow pending trial in the 
Manila court of first instance, 
in which the assistant mayor 
of Pasay and four of his spe- 
cial agents and six policemen 
of the said district are charg- 
ed, was kidnaped at Pasay on 



June 5 at about 7:30 in the 
evening. 

The act of kidnaping a 
late witness is an open chal- 
lenge to the newly organized 
commonwealth of the Philip- 
Pines and to the Umted. 
States Army, CoL^ "JJ 
bud, provost marsn** 



chief of police stated yester- 
day. 

Col. Holland requested 
public cooperation with 
authorities in securing neces- 
sary information leading to 
the identification and arrest 
of the kidnapers and the loca- 
tion and whereabouts of the 
said state witness. 



At 4 O'clock 

Economic rather than 
political considerations 
appear to be uppermost in 
the mind of the average 
Filipino as he awaits the 
opening session of the 
Philippine congress at 4 
o'clock this afternoon. 

This win be the first free 
meeting of the bicameral legis- 
lature since its election in 1941, * 
a month prior to the Japanese 
invasion. It will be held at the 
former Japanese elementary 
school on Lepanto, temporary 
headquarters of the house of 
representatives. 

President Sergio Osmeria 
will address the lawmakers 
as soon as the session opens. 
Public interest in the speech 
is heightened by the fact it 
will be the first official report 
on the state of the nation by 
the Commonwealth President, 
who is serving the second half 
of the four-year term of the 
late President Quezon. 
Quezon and Osmena (then 
vice president) took their oaths 
under the shadow of Corregi- 
dor's guns in December, 1941. 
General of the Army Douglas 
MacArthur administered the 
oaths. - 

This wiU be the smaUest 
group of lawmakers ever as- 
sembled in the Philippines since 
creation of a bicameral legis- 
lature in 1916. 

Ranks of the lawmaking body 
have been seriously depleted. 
Death at the hands of the Jap- 
anese, death from natural 
causes, prison bars, and the fact 
some still were in regions oc- 
cupied by the enemy, combin- 
ed to bring down the number 
available. 

The senate, especially, was 
particularly hit. Seven sen- 
ators are imprisoned, await- 
ing trial on charges of colla- 
boration: Jose Yulo, Quintin 
Paredes, Claro M. Recto, An- 
tonio de las Alas, Emiliano 
Tria Tirona, Proceso Sebas- 
tian and Vicente Madrigal, 
Murdered by the Japs at 
Fort Santiago was Jose Oza- 
mis, Daniel Maramba, an- 
other senator, died soon after 
election. 

Extraordinary efforts were 
made to bring the total number 
of senators up to the necessary 
quorum. Sen. Carlos P. Garcia, 
recalled from the San Francisco 
Conference, arrived by plane 
several days ago. There are 
now 13 senators available for 
the first meeting, out of a total 
of 24. They are Manuel Roxas, 
Melecio Arranz, Elpidio Quiri- 
no, Nicolas Buendia, Eulogio 
Rodriguez, Sr., Esteban de la 
Rama, Domingo Imperial, Ra-

WASHINGTON — U. S. 
Associate Supreme Court 
Justice Robert H. Jackson, 
U. S. prosecutor of war 
criminals, recommended 
yesterday in his first re- 
port to President Truman 
that sure justice should be 
meted out to the German 
General Staff, every top 
Nazi leader, the Gestapo 
and the S.S. Corps. 

He said: "We propose to 
punish acts which have been 
regarded as criminal since the 
time of Cain and have been 
written in every civilized code." 

Jackson's report reviewed at 
length the U. S. position on the 
trials of war criminals, discuss- 
ed the many problems relating 
to the trials, and made clear 
the determination of this coun- 
try to bring to justice those 
criminal members of "a band 
of brigands who had seized the 
instrumentality of a state." 

Stating the United States 
position in bringing war crim- 
inals to justice, Jackson said: 
"We will accuse a large num- 
ber of individuals and officials 
who were in authority in the 
government, in the military 
establishment, including the 
German General Staff and in 
the financial, industrial and 
economic life of Germany who, 
by all civilized standards are 
probable to become common 
criminals. 

"We also propose to estab 
lish the criminal character of 
several voluntary organizations 
which have played a cruel and 
controlling part in subjugating 
Germans and their neighbors." 
Jackson said that the U. S. 
concerned with the Nazi

Jap Captives 
Change Tune 

IN NORTHERN LUZON 
-Most Japs, when cap- 
tured, expect to be tortur- 
ed and killed. Then, when 
they find they are treated 
humanly, they decide that 
being a captive is a good 
break after all. 

Authority for these 
statements is Pfc. J. Carl- 
ton Hoover of Williams- 
Port, Pa. He spends most 
of his time guarding pris- 
ts and watching their 
viewpoint change. 

(( Most Jap prisoners beg 
t0 be killed when we first 
set them," Hoover said. 

Often they go into hys- 
le ;ics. One who begged all 
? Ight to be killed was go- 
^ around the next day,

Columbia, Missouri — The 
future destiny of the United 
States lies in the Pacific and 
other countries of the Orient, 
John B. Powell, former editor 
of the China Weekly Review who 
lost both feet in a Japanese 
prison camp, declared here 
yesterday. ' 

Powell, speaking at commence- 
ment exercises of the University 
of Missouri, said: "Turning of 
the tide of war from the 
Atlantic to the Pacific has com- 
pelled us to concentrate our 
attention upon the section of the 
earth's surface which heretofore 
has been a closed book to 
Americans." 

Citing that these regions are 
likely to "exert a profound 
influence" upon the future of the 
U. S., Powell added: 

"Three countries of the Orient 
will make heavy demands upon 
the United States after the war. 
They are China, Russian 
Siberia and British India. 

"Tens of millions of intelli- 
gent Asiatic leaders in every 
Far Eastern country will, in the 
future, center their attention on 
the democratic power which was 
:, chiefly v responsible for the 
in the military victories j n b 0 th Europe and 

~ Asia."

President Sergio Osmena ap-

the Pl,168,000, one million pesos 
has been set aside for the main- 
tenance and repair of national 
roads and bridges; P135,000 for 
maintenance and operation of 
irrigation systems; P15,000 for 
the Pampanga River Control; 
and P18,000 for the maintenance

He emphasized that it was

authentic and should constitute 
a well documented history of 
what we are convinced was a 
grand pattern to incite and 
commit aggressions and barba- 
rities which have shocked the 
world. 

There are two kinds of often 
ders who will not come under 
the jurisdiction of Jackson. 
Firstly, are offenders against 
U S. military personnel now 
under military jurisdiction 
Secondly, are offenders who are 
to be sent back to the scene of 
their crimes for local trial ac- 
cording to the Moscow declara-

SPAIN GIVEN NOTICE 

MADRID— The United States 
embassy has called the Spanish 
government's attention to the

handed over to the Allied

Big Nations Agree on Steps 
To Isolate New Aggression 



SAN FRANCISCO, CALIF.— 
Agreement was reported reach- 
ed here Wednesday among rep- 
resentatives of the United 
States, the United Kingdom, the 
Soviet Union, France and China 
on the manner in which region- 
al treaties against enemy states 
may in the future- be merged 
with operations of the new 
world organization. 

Earlier, France had objected 
to a proposal by the other four 
nations— conference sponsors— 
that would have given the 
world organization the lnitia- 
tiveiri determining when it was 
in a position to assume respon- 
sibilities of preventing renewed 
aggression by enemy states. 
France was understood to pre- 
fer a* provision that would per- 
mit signatories to treaties to 
take the initiative in turning 
over responsibilities to tne 
organization. , 
The original provision as put 
forward by the four sponsoring 
nations, stated that action may 
be taken on a basis of "regional 



arrangements directed against 
the renewal of aggressive policy 
on part of such (enemy) states 
until such time as the organiza- 
tion may by the consent of 
governments concerned be 
charged with the respon- 
sibility ... " . 

France reportedly wanted 
that statement revised so that 
rather more than calling for 
"consent" of governments con- 
cerned the turning over of re- 
sponsibility would be at the 
"request" of those governments. 

No announcement was made 
of the nature of the agreement 
reached by the five nations on 
this matter but the French 
delegate was said to be "entire 
ly satisfied" with it.

Churchill Says 
No Secret Pact 
Made at Yalta 

LONDON — Prime Minister 
Churchill told the House of 
Commons yesterday that no 
secret agreements were reached 
at Yalta that had not already 
been made public. 

He explained that the Soviet 
request for seats at San Fran- 
cisco for. the Ukrainian and 
Byelo-Russian republics, and the 
British-American decision to 
support the request was kept 
secret until the late President 
Roosevelt could return to the 
U.S. and make the necessary 
arrangements. 

Churchill added that "Convex 
sations, of course, proceeded in 
an intimate manner and I am 
not prepared to say that every- 
thing discussed at Yalta could 
be made the subject of a report," 
he added.

HOUSE BY THUMPING 




ft'// A/fWes (y.S. Stare 
In World Stabilization Fund 

WASHINGTON — The House of Representatives 
yesterday gave President Truman's world coopera- 
tion program a thumping vote of confidence, passing 
by a vote of 345 to 18 a bill authorizing United States 
membership in two international monetary institutions 
S" Dted at B«*ton Woods, New Hampshire, last 

The measure was sent to the Senate, where the 
Banking and Currency com mittee will be^in hearings 

^on it shortly. The opposition 
predicted a vigorous fight. 

The bill would authorize the 
United States to participate in 
the proposed $9,100,000,000 
international bank and the 
$8,800,000,000 s t a b i 1 i z ation 
fund. The bank would make 
loans for reconstruction and 
development o f devastated 
countries, while the fund would 
be used to prevent fluctuations 
in exchange rates. 

Yesterday's action by the 
House makes the United States 
the first of the United Nations 
to act on the Bretton Woods 
agreements which have been 
described as laying the econo- 
mic foundation for a lasting 
peace. 

♦u Du £ ng y ester day's debate on 
the bill, a proposal which 
would, in effect, have scrapped 
the stabilization fund and per- 

mi lu d 5 e U ' S -' s Participation 
in the bank alone, was defeat 
ed by a vote of 325 to 29 

^l mn ^^ g on the Passage 
of the bill by the House, Sec- 
retary of the Treasury, Henry 
Morgenthau, Jr., said that the 
House had "spoken forcefully 
for the principle of internation- 
al cooperation," adding, "The 
action will engender a feeling 
of great confidence throughout 
the world at a time when it is 
important that we concentrate 
oui efforts upon the achieve- 
ment of world security and 
peace. 

"The American people and 
W^Ol the world wiU wel- 
come this evidence of states 
manship in world affairs 

ft presages an era of world 
cooperation which will lead to 
prosperity for all."

States stand behind that pledg^ ?** 
na Jf C , shall 1 k fP tnis promise just 
as we have kept every promise which 
America has made to the Filipino 
people. 

Soon after, on the initiative of Presi- 
dent Quezon, steps were taken to ob- 
tain congressional sanction for these 
Pledges. If this is all that President 
Quezon had achieved in his political 
career— and his political record can 
hardly be surpassed— it alone would 
entitle him to the eternal gratitude of 
his people. Senate Joint Resolution 
No. 93, which President Quezon and I 
asked for and accepted, is the culmi- 
nation of our joint congressional ef- 
forts. This legislation authorizes the 
President of the United States to ad- 
vance the date of independence provided 
in the independence law. It also pro- 
vides, through the maintenance by the 
United States of bases ^in the Philip- 
pines, "for full security for the Phil- 
ippines, for the mutual protection of 




President Sergio Osmena 

the Islands and the United States, and 
for the future maintenance of peace in 
the Pacific.'' 

So that the import of this new legis- 
lation, and the responsibility which 
we Filipinos have assumed thereby, may 
be better understood, it is necessary 
that we review past events even if we 
have to walk again on well-trodden 
paths. 

National independence was the goal 
which our revolutionaries of 1896 and 
1898 set for themselves. When the 
fortunes of war were adverse to our 
arms and American sovereignty was 
established in 1898, individual liberties 
were recognized, among them the right 
of free assembly. Under the protec- 
tion of this freedom, two political 
groups came into existence: the Fede- 
ralists, who declared themselves in 
favor of the annexation 'of the Phil- 
ippines to the United States so as to 
constitute, in due time, a state of the 
union; and the Nacionalistas, who ad 
vocated the ideal of independence which 
the Filipino revolutionaries had pro- 
claimed but were not able to achieve 
in war. , , 

This aspiration to be free, nurtured 
in an atmosphere of peace, was received 
with sympathy in the United States. 
The legitimacy of this aspiration was 
recognized by Dr. Jacob C. Schurman 
President of the first American com 
mission sent by President McKmley to 
the Philippines in these memorable 

words: " * 

"The watchword of progress, the 
key to the future of the political dev- 
elopment of the archipelago, fit neither 
colonialism nor federalism, but na- 
tionalism. The destiny of the Phil- 
imoine Islands is not to be a state or 
Story in the United States of 
Amertca, but a daughter republic of 
oure-a new birth of liberty on the 
other side of the Pacific, which shall 
animate and energize tho^ lovely 
islands of the tropical seas, and, rear- 



ing its head aloft, stand as a monu 
nient of progress and a beacon of 
hope to all the oppressed and be- 
nighted millions of the Asiatic con- 
tinent." 

On their part the Filipino people, 
who had 1 elected a majority of Naciona- 
istas to the first Philippine Assembly, 
which met in 1907, repeatedly reiterated 
their confidence in them in successive 
elections, until the Congress approved 
in 1934 the Tydings-McDuffie act creat- 
ing the present Commonwealth. This 
law was accepted, first by the Legis- 
lature and then directly by the people, 
thus binding America and the Philip- 
pines to a virtual covenant by which 
the United States formally com- 
mitted itself to withdraw its sovereignty 
from the Philippines and proclaim our 
independence on July 4, 1546. The 
ten-year transition period was not 
established to delay the proclamation 
of independence, but only to prepare 
the Philippines adequately for the re- 
sponsibilities of nationhood. 

We were well advanced in our pre- 
parations for independence when we 
became the object of an unjust ag- 
gression by Japan. v But the military 
occupation of the Philippines by Japan 
had not affected the independence 
program agreed upon between the 
United States and the Philippines. 
When President Roosevelt invited the 
President of the government of the 
Commonwealth and his cabinet to 
evacuate to the United States, he did 
not do so merely to preserve the con- 
stitutional integrity of the Philippine 
Government but also to assure the 
realization, in due time, of the program 
of independence. 

With this fundamental idea in mind, 
the United States took the initiative 
of considering the Philippines as po3 
sessing all of the attributes of com 
plete and respected nationhood. I 
cannot give you a more authoritative 
statement concerning the status of our 
government in Washington than that 
which President Roosevelt himself 
made in his broadcast to the Philip- 
pines on August 13, 1943 : 

"The Philippine Government is a 
signatory of the Declaration by the 
United Nations, along with 31 other 
nations. President Quezon and Vice 
President Osmena attend the meet- 
ings of the Pacific War Council, 
where the war in the Pacific is 
charted and planned. Your gov- 
ernment has participated fully and 
equally in the United Nations con- 
ference on food and agriculture, and 
a Philippine representative is a mem- 
ber of the interim commission created 
by that conference. And, of course, 
the Philippine government will have 
its rightful place in the conference 
which will follow the defeat of 
Japan." 

In confirmation of this status we are 
now participating, among the free 
and independent nations of the world, 
in the United Nations Conference on 
International Organization now taking 
place in San Francisco. 

This war, which has ravaged the 
world and which is yet to be won in the 
Pacific, has brought to the Philippines 
a permanent blessing. I refer to the 
fundamental change in America s policy 
with regard to the outside world, 
namely, her abandonment of tne at- 
titude of isolation and. her frank 
acknowledgment of her duty, as one 
of the most powerful nations on earth, 
to preserve for all mankind liberty, 
justice, peace and security.

asserted ideology. Congress ajP" v ~ ™

tially written with the blood of the 
heroes and martyrs of our history, 
which took root in the days of the 
first Philippine Assembly in 1907, 
which acquired consistency throughout 
the long period of Filipino-American 
collaboration resulting in the approval 
of the Jones law in 1916 and the es- 
tablishment of the Commonwealth in 
1935, is a program definitely accepted 
by the Filipino people. Those of us 
who are temporarily in charge of the 
affairs of state are mere trustees of 
the sacred ideal of our people. We have 
no right to turn back — we shall not 
turn back — neither cowed by imaginary 
dangers or swayed by the sheer greed 
of living a life of ease and plenty. 
We cannot sell our liberty for a mass 
f pottage. S . 

When Andres Bonifacio and his men 
uttered their now historic First Cry of 
Balintawak, they were not held back 
by fear of the enemy, or by any love of 
earthly goods. When we took over the 
banner of liberty from those that fell 
in the night of our defeat, we asked 
only for freedom and for nothing more. 
When we were asked in 1934 if we 
preferred liberty to prosperity, our 
people answered overwhelmingly that 
they desired liberty above everything 
else. Now that the United States, in 
recognition of our role in this war, has 
declared itself our ally and, with 
liberty, offers us security, it is our duty 
and our choice to accept. 

So I say to every Filipino and to all 
other elements in our states, that the 
die is cast. Our course is straight and 
inflexible. We are going forward to 
the achievement of our national as- 
piration. 

Gentlemen of the Congress: You 
are gathered today under the most try- 
ing circumstances. There are many 
serious problems ahead of us. But we 
who have so long and ardently clamored 
for self-government must prove to the 
world that we are equal to the most 
exacting tasks of public administra- 
tion. That great and distinguished 
friend of the Filipino people. General 
of the Army Douglas MacArthur, once 
said that they are only fit to live who 
are not afraid to die. Our people have 
shown on the battlefield that they are 
not afraid to die. But the tasks of 
peace are at times more exacting than 
those of war. We are administering the 
affairs of 18,000,000 people just de- 
livered from three long years of en- 
slavement. To them we owe justice, 
order and the means to live in con- 
tentment and happiness. I am aware 
that our means at the moment are 
inadequate. We are not able to pro- 
vide our people with as much as they 
deserve. But, we shall not falter in 
the line of duty. Let us get together 
in one mighty effort. Let us set aside 
selfish considerations and forget petty 
differences. Only in unity can there 
be strength. To the experienced, I 
turn for advice. From the youth of 
the land, I ask for its enthusiasm and 
energies. My faith in our people is 
unbounded. Over the rtflns of our 
citie3 and barrios we shall build anew. 
In this most crucial hour of our his- 
tory, I look forward to our destiny 
unafraid, confident that, God willing, 
ours will be a happy, progressive and 
prosperous land. 

In closing, permit me to congratulate 
you most heartily for being the first 
elective Congress to meet in a country 
liberated from the enemy, although the 
Philippines is among the la3t to be 
free from enemy occupation and con- 
trol. I wish you all success in dis- 
charging the tremendous responsibility 
that is youra during the present 
emergency. 



Tigercat Plane 
Waits Chance 

Beth Page, N. Y. — A new 
Navy fighter plane, a twin- 
engined Grumann P-TF Tiger- 
cat, the swiftest and most 
powerful yet built for the 
American fleet, is ready for ac- 
tion against the Japs, it wai 
disclosed Friday. 

The Navy removed some of 
the secrecy surrounding the 
new heavy, high-speed fighter, 
which it described as one of tha 
answers to improved perform- 
ances by Japanese aircraft. 

Although the number and 
size of guns carried were not 
revealed, the Navy said that it3 
full fire-power could smash a 
big Jap bomber in a single 
burst. 

Some highlights of the Tiger- 
cat are: Ability to climb steeply 
at better than a mile a minute; 
ability to carry a 4,000-pound 
bomb load of full size torpedoes 
and rockets; a longer range 
than any previous fighter. 

The first Tigercats will bo 
used by Marine pilots for land- 
based operations. The Navy 
said its own fliers would use the 
plane on a new 45,000-ton 
carrier of the Midway class. 



TO TRUCK CATTLE 

The Emergency Control Ad- 
ministration has assigned four 
trucks to the Philippine Cattle 
Dealers' Cooperative Associa- 
tion for transportation of cat- 
tle from provinces for slaughter

War Needs to 



Aid In Rehabilitation 

WASHINGTON — -Repox'ting to the American 
Senate Friday on his recent visit to the Philippines, 
Senator Millard Tydings asked Congress to make an 
outright gift of $100,000,000 to assist in rebuilding 
the war devastated areas. The chairman of President 
Truman s special investigating mission added that 
American aid in rehabilitation, however, must be 
limited by the shipping requirements of the armed 
services. 



* — - Last 2 Liberties Rolled C 

PORTLAND, MAINE— The launching 



Limit 



He suggested that the $100,- 
000,000 gift should be expend- 
ed by American Army and 
Navy engineers hi accordance 
With a program to be worked 
out by Congress, He felt that 
this sum would be a means of 
America showing its apprecia- 
tion of the heroism of the Fili- 
pinos who carried on the war 
ilone against the Japanese for 
three years, and later were of 
Invaluable assistance to the 
American forces. In regard to 
reimbursement for war dam- 
»ges p Tydings pointed out that 
from the war of 1776 on, the 
United States has never paid 
War damages to its own citizens. 

KOMULO LAUDS REPORT 

Following the report, Brig. 
Gen. Carlos P. Romulo, chair- 
man of the Philippine delega- 
tion at the United Nations con- 
ference, said in San Francisco; 
M I am sure the people of the 
Philippines will receive the sen- 
ator's report with gratitude, I 
tm confident that America will, 
is in the past } stand by us in 
our hour of need.' 1 

Tydings pointed to the dire 
need of food for the Philippines 
Mid the huge task of repairing 
the widespread devastation of 
war. He said that his mission 
had secured 8,000 tons of ship- 
ping for the Filipinos exclu- 
sively during June. He added: 
we anticipate that 30,000 tons 
of shipping will be available for 
the same purpose during July, 
and we expect there will be 
more thereafter." 

He said that the mission 
found Gen. MacArthur and his 
entire staff already greatly con^ 
cerned with the problem, and 
that the allocation of relief 
shipping resulted from joint 
discussions with the military 
Tydings emphasized that the 
shipping space will be short far 
short, of what is needed, but 
that is the best that can be 
done at this time. 

15 PERCENT DESTROYED 

He pointed out that the Phil- 
ippines are unable to supply 
Bufflcitot shelter, food and other 
materials for the hundreds of 
thousands of American troops 
now there and still to arrive. 
He added: "Obviously, these 
things must come first. The 
very lives of the Filipino and 
American soldiers depend on 
their having everything they 
deed to win a quid: victory. 1 ' 

Tydings outlined the dire 
situation of the Philippines as 
Follows; From 10 to 18 per cent 
of all the buildings in the 
Philippines have been destroy- 
ed, and possibly another lo 
Per cent have been damaged. 
«ns of thousands of Filipinos 
aie without shelter, food, cloth- 

m ° dical care * Light, 

KlL I n d , co *™ications 
sterns are almost totally des- 



troyed and inter-island trans- 
portation is nonexistent* 

The food situation is tragic, 
and there is a shortage of seeds, 
farming implements and work 
animals, which were killed off 
for food after the Japanese 
commandeered rice supplies, 
.No major steps have been taken 
to rehabilitate the sugar indus- 
try because no crops can be 
harvested for export probably 
before 1948. 

On the brighter side: Abaca 
and copra production can be 
restored to normal as soon as 
equipment and transportation 
are available. The American 
army has provided considera- 
ble relief food and clothing, 
and is doing a big job in the 
rehabilitation of Manila. It has 
put into operation the railroad 
from Manila to San Fernando, 
and has provided trucks and 
small craft to ease the trans- 
portation bottleneck. 

Tydings recommended that 
America maintain its military 
and naval bases in the Philip- 
pines, Marianas and Hawaii, 
got for purposes of throttling 
liberty or trade or for subjuga- 
tion, but as a guarantee of 
peace,

won glory in North Africa as the "Rats of Tobruk," poured ash on 
Sunday in the Brunei bay area on the west coast of Borneo, a.boi' 
150 miles south of the northern tip of the big island. 

Today's communique from Sen. MacArthur pointed ou 
that the new landing, in conjunction with the earlier mvasioi 
of Tarakan island on the east coast and almost directly scros 
Borneo from Brunei bay, puts Allied troops "not at the gate 
but the geographic center of the enemy occupied Celebei 
Bali, Java, Sumatra, Malaya and Indo-China area. His garrison 
there can now only await piece-meal destruction at will." 

Preceded by bombardment by Seventh Fleet cruiser; 
and destroyers and one Australian warship of each cate 
gory, the Australians made three landings between 9 an* 
10 o'clock in the morning, and established a fourth beach 
head in the afternoon. The troops that landed on th« 
mainland of Borneo at Brookton on the south side o 
the entrance to Brunei bay pushed rapidly inland 4,0(X 
yards to within 12 miles of the town of Brunei. Tb 
Japanese still hold an airstrip between the Australiaj 
vanguard and Brunei. 

All of the landings met only slight opposition excep 
for quite a number of land mines. Gen. MacArthur wen 
ashore in one of the assault waves in the first landinj 
on the southeast tip of Labuan island in the mouth o 

Brunei bay. (Continued on : ;:p. A

lief and Rehabilitation Administration" was proposed 
yesterday by Manuel L. Roxas, technical adviser to 
the Emergency Control Administration, 

The NARRA, which would have funds totalling 
P15,000,000 subscribed by the Commonwealth, would 
be empowered to extend crop loans, provide agricul- 
tural material, operate experimental laboratories and 
utilities, establish trading stores and cooperatives, 
and engage in manufacturing enterprises. Loans 
would be extended to farmers and tenants at interest 
rates not exceeding 5 percent.

rehabilitate Philippine agri- 
culture; 

1— Adopt intensive methods 
of production and, where 
possible, continuous cropping: 
systems; 

JJ — Diversify production, 
particularly in food crops; 

3— Rear milch cows, . piffs, 
poultry and cultivated fish; 

4 — Maintain fruit orchards 
and home gardens; 

5 — Eventually enable ten- 
ants to own their own land, 

Roxas pointed out that more 
scientific methods of cultivation 
would raise production, while 
the planting of fruit orchards 
and home gardens would enable 
farmers to supplement present 
income. To enable tenants to 
own their land, the NARRA 
would reserve, clear and aj>- 
portion in 24-hectare lots vast 
tracks of public agricultural 
land at present unused.

the favorable attitude of Com- 
monwealth representatives to- 
ward the plan* The Hawaiian 
delegation expects to confer 
with Sen, Millard Ty dings, 
chairman of the senate territo- 
ries committee, to encourage 
early passage of naturalization 
legislation for Filipinos and a 
larger immigration quota*

Suzuki Says 



Then It's 



Time to Rotate 

WASHINGTON— Here is a yardstick for measuring 
how long a person has been in Pacific island warfare, 
offered by Capt. Truman Hemingway, Jr., of Shelburne, Vh, 
who fought as a guerrilla in the Philippines for three years: 

"The first six months, if ants get in the food, the Ameri- 
can throws the food away. The second six months he picks 
out the ants but eats the food. The third six months he 
eats food, ants and all. The fourth six months, if any ants 
try to escape, he recaptures them and puts them back in 
the food where they belong." 



Aussies Invade . . . 

(Continued from front page) 

The surprised Japanese put 
ap such little resistance that 
only one casualty has been re- 
ported from this landing. The 
troops took the town of Labuan 
and its airfield and deep water 
harbor and then pushed one and 
a half miles northward. The 
Timbalai airfield on the west 
coast is located in the path of 
the advancing Australians. A 
second landing was made at 
Hamilton point on the peninsula 
forming one side of Labuan's 
harbor. The fourth landing was 
carried out on nearby Muara 
island. Str6ng naval and air 
bombardment supported all the 
assault waves. 

Accompanying Gen. Mac- 
Arthur as he went ashore on 
Labuan island were Gen. George 
C. Kenney, commanding the Far 
JJast Air Force; Rear Admiral 
Forrest B. Royal, heading the 
Seventh Fleet units; and Lt. 
Gen. Leslie Morshead, senior 
Australian commander. Other 
high naval officers taking part 
in the operation were Rear 
Admirals Russell S. Bertey and 
Ralph S. Griggs. 

Today's communique describ- 
ed the Brunei area as rich in 
oil, rubber, coal, lumber, iron 
and other resources. Number- 
less ships can anchor in the 500 
square miles of its sheltered 
bay, which formerly was an 
important Japanese naval base. 
The establishment of air and 
naval facilities at Brunei bay, 
combined with those in the 
Philippines, will complete a 
chain of mutually supporting 
strategic bases 1,500 miles long, 
from which air and naval forces 
are within continuous effective 
range of the Asiatic coast from 
Singapore to Shanghai. Thus 
planes can cut enemy overland 
lines of communication in Ma- 
laya and Indo-China, just as 
Philippines based bombers have 
already practically destroyed 
Japanese shipping in the South 
China sea. 

In the Philippines, XI corps 
units took the town of Santa 
Ines in the Marikina sector. 
The 37th Division consolidated 
its recent gains in the head- 
waters of the Cagayan valley 
while more than 100 fighter 
planes bombed and strafed 
throughout the valley. Several 
Japanese trucks were destroy- 
ed on Highway 4 where they 
were trapped by the seizure of 
Bagabag, junction of Highways 
4 and 5. 

American troops continued 
their slow advance through the 
Jungles of Mindanao. In the 
south, elements of X Corps ad- 
vancing up the Pulangi river 
captured Jasaan, ten miles east 
oi me Sayre highway. 



Batavia Flight 
Sets a Record 

"Longest mass bombing flight 
ever made by B-24's proved 
successful last week" as ele- 
ments of 13th Air Force, part 
of the MacArthur Command, 
attacked Batavia, Java, the 
capital of Indonesia. 

The 18-hour non-stop flight 
of more than 3,000 miles was 
the most significant develop- 
ment of the present offensive 
in which Yank airmen daily 
are increasing their attacks 
against Jap installations. 

The Liberators arrived over 
Batavia, a city of more than 
500,000 people, at night. Some 
of them diverted anti-aircraft 
batteries from a high altitude, 
while others swept in low to 
damage a destroyer, a sea plane 
base, and docks. 



Audience Gangs 
Up on Referee 

For making a quite ^po- 
pular decision, boxing referee 
Elino Flores was ^ assaulted 
last Saturday evening at tne 
Manila Square Garden pre- 
ceding the scheduled ligm- 
heavyweight championship 
fight between Nicky Wan OJ 
Manila and Gunboat Davis, 
Pennsylvania title-holder. 

Flores refereed the Johnny 
Cinto-Bobby Mann semi-final 
eight-round bout. Wh«a 
Flores raised Cinto's hand, in 
an unpopular decision several 
men climbed into the ring 
and started to pummel Flores 
with their bare fists. Flores 
jumped out of the ring only 
to fall into the hands of an 
infuriated crowd.

Democratic Senate 
For Bremen Revived 

BREMEN — The traditional 
senate of Bremen was revived 
here last week with members 
best described as city council- 
men having limited powers 
under the direction of Ameri-

cers, the N. Y. Herald Tribune

termed the extraordinary ses 
sion of "unprecedented im- 
portance." 

Suzuki declared the "war 
situation is becoming more 
acute, despite efforts made by 
the whole nation, and we have 
witnessed the advance of the 
enemy on Okinawa. 

"We have reached the time 
where we can expect the 
advance of the enemy at some 
time to other areas of our 
mainland. 

In this critical war situa- 
tion, there will be a shortage 
of food and difficulties in trans- 
portation. Furthermore, difficul- 
ties in the manufacture of 
munitions will increase. 

"Judging: from the trends 
within the enemy countries, 
and considering developments 
in the international situation, 
I cannot help feel strongly 
that the only way for us to 
do is to fight to the last." 
Domei revealed thai at "most 
important bill" to be introduced 
during the current session per- 
tains to a wartime emergency 
execution law to increase pro- 
duction of war industries, 
secure supply of food, strength- 
en communications, consolidate 
home defense, readjust war 
taxes, and deal with home front

Challenges Validity 
Of Banking Order 

Vicente Hilado, Manila law- 
y fv' ^Uenged the constitution- 
ality of Executive Order No 49 
recently promulgated by Presi- 
dent Osmena in a complaint filed 
yesterday with the court of first 
instance against the acting bank 
commissioner and the Philin- 
pine National Bank. 

The executive order which 
deci ares null and void all depo- 
sits m banks during the Jap- 
anese occupation but recognizes 
withdrawals made by a deposi- 
tor from bank balances as of the 
last day prior to the Japanese 
occupation was branded by 
Hilado as "unconstitutional."

Slaughter of Carahao 

Gov. Eulogio Rodriguez, Jr. 
of Rizal has requested all mayors 
of his province to see to it that 
no slaughter of carabaos be 
authorized, it was learned yes- 
terday. 

"In view of the depletion of 
the stock of work animals for 
agricultural purposes," the gw- 
ernor said in a circular, "public 
interest demand that the 
slaughter of c&i/afoaos for 1 
consumption whether the ani- 
mals be fit or unfit for agricul- 
tural purposes should be stopr?&d 
immediately." 

Last Day for Art Exhibit 

Today is the last day of

The show is sponsored by tne

by which we arrive at that goal 
it is what we are struggling 
for." He praised soldiers, 
sailors, air men and diplomats 
of America and Britain who 
realized that "only in unity is 
there strength." He said that in 
his prosecution of the war in 
the west he owed "an immea- 
surable debt of gratitude" to 
those men, pointing out that 
"they never once deviated from 
the instructions laid down." 

He added: "I know these 
men intimately and I know 
what they want. They want 
peace. They want an oppor- 
tunity for our farmers to 
raise a little more corn next 
#ear. They want an oppor- 
tunity for our miners to live 
a little better next year. 

"All of us who are right 
thinking want the common man 
I of all nations to have the op- 
| portunities that we fought to 
j preserve for them. They want 
1 opportunities that will let all 
nations that have been engaged 
in this war to go forward to- 
gether to greater prosperity — 
not for us sitting around this 
table — but for the masses that 
' represent." 

Eisenhower observed 
"While I am expressing what 
is in my heart and mind, I 
am speaking for no one else 
except Ike Eisenhower. 
But I believe that there is no 
one around this table that 
would not give back all the 
honors, all the publicity, 
everything else this war has 
brought to him, if he could 
have avoided the misery, the 
suffering and the debt that 
have been brought to popu- 
lations by reason .*f this 
war." 

Eisenhower, who received 
Soviet Russia highest award, 
the Order of Victory from 
Marshal Zhukov, also declared 
that the war just finished had 
been a holy war — more than 
any other in history. 

Describing Zhukov as a man 
to whom the U. S. owed a great 
debt he recalled that on two 
occasions he (Eisenhower) "had 
the great honor" of meeting 
high officials of the Soviet gov- 
ernment, adding, "it is my feel- 
ing that in the basic desires of 
all of us they are one with us." 

British Fiel<J Marshal Sir 
Bernard Montgomery also re- 
ceived the Soviet "Order of 
Victory" from Zhukov. 

Nearly 60 high ranking mili- 
tary figures from the three 
countries were present.

Treasury Blocks Transfer 
Of Looted Cheeks, Bonds 



?me PMMppilne Office ©2 
foreign funds control has 
taken action to prevent per- 
sons who have collaborated 
with Japanese or who have 
acquired or dealt in looted 
eksclis omci secutrltr.es from 
transferring their wealth 
from the Islands. 

Authoritative sources dis- 
closed there were a large 
amount of bearer bonds in 
the Philippines at the time of 
Japanese invasion. I. G. Alk, 
head of the U. S. Treasury 
representatives here, said his 
office would not permit any 
securities to be removed from 
the Philippines unless owner- 



ship was traced to January 1, 

1942. 

It was understood the 
treasury had already im- 
pounded securities where the 
holder was unable to explain 
satisfactorily hew he obtain- 
ed securities. 

Treasury officials warned 
no securities could be sent out 
of the Philippines without a 
license. In addition, no Phil- 
ippine securities could he 
handled in the United States 
unless the treasury depart- 
ment had attached a form in- 
dicating that it was satisfied 
with the chain of ownership 
<of the securities. 



"This action will make ft 
impossible for persons who 
have improperly acquired 
Philippine bearer bonds or 
other securities from obtain- 
ing any benefit from such 
securities," Alk said. 

A warning was also given 
that no checks or other finan- 
cial instruments which were 
within the Philippines dur- 
ing the Japanese occupation 
can be paid without a treas - 
ury license. These checks wiii 
he examinee! in order to 
make sure that they were not 
executed und^r duress or un- 
lawfully taken from the 
rightful owners.

Only seven of the original 13

Preliminary survey of the 
lumber situation by the bureau

75,000 board feet of lumber, 
mostly second hand, and 29,000 
board feet of logs were avail-

Because of the dearth of 
lumber in Manila at present 
one board foot now sells at 
P1.50 as against seven centavos 
per board foot before the war. 



3,600 U.S. Soldiers Die 
In Attacks on Troop Ships 

WASHINGTON— Some 3,600 American soldiers

The soldier losses on a total of 41 ships, covering 
41 months of war against Germany and Italy, repre- 
sented a loss of four men for every 10,000 that em- 
barked. The Army said this figure was nearly twice 
as small as that for the last war, when the rate was 7.2.

To Superiority of U.S. Tanks 

WASHINGTON — Gen. George S. Patton, Jr., 
comZnder ot V. S. Third Army 
European successes to superiority of American maae 

tank patton who was present at Secretary of War 

ThiXArmy" through 8 Africa, Sicily, and onjhe 

western front. 

The general termed the 
American light and medium 
££E Superior to anything put 

to achievements of the J-nuu 
Army which alone accounted 



unseen by the Japs to the 
river and swam it. It was a 
great break for both of us?* 
He gave us information on 
the Japs and told us the civil- 
ians were ready to be 
rescued, I assigned some men 
to the job right away. 

"They made some rafts and 
returned to the other bank. 
There the civilians were 
waiting for us although a few 
of the men had crossed the 
river in the meantime. My 
men searched the neighbor- 
hood, always with an eye on 
the Japs, and found several 
of the enemy's rafts. All of 



the civilians got across to us. 

"After three years under 
the Japs, they were in terri- 
ble shape. Some were mere 
skin and bones. They said 
that sometimes they had been 
rationed but one cup of rice 
for seven people for several 
days at a time. We took them 
in hand, fed them our C 
rations. They cried with joy, 
and so did I and my men, We 
sent some by ambulance to 
American hospitals near the 
Ipo fighting lines, and later 
they were taken to Manila 
for further aid and as- 
sistance." 



Soldier Surprised

An American soldier ap-

for the first time, was at Ma- 
lacanan yesterday. He ap- 
proached a Filipino guard at 
the gate and asked if he 
could have a guide to show 
him the Malacanan 
grounds, The GI explained 
that back in Washington, 
Da C, guides are available 
for those who wish to be 
taken through the White 
House grounds. 

Jesse Belio, guerrilla, who 
happened to be around, in- 
tervened, told the soldier that 
there are no such guides in 
Malacanan, but that he might 
get in and go around by him- 
self, Bcllo further informed 
him he could even see the 
President if he wanted to, 
The GI grinned and exclaim- 
ed: "Say, you have more de-

wealth delegation to the United 
Nations conference declared 
Wednesday the goal of inde-

all the colonial peoples of the 

Romulo's statement, repres-

trusteeship, but for all inde- 
pendent peoples.

Sees No Hope for Alleviating 
Current Meat Shortage in U. S. 

SEATTLE, WASH.— Rep. Clinton P. Anderson said 
Seattle yesterday the current meat shortages catnot possibly 
be alleviated until spring of 1946. 

Anderson is chairman of the House of Representatives 
investigating committee which is conducting Hearings in 
Seattle on national food shortages. 

He predicted that pork, "shortest meat of all, probably 
will not appear on American markets until f,he late summer of 

1946." , j 

According to Anderson, butter Is also very scarce and 
only an abundant production of meat, poultry, butter and 
other rationed foods will cure the nation's Mack marke ts.

Guerrillas Make Possible 

In Philippines 

Mindanao Abaca HarvestM*^ 



Guerrillas, closing in behind General MacArthur's men in Mindanao were 
largely responsible for the first shipment of abaca to arrive here from the 
enemy-infested island in almost four years. 

Guerrillas helped strip the fifcer and load the ship while Japanese were 
fighting from hills five miles away. First shipment consisting of 2,200 piculs of 
high grade fiber arrived last Thursday. Another ship ment of similar quantity 
was due to arrive Sunday. P * — " ~ 

wi«h thejt*™ of .he b,oo, stilwell Back; Sees No 

Sign of Jap Crackup Yet 

General Joseph Stilwell, commander of U. S. 
Army Ground Forces, told a press conference here 
Sunday that "I see nothing to indicate the J#ps will 
crack up anywhere." 

The former commander of U. S, Army forces m 
China and Burma, back in Manila after a visit to the 

fighting fronts on Okinawa, declared : 

"1 think they will be loathe^ 
to give up what they have 
grabbed on the continent, I ex- 
pect they'll fight for it." 

General Stilwell revealed he 
was making a tour of the Pa- 
cific fighting fronts principally 
to look into the matter of re- 
placements "to make sure we 
are on the right track in our 
training in the United States." 
He said units without excep- 
tion have expressed themselves 
highly satisfied with what they 
were getting, 

"There never has been any 
better soldier material in the 
history of the world than we 
are getting now," Stilwell 
declared. 

Asked how defeat of Japan 
can be hastened, he said: "Her 
navy is practically gone. Her 
air force is so nearly gone that 
it presents no threat. Our sol- 
diers have proven to their 
satisfaction that they can lick 
them on the ground. All we 
have to do now is concentrate 
all our aieans for the final 
blow." 

With respect to re-training 
of troops from Europe for fight- 
ing in the Pacific, General Stil-

region and Mindanao, where 
nearly all of the plantations 
were in Jap hands, it was hoped 
this most war-scarce of strate- 
gic materials may soon be off 
the short supply list. The fiber, 
commonly known as Manila 
hemp, goes into the manufac- 
ture of ropes and cables for 
ships, 

"We hope this is the begin- 
ning of a continuous flow to 
Manila so that the mills can 
keep going," a Foreign Econo- 
mic Administration official said. 
This was an outstanding exam- 
ple of how guerrillas could be 
of assistance in civil rehabili- 
tation as well as in fighting, he 
pointed out. 

The hemp industry was one 
of the principal sources of live- 
lihood of the people in the Bi- 
col provinces and Mindanao 
prior to the war. Its rehabilita- 
tion is the first to be under- 
taken by the FEA mission, 
which is here to help restore 
private trade. 

Some abaca was brought to 
Manila from the Bicol provin- 
ces about three weeks ago. Pur- 
chase was made P^^jgf 
cash and partly with goods, 
principally food supplies. FEA 
nien said the people more 
eager to receive goods than 
money. __ 

As fast as the fiber can be 
brought to Manila, it w« be 
Srown into the Elizalde Mills 
to be manufactured into rope. 
The FEA is now taking steps 
?o rehabilitate a ^wnd toctog. 
that of Manila Corda ge J 
Manufacture of rope locally 
saves much space on ships 
carrying supplies to the Unit 
ed States. 



Free Belgian 
Cabinet Quits 

BRUSSELS — The Belgian 
government has tendered its re- 
signation to Prince Charles bo- 
fore King Leopold's return to 
Belgium, Premier Achilles Van 
Acker announced yesterday. 

The announcement said "It 
would he impossible for the gov- 
ernment to administer current 
affairs after the king's return/' 
in view of the fact that it would 
necessarily include the mainten- 
ance of public order and poli- 
tical responsibility for utter- 
ances by the king. The govern- 
ment suggested that the king 
form a new government before 
his return to Belgium,

General MacArthur's 
Sunday communique an- 
nounced during the past 
week 9,210 enemy dead had 
been counted and 1,037 pris- 
oners taken, the largest 
total of Jap prisoners ever 
taken in any week in the 
Philippines. 

The GHQ spokesman said on 
Saturday I Corps killed over 
1,200 Japs in the Cagayan Val- 
ley. 

On Luzon alone, 035 Japs 
were taken prisoner last 
week, while 102 were taken in 
other parts of the Philippines. 
Last week 6,912 Jap dead 
were counted on Luzon, 2,£9& 
in other parts of the Islands. 

Our own casualties for the 
same? period were 103 killed, 
2 missing and 522 wounded, 
Cumulative enemy casualties 
have risen to 402,303 for the 
Philippine campaign, as com- 
pared with our total casualties 
uf slightly over 50,000. 

On Luzon leading elements of 
the 37th Division drove forward 
13 miles, reaching the town of 
Cauayan, 18 miles northeast of 
Eehague, and are fanning out 
along the road nets of the Ca- 
gayan Valley, the communis im 
said, 

The spokesman said the 
6th Infantry captured a Nazi 
flag wrapped in a Japanese 
army blanket. The flag was 
found by a forward artillery 
observer who was checking 
on a large enemy convoy 
which the air force had 
bombed* He came across the 
bundle in a rice paddy. 

In Mindanao, reduction of 
widely dispersed enemy rem- 
nants continued, The 24th Divi- 
sion was still tied up with it's 
destruction of enemy strong 
points in the Davao area. 

Australian forces were ac- 
tively patrolling Brunei Bay 
area and development of bases 
continued. Medium bombers 
and fighters swept enemy lines 
of communication in northern 
Borneo while*heavy units drop- 
ped 130 tons on anti-aircraft 
positions at Balikpapan and the 
nearby Sepinggan airfield. 

Over Formosa escorted heavy 
and medium bombers dropped 
260 tons of incendiaries and de- 
molitions on Taichu and Oka- 
seki alrbases and storage areas 
at Rokko.

MISSING 



Gtin* tit house 384 in Siinto Tomns, 



ABOARD A U. S. DESTROYER IN NORTH PA- 
CIFIC (Delayed) —U. S. naval units in the North 
Pacific shelled Japan's principal central Kuriles island 
bastion, Matsuwa twice in 24 hours in long distance 
daylight sweeps far from friendly air cover, a news 
dispatch said. 

Thousands of pounds of shells were dumped on 
the sombrero shaped island, 48Q miles northeast 
of the Japanese home islands. 

Roar Admiral J, H- Brown, $ 
Jr., took the task force of 
cruisers and destroyers through 
heavy seas to close to shore 
in a pea soup fog. 

The destroyer's decks were 
awash and the gun crew was 
drenched by cold seas as they 
fired at the island they couldn't 
see by instrument. Several 
thousand shells were expended 
in the first 20 minutes of the 
bombardment. 

The task force was back the 
next afternoon. As it formed a 
column for the bombardment 
run, the fog lifted around the 
towering Fuyo Yama volcano 
and exposed the entire island. 

This destroyer's target was 
the airstrip which it blanketed 
with shells to keep down any 
Japanese planes. Many direct 
hits were scored on the air 
fields. 

Not a shot was fired from the 
shore in either of the attacks 
and there was no sign of enemy 
airplanes* 

These were the fourth and 
fifth bombardments of the vol- 
canic island which is used by 
the enemy for a staging grounds 
for the northern Kuriles* It is 
an important air route between 
the Paramushiro and home 
islands*

HOSPITAL GROUP FORMS 

Directors of different private 
hospitals in Manila met last 
week at the St.. Joseph's Hospi- 
tal On Calle Balmes, San Miguel, 
and organized the "Manila Pri- 
vate Hospitals Association" in 
preparation for restoration of 
all private hospitals to owners 
by the U. S. army on July 1. 



General Hospital 
Treats 31,616 

A total of 31,616 persons 
have been given medical treat- 
ment at the General Hospital 
on Espana street, Sampaloc, 
from February to March, this 
year, according to Dr. Pe del 
Mundo, hospital directress. 

This number represented 
2,788 patients confined during 
the period, 27,460 treated in the 
dispensary, 436 in the surgical 
and gynecological department 
and 932 in the emergency ward. 
Bulk of the patients came from 
Manila, although a number of 
emergency cases from nearby 
provinces were admitted from 
time to time. Dr. Del Mundo 
said the hospital may eventually 
be converted into a unit of the 
Philippine General hospital for 
the Manila north- district on 
account of the great damage 
done to the PGH buildings on 
Taft avenue. 



70 Percent of 
U.S. Arms in 
Europe Usable 

WASHINGTON— The IL S<

of its equipment in Europe is 
still battle-worthy for nse

War Department estimate to the 
Senate sub-committee on war 
contracts, a press dispatch said 
yesterday. 

Robert A. Hurley, a member 
of the Surplus Property Board, 
advised the committee, headed by 
Sen. Joseph C. O'Mahoney, De- 
mocrat of Wyoming, that Army 
officials say the surplus war 
materials in Europe "will be a 
great deal' less than the first 
anticipated." 

"They plan to move every- 
thing they can to the Pacific," 
Hurley added.

Mickey Mouse Victim 

When Crisanta Vcr&ara 
of C a I a m b a, La&una, 
agreed to sell a bundle of 
clothes to a stranger her 
eyes popped at the Bight of 
a PS atop a wad of money 
he handed her for the ap- 
parel. 

Crisanta paused at the 
sight of so much money — 
instead of counting it. The 
stranger had vanished 
when she discovered the 
rest of the bills was worth- 
less Jap money. 

The swindler had dump-

her hands for the bundle 
valued at P785. 



U.S. Can Fill 
Only 20% of 
Island Needs 

Rice production of the 
Philippines fox* 1945 will 
be, at most, hardly over 
half of normal, according 
to Capt Ricardo T. Mar- 
fori, Officer-in-C h a r g e, j 
Agricultural Rehabilita- 
tion Section of the Office 
of the President 

The Philippines needs at least 
27,000,000 cavans of rice a year 
and the amount ordered from 
the United States will fill bare- 
ly one -fifth of our need, Mar- 
fori disclosed. If the Philippines 
wants to cat, she must pro- 
duce, he said. 

The price of almost every 
commodity hinges upon the 
price of rice, and amount of 
rice available determines the 
price it commands, Marfori 
pointed out. On the other 
hand, rice production will de- 
pend on availability of seeds, 
work -allium Is, implements 
and manpower. It is the pre- 
sent task of the Government 
to utilize to the utmost what- 
ever of these are available, 
Marfori said, 

"The Government h trying 
to do just that/' he declared. 

Six agricultural experiment 
stations have already been re- 
opened by the Government, ac- 
cording to Marfori. They are 
the Central Experiment Sta- 
tion in Ma late, Manila; the 
Lipa Citrus Experiment Sta- 
tion in Lipa, Batangas; the Los 
Banos Economic Garden in Los 
Banos, Lag una; the Lamao Ex- 
periment Station in Limay, Ba- 
taan; the Moligaya Rice Expe- 
riment Station in Munos, Nueva 
Ecija; and the Abuyog Abaca 
Sub-Station in Abuyog, Leyte. 
With a total area of 920 hec- 
tares, 332.7 hectares are now

37th Division 
In High Gear 
In North Luzon 

American forces conti- 
nued to advance Sunday 
on all sectors in northern 
Luzon, with the 37th Divi- 
sion pushing down the 
Cagayan valley to within 
8,500 yards of the "town of 
Naguilian, according to 
today's communique from 
Gen. Mac Arthur, The 
column of the 37th that 
swung along the west side 
of the valley has joined 
the main force moving 
down Highway 5, 

Since fighting through 
Orioung pass near Cordon, 
sorae 30 miles behind today's 
front line, the 37th Division has 
advanced so rapidly that at 
times the troops were ahead of 
the tactical maps based on 
aerial reconnaissance. 

There also were occasions 
when the artillery had to 
move three times in 24 hours 
to keep up with the advance. 
In Sunday's fighting, the 37th 
killed ISO Japanese and cap- 
tured 65. 
The Sixth Division pushed 
west of Bambang, about 60 
miles back of the 37th Divi- 
sion's front, in a drive against 
Japanese in the mountains who 
were by-passed in the advance 
of the 37th, The Sixth Division 
troops met stiff opposition, kill- 
ing 70 Japanese and capturing 
or destroying 11 machine gun 
posts and 24 pill boxes or caves, 
Almost due west, the 33rd Divi- 
sion north of Baguio drove east 
to take Bokod town. At the 
eastern end of the Marikina 
sector, the First Cavalry killed 
Vil Japanese and found 90 more 
dead, and cit Infanta, on the 
east coast, killed 76 and took 
22 prisoners. 

The Australian Ninth divi- 
sion continued its drive south- 
west of Brunei town Sunday

Filipino Mission Requested 
To Survey Hawaii Conditions 

War Correspondent Ricardo Labez of the Honolulu 
fatar-BuIIetin suggested to President Osmena yesterday 
that a Filipino mission could be sent to Hawaii to survey 
the condition of thousands of Filipinos in the Islands, 
The President promised to act favorably on the matter, 

President Osmena was in-<$ - — ^ 

terested in providing facilities 
for Filipinos in Hawaii to help 
in rehabilitation of the Philip- 
pines. Labez pointed out that 
Hawaii-Filipinos have earned 
and saved millions which could 
be invested in the Philippines, 

Steps arc at present being- 
taken to organize a Resident 
Commissioner's office in Hawaii 
to represent the Filipinos. Ma- 
lacanan is studying who to ap- 
point for the position. The 
President is thinking of sen ding- 
either a laborite ov a newspaper- 
man, it was pointed out yester- 
day, to head the Hawaii office.

Lauds Quick. 
Oroku Victory 

NAHA, OKINAWA — Maj, 
Gen, Roy S. Geiger, commander 
of the Third Amphibious Corps 
of the 10th Army, Friday con- 
gratulated troops of Maj, Gen, 
Lemuel C. Shepherd's Marine 
Gth Division on their quick con- 
quest of the Japanese Oroku 
naval base and the Oroku pen- 
insula. 

Concurrently, Shepherd pres- 
ented Geiger with a captured 
Japanese flag taken in the un- 
derground stronghold of the pen- 
insula, described by the Sixth 
Division assistant commander, 
Brig. Gen, William T. Clement, 
as "fifty percent stronger than 
Corregidor" when it was an 
American fortress at the out- 
break of the war. 

Clement based his comparison 
on first-hand knowledge of the 
Philippine fortress which he 
helped build.

Names 335,000 Filipino 
Guerrillas on Needy List 

WASHINGTON — War Food Administrator 
Marvin Jones said in a radio broadcast Sunday night 
that .demands for American food were greater now 
than at any time during the war. 

As a result, U, S. civilians will have smaller sup- 
plies of some of their favorite foods than during any 
other year of the war, he added* 

It was in the nation's inter-®" 
est, Jones pointed out, to help 



provide food for millions of 
starving peoples in liberated 
European nations. Otherwise 
the fruits of war will be lost 
and chaos might result, "Per- 
manent peace cannot be had in 
a hungry world," he said. 

He explained shortages in 
some key items were not due 
to lack of production, but to 
greatly increased demands. In 
addition to feeding U. S. mil- 
itary forces "we have helped 
feed several hundred thous- 
and Fighting French soldiers, 
19,000 Brazilian soldiers, 300,- 
GUfl Italians in service units, 
and 335,000 Filipino guerrillas 
who have greatly helped us 
in our pacific, war. 

"Our army has to feed mil- 
lions of prisoners of war to 
supply relief needs of liberated 
people for a period of at least 
six months. 

4 'Russian officials have told 
us that but for American food, 
they could not have turned 
back the German hordes at Sta^ 
lingrad and Leningrad. 

"It was American food that 
helped throw the balance in 
England's darkest hour. If we 
have been wasteful in the use 
of food as well as all other 
supplies, it is because we de- 
liberately chose to spend ma- 
terials instead of men. 

M American food, like other 
materials of war," Jones em- 
phasized, "must go forward 
with our armies until the Jap- 
anese empire is crushed, until 
our victory is complete, and a 
free world has a chance to 
build itself anew."

CHUNGKING— The Chinese

Being Flown Across Atlantic 

Presque Isle, Maine, air base 
Annrfnv in onenin£ the Jarg- 



NEW YORK— Some 14,000 
veterans of the first Ameri- 
can army combat to return as 
a unit— the 86th Blackhawk 
infantry of the Third Army 
—are being flown across the 
Atlantic, later to battle in the 
Pacific* Their homecoming 
inaugurates a program sched- 
uled to bring 50,000 troops to 
this country by air. 

Three giant 054 transport 
planes, spanning the Atlantic 
day and night over the 
"snowball" route, deposited 69 
veterans of the African and 
European battlefront at the 



Sunday in opening 
est air transport job in his- 
tory. 

After visiting home, they 
will be speedily processed 
and have 30 days more in the 
U. S. before sailing for war 
against the Japanese. - 

The Blackhawks left the 
U. S. last February 1 to be- 
come the first division to 
cross the Danube into Hitler's 
mountain redoubt. 

The men will be assigned 
new tropical uniforms on 
their arrival, and then will be 



sent to 22 redevelopmei 
centers throughout the cour 
try by special trains. Othc 
troops are arriving daily < 
Connecticut and Florida ftele 
and by surface ships in N. 1 
Because the Elackhaw 
Division was a comparative! 
fresh unit, and suffered rela 
lively light casualties, it wa 
selected as the first com pie t 
division to be sent Japan 
wards. 

About 2G\000 liberated pris 
oners of war and troops fo: 
reassignment have returnee 
home thus far.

Enemy Resistance Cracks 
On Okinawa; Japs Fleeing 

GUAM — American 10th Army troops, minus their commander, Lt. 
Simon BoUver Buckner, who was killed by Japanese shellfire, closed in Monday 
against the last Japanese pocket as "enemy resistance on Okinawa was break- 
ing and Japanese troops were fleeing in the open toward cliffs at the southern 
end of the island," yesterday's Pacific Fleet communique announced.

Nine Traffic 
Deaths Occur 
In Four Days 

Pedestrian death toll 
from motor car accidents 
sharply increased during 
the past four days when out 
of 11 deaths registered 
from Friday to Monday in- 
clusive, 9 pedestrians were 
killed, the traffic division 
of the Manila police depart- 
ment announced yesterday. 

Judging by the number of 
fatalities totalling 23 up to and 
including June 18, the May 
figure of 27 deaths from motor 
car accidents would be surpassed 
at the present rate, police 
warned. 

The increase in pedestrian 
fatalities was attributed by 
traffic officers to carelessness 
of the public in observing traf- 
fic rules and regulations. 

Out of the 9 pedestrians killed 
during the past four days, 6 
were hit by motor vehicles while 
crossing- the street on a prohi- 
bited area and for walking 
the road with the traffic. 



Elements of the Second 
Marine Division had gone into 
action on Okinawa, fighting 
along with the First and Sixth 
Marine Divisions, it was dis- 
closed. Attacking before dawn, 
the Marines reached the area ox 
the highway running inland 
from Nagusuku on the south- 
west coast to Makabe> two miles 
from Okinawa's tip. 

"Tenth Army troops," the 
communique said, "broke 
through Japanese defenses in 
all sectors of the front during 
the day against resistance 



w h i c h was crumbling and 
diminishing at nightfall/' 

In the center of the line, 9 6th 
Division infantry pushed south- 
ward across the Yaeju-Dake 
escarpment against heavy nre 
from caves and pillboxes to 
within 3,000 yards from the tip 
of Okinawa. 

The remaining Japanese, now 
estimated at perhaps no more 
than 10,000 strong, were con- 
fined to an area less than eight 
square miles by Monday night.

No comment was received 
from Gen. Valdes, at present 
sick with malignant malaria. 

The Department of Infomuu 
tion announced yesterday that 
the selection of Gen, Valdes was 
made after a conference between 
President and General Mac- 
Arthur, who fully concurred in 
the selection of Gen, Valdes. . 

President Osmcna's offer of 
the Philippine Division has re- 
cently been accepted by General 
MacArthur, whom the President 
consulted as to how the Divi- 
sion should be constituted.

Osmena Submits PI 37,000,000 
Budget for Next Fiscal Year 



on 



h. Bnckner Killed 
Enomy Shellfire 



President Osmemi submitted the National Budget for the fiscal year ending 
June 30, 1946 to Philippine Congress Monday evening, proposing a total outlay 
of 1*137,136,619.50. 

In an accompanying message, the President ex- 
plained that due to paralysis of business, destruction 
of industries and disruption of foreign trade, "it is 
impossible at this time to make an estimate of the 
income of the government for the fiscal year 1946 
with any degree of accuracy." 

He added: "It is certain, however, that revenue 
collections will be meager and far from sufficient to 
meet the necessary expenses of the government for 
urgent and essential services."

"It is obvious/' wrote Presi- 
dent Osmena to Congress, "that 
the finances of the government 
are in a very precarious condi- 
tion. The government has con- 
sidered the advisability of float- 
ing bonds, of securing a revi-

MIDWAY — American determination to wreck 
Japan's supply lines and drive its ships from the 
Pacific has converted Midway island into one of the 
nation's most important submarine bases, a news dis- 
patch revealed yesterday. 

With the task nearing completion, the- Navy 
Department has permitted the disclosure of Midway's 
part in the battle for the Pacific, 

Actually, Midway is compos-^ . 

ed of two tiny islands, Sand 
and Eastern, separated by 
about a mile of jade green reef 
water. 

One of these islands has be- 
come an immense machine shop 

and rest center for submarines 

and their crews. The other 

houses installations of another 

service branch. 

When Capt. John K. Jayne 

hit the shore of Midway, early 

in 1942, there was little but 

sand. Capt William K, Oregan 

had started transforming the 

island into a submarine repair 

station, so he and Capt. Jayne 

worked together. 

First Midway was to be only 

a repair station. It was after 

the battle of Midway in June, 

1942, that the Navy began to 

see the vast potentialities of 

employment of the island as a 

submarine base to both repair 

and refit underseas craft ply- 
ing Japanese waters, 
Jayne directed much of the 

construction of installations, all 

carried out by submarine men. 

Later, he left for a tour of sub- 
marine duty in the western 

Aleutians, a berth at Pearl 

Harbor and work in the states- 
After his return to Midway, 

where he had first served as an 

executive officer,. Jayne became 

commander of a submarine 

unit. He now can provide com- 
plete repair and refitting faci- 
lities for several submarines 

simultaneously. Just how many 

is a Navy secret. 



trial, including Maj. Gen. Bro 
nisi aw Okulicki, commander of 
the Polish underground army; 
Jan Jankowski, vice premier of 
the Polish government in Lon- 
don and chairman of the under- 
ground council of ministers in 
Poland; and Adam Bien, lead- 
ing member of the Polish Pea- 
sant party, 

* Okulicki was quoted as testi- 
fying he had received orders 
from the Polish government in 
London to preserve the Home 
Army "in a condition of ille- 
gality." 

The secretary of the military 
collegium of the Supreme Court 
told the judges that Okulicki 
and 15 other Polish leaders had 
confessed to a long list of 
charges, including 594 Russian 
officers killed, anti-Soviet es- 
pionage and conferring with 
Germans. Okulicki declared 
that he would defend himself. 

Stanislaw Mikolajczyk, for- 
mer premier of the London 
Polish regime, is in Moscow for 
conferences on reorganization 
of the Warsaw Provisional gov- 
ernment with Allied officials.

Bridges Wins 
Court Battle 

WASHINGTON — The U. S. 
Supreme Court yesterday re- 
versed a lower court order for 
deporting Harry Bridges, the 
West Coast Longshoremen's 
Union executive, a CXO, affi- 
liate. 

Justice Douglas delivered the 
court's five to three opinion, 
while Chief Justice Stone de- 
livered the dissenting opinion. 
Justice Jackson did not partici- 
pate in the case. 

Justice Douglas said the 
lower court's deportation order 
was made "on a misconstruc- 
tion of the term Affiliation* as 
used in the statute and by rea- 
son of an unfair hearing on the 
question of his membership in 
the Communist Party his de- 
tention was unlawful," Douglas 
added: 

"Certainly those who joined 
forces with Russia to defeat the 
Nazis may not be said to have 
made an alliance to spread the 
cause of Communism/ 1

WASHINGTON— The bombing reports on the four 
Japanese industrial cities that were raided by a very 
large force of B-29 ? s Monday are revealed by the 21st 
Bomber Command headquarters as ranging from good 
to excellent over the widely scattered targets. 

Outta, on the island of Kyushu, and Yokkaichi on 
Honshuj were attacked for the first time while Hamma- 
matsu, on Honshu and Kagoshima on Kyushu, which 
had been the target of earlier strikes, were hit again by 
Super Fortresses of the 21st Bomber Command. 
The bombing was with incen

GUAM — Third Amphi-

day broke through to the 
southern coast of Okinawa 
Tuesday, splitting rem- 
nants of four Japanese 
armies into two pockets, 
Pacific Fleet headquarters 
announced yesterday. 

Enemy resistance grew weak- 
er through the day in all sec- 
tors, according to Fleet Admiral 
Chester W. Nimitz, who said 
that the enemy's defenses on 
southern Okinawa "were in the 
process of collapsing." 

Final resistance in the final 
phase of the 80-day-old battle 
was centered in the southwest- 
ern corner of\ the island and 
around Hill 81. Their strength 
was estimated at less than 
10,000 men. 

"Numerous enemy person- 
nel were reported jumping 
off cliffs near the coast," the 
communique said. 
Correspondents said southern 
Okinawa was the scene of wild- 
est confusion as , elements of 
five American divisions drove 
southward for the kill. Many 
Japanese soldiers were surren- 
dering along with thousands of 
Okinawa civilians.

SAN FRANCISCO — In the most demonstrative 
public session of the United Nations yet held, approval 
by acclamation was given yesterday to Mexico's de-

Spain from membership in the United Nations

The conference did not expressly exclude Franco 
Spain from membership in the United Nations but its 
endorsement of the general Mexican statement had 
that effect. *

the Axis powers and sympa- 
thizer with their war aims, 
Quintanilla proposed that his 
general statement be incorpor- 
ated in the report of the rappor- 
teur of the committee on mem- 
bership, then being considered 
by the parent commission. 

The statement expressed the 
opinion bf the Mexican delega- 
tion that no regime created by 
the help of Axis military forces 
should be admitted to the Unit- 
ed Nations. It did not mention 
any state or government.

Drive Rolls 
Unchecked In 
Cagayan Valley 

The American 37th 
Division drove forward in 
the Cagayan valley of 
northern Luzon Tuesday 
to liberate Ilagan, capital 
of Isabela province, and 
seize the nearby airstrip. 
Today's communique from 
Gen. MacArthur added 
that the troops of the 37th 
brushed aside scattered 
opposition to roll on north* 
of Ilagan. 

To the west, the Sixth", 25th 
and 33rd Divisions, the latter 
north of Baguio, are probing 
into the mountains and liqui- 
dating enemy parties who are 
cut off on the north by guer- 
rilla forces. 

In Mindanao, guerrillas seiz- 
ed the town of Baylo in the 
Agusan river valley. American 
flyers dropped 204 tons of 
bombs in support of ground 
operations in the Philippines. 

Fifth Air Force heavy bomb- 
ers taking off from bases in the 
Philippines started many fires 
Monday at Keelung in northern 
Formosa. The foup-motored 
planes dropped over 200 tons 
of bombs in the second conse- 
cutive attack on the harbor city. 
Carrying an additional 72 tons 
of fire bombs, fighters wiped 
out the town of Kari, north of 
Tainan, and hit Toyohara air- 
drome. Four planes were lost 
in the. widespread destructive 
attacks. 

Units of the Australian Ninth 
Division made a shore-to-shore 
landing Monday at Mempakul 
at the northern head of Brunei 
Bay on the west coast of Bor- 
neo. The landing, preceded by 
artillery bombardment from 
nearby Labuan island, gives the 
Australians control of both 
sides of the entrance to the bay. 

Heavy bombers and fighters 
of the 13th Air Force continued 
to pound Balikpapan, Manggar 
and nearby airfields on the east 
coast of Borneo where they 
dropped over 150 tons of bombs.

in Central Luzon 
revealed even big rice planters 
have lost their good seeds, ac- 
cording to the Agricultural Re- 
habilitation Section. The Mali 
pya Rice Experiment Station 
has supplied the Cojuangco 
family with 330 cavans of siied 
palay of the 2,000 cavans so far 
produced, it was pointed out. 

Out of a total rice hectaraire 
of 2,000,000 before the war, 
about 500,000 hectares were 
raising standard good yielding 
varieties. The government 
hopes that not all this heetar- 
a#e has been lost— the result of 
almost half a century of inces- 
sant work. 

A survey made in Leyte soon 
after the American landing re- 
vealed a great reduction of 
farming areas and the need for 
cereal and vegetable seeds. The

by the section, distributed some 
500 cavans of seed palay, about 
300 cavans of corn seeds, and 
some quantities of imported 
vegetable seeds. 

Meanwhile, insecticides, fun- 
gicides and fertilizers are being 
procured through the IT. S. 
Army from the United States 
by the commonwealth govern- 
ment to cut further reduction of 
the expected crop harvests this

Nations structure for peace 
swung into place Tuesday at the 
United Nations conference with 
commission approval of charter 
provisions for peaceful settle- 
ment of disputes. 

These charter provisions set 
forth many of the means by 
which international disputes 
may be settled and obligated 
member states to employ these 
means, Among them were ne- 
gotiation, inquiry, mediation, 
conciliation, arbitration, judicial 
settlement and resort to regional 
agencies* If states involved fail 
to settle disputes by those means 
the security council may call 
upon them to do so* 

Aside from that significant 
action, most of the day at the

for captured Japanese air- 
craft, declared the two new 
hifrh speed fighters are based 
upon German designs with 
Japanese developments and 
improvements. 

These types are called the 
"George" and the "Jack." 
They represent considerable 
improvement on the old Tojo 



and Zckc which used to give 
American planes trouble when 
flown by Japan's one-time 
first string pilots, 

"Japan's* biggest trouble," 
he said; "is the lack of mecha- 
nical safety. They sacrificed 
safety ^ for decreased weight 
that will permit greater speed 
and maneuverability," 



The Japanese are also ofter: 
hampered* by the inability oj 
comparatively incompetent 
workers to carry out well pre- 
pared plans of the designers

Base Equipment company. 

The bridge is an H-20 type 
consisting of steel frame and 
Trusses resting on piling driven 
nto the bed of the river to a 
-naximum depth of 74 feet. Be- 
sides the steel, approximately 
'35 tons of lumber were used

Finds New Way 
To Use Camote 

A new way to substitute 
camote for rice has been 
discovered by Dr. Manuel 
L. Roxas, technical adviser 
to the Emergency Control 
Administration, it was dis- 
closed at the ECA's office 
yesterday.' 

Camote, cut into small 
pieces, more or less the 
size of rice, can be dried, 
according to Dr. Roxas, 
and will keep indefinitely. 

Dr. Roxas has designed 
a machine which can cut 
and dry camote in less 
than hour. The process 
may be adapted to mass 
production of camote not 
only for home consump- 
tion but for commercial 
purposes.

equity to debtor-creditor rela- 
tionship. 

Mauro Mendez, undersecre- 
tary of information, explained 
to newsmen yesterday that, "in 
effect, the recommendation 
would validate payments, other 
than by renewal, made during 
the Japanese occupation on 
debts outstanding on the last 
date prior to the occupation, on 
a basis of the ratio that the 
Japanese war note bore to the 
Commonwealth peso on the date 
the payment was made." 

Payments made on debts due 
to banking institutions through 
charge to a pre-occurjation de- 
posit balance would be given 



full credit without regard to the 
ratio, it was explained. 

The President's banking ad- 
viser, according to the Infor- 
mation Spokesman, recom- 
mends that debts incurred dur- 
ing the Occupation period and 
paid during the same period be 
considered "completed trans- 
actions" and the debt fully dis- 
charged. 

With respect to debts incur- 
red during the Occupation and 
still outstanding and also to 
pre-occupation debts repaid 
during the occupation, the re- 
commendation is to hold 
debtors liable for interest 
covering the period of enemy 
occupa tion.

cArthur Names Stilwell 
Head U.S. Tenth Army 




Joseph W. Sfiiwell, until last year 
,d of ali American Army forces in 
Burma-India theater, last night was 
named commander of 
the U. S. 10th /\rmy on 
Okinawa by General 
Douglas MacArthur. 

The transfer of the 
Army ground forces 
commander to the post 
vacated by death in 
action of Lt. Gen. Si- 
mon Bolivar Buckner 
was announced at 
General MacArthur's 
rs last night in the following state- 

MacArthur announced today that 
»h W. Stilwell has been assigned to 
fes Arrhy Forces in the Pacific and 



1 



has been selected by Gen. MacArthur for the 
command of the Tenth Army in replacement of 
Gen Simon Bolivar Buckner. The Tenth Army 
at Okinawa is at present under the operational 
control of Admiral of the Fleet Nimitz." 

Stilwell recently made a tour of the Pa- 
cific fighting fronts, including a visit to Oki- 
nawa, and left after a stay at MacArthur's 
headquarters. He was still in the Pacific area 
when informed of his new post and will take 
over h:s command as soon as he arrives at 
Okinawa. Gen. Roy S. Geiger, head of the 
Third Marine Amphibious Corps, had tempo- 
rarily taken over Buckner's command. 

Stilwell left his China-Burma-India com- 
mand, late last year to become chief of -the 
army ground forces training program. The 
Tenth Army, of which he is now head, was or- 
ganized in Hav/aii last fall by Buckner, who was 
transferred from his Alaska command.

Organized Fighting 
Folds After 82 Days 

BULLETIN 

GUAM — Organized Japanese resistance on Oki- 
nawa ceased Wednesday, a special communique from 
Fleet Admiral Nimitz's headquarters announced last 
night. 

The end came 82 days after U.S. 10th Army troops 
landed on the main Ryukyu island 350 miles south of 
Japan. Here is the text of Nimitz's special communique: 

' After 82 days fighting, the battle on Okinawa has 
been won. Organized resistance ceased June 20. The 
enemy garrison in two small pockets is being mopped up;" 

★ ★ * 

GUAM — American 10th Army troops Wednesday 
cut remnants of Japanese troops on southern Okinawa 
into three pockets, the largest of which was about 1,200 
yards in diameter, Pacific Fleet headquarters announced 
yesterday. 

$ Remaining enemy target areas 
iy/ I \Y/-II were so sma U that all Ameri- 

W edemeyer yV III can artillery was forced to cease 

. firing because of the danger of 

Shift Headquarters , friendly troops, Fleet 

Admiral Nimitz said. 

This left the task of clean- 
ing up the last pockets of organ- 
ized Jap resistance to infantry- 
men and Marines, supported by 
tanks. Official estimates placed 
enemy casualties on Okinawa at 
89,908, including 87,000 estimat- 
ed dead and 2,565 prisoners. 

More than 850 Japanese had 
surrendered in the past four 
days and correspondents wrote 
that Japanese combat troops 
were giving up in almost unpre- 
cedented numbers on southern 
Okinawa. 

In the Seventh Division area 
alone, 455 Japanese had sur- 
rendered in a single 24-hour pe- 
riod. However, there still was 
savage fighting left to be done. 

Japanese dug into Hill 81 
north of Makabe town — the 
largest pocket left — continued to 
hold out against First Marine 
Division attacks. Late dispatch, 
es said First Marines had 
plunged into the Makabe pocket 
and were fighting for its forti- 
fied positions. Makabe lies 
about 5,000 yards north of the 
island's southern tip. 

First Marine and Seventh In- 
fantry Division forces joined to 
cut off enemy forces on th>e 
Yaeju-Dake escarpment between 
Makabe and Aragachi towns.

gress to consider legislation to 
make the Speaker of the House

for holding such a special elec- 
tion should be provided, now, by 
law," Truman said.

lay in heaps. Among them, lie said, were girls in uniform

gress In a message yesterday to pass the necessary 
legislation authorizing the Judge Advocate of the 
Philippine Army and provincial fiscals to dis- 
tribute compensation and allowances due Filipi-

"Filipinos who were members of the United 
States Army, Philippine Scouts, United States

the War and Navy Departments, and those who 
were employees of other departments of the 
United States Government who were in the

homeland vital sources of oil, rubber, metal and rice. 




NATURE OF THE E N E M Y — Explosives in hand, U. S. lOtl 
Army soldiers approach caves on Okinaiva preparing to fora 
out dug-in Japs. This type of terrain and fighting ivas typica 
of the last ivdeks of the 82-day-old campaign to clear the Jap 
anese from this keystone base.

ighting which preceded fall of Okinaiva to share rations with

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIF, 
— Broadcasting from Guam, 
Lowell Thomas, American 
Hmvs commentatorj said that 
on the very day Gen. Mac- 
Arthur and President Osmena 
entered Manila, plans and 
drawings for the rebuilding 
of the city were ready. 

The plans, he said, were 
made by Americans impri- 
eoned in Santo Tomas. 



Thomas added that "President 
Osmena told me that they 
.are working on a plan for 
transferring some people from 
the more densely populated 
islands to the great southern 
island of Mindanao, much of 
which remains to he opened 
up and developed but first has 
to he explored." 

* * * 

President Osmena, he said, 



believes synthetic rubber will 
make it "too hazardous to 
plant raw rubber in the 
islands." 

* * * 
Thomas visited General 
Walter Krueger, who re- 
viewed the Pacific war and 
"explained strategy and the 
way the Japanese were fooled 
time and again* The most rev 
markable thing is that never 



once, from the time MacArthur 
starts north from Australia, 

did the JaP an « e ^ n /„IiJ; 
£>ry. In the end they fought 
like demons and it was tough 
goin<? for our men." 

General Krueger believed 
New Guinea was the most dit- . 
ficult place in the world to 
fight a war. He said it had 
the worst climate, the deepest 



and densest j\ 
biggest bugs. 

Krueger told

Truman Saves 2 Nazi Spies 
From Hanging/ Given Life 

WASHINGTON— President Truman has commuted 
to life imprisonment the death sentences of William 
Curtiss Colepaugh and Eric Gimp©l, who were convicted 
last February of spying, the War Department announced 
Sunday. 

Colepaugh, an American citizen, and Gimpel were 
landed from a German submarine at Frenchman's Bay, 
Maine, on the night of November 29, 1944 and were 

^captured shortly thereafter. 

They were tried by a seven- 
man military commission at 
Governor's Island, N.Y., charged 
with being Nazi spies, and were 



Conference Aides 
Lauded by Chiefs 

SAN FRANCISCO — Four 
world conference presidents ap- 
peared at special session in the 
San Francisco Opera House 
Sunday to thank members of 
the international secretariat for 
their help. 

Secretary of State Stettinius, 
V. K. Wellington Koo of China, 
A. A. Gromsky of Russia, and 
Lord Halifax of Great Britain 
spoke briefly to sailors, soldiers, 
Wacs, Red Cross workers, 
stenographers, messengers, 
translators, drivers, guards, and 
nurses in praise of their assis- 
tance during the conference 
which was scheduled to close 
Tuesday evening. 4 



Geiger Commands 
Pacific Marines 

WASHINGTON— Gen. A. A. 
Vandegrift, commandant of the 
U S Marine Corps, Saturday 
appointed Lt. Can. Roy S Gei- 
ger commanding general of the 
Pacific Fleet Marine force. 

Geiger, veteran commander 
of Pacific amphibious cam- 
naitms, succeeded Lt. Gen. Hol- 
land M. Smith, who will lead 
the Marine training and u- 
placement command in 
Diego, California. 



sentenced to be hanged, 

The President's announcement 
said he had acted upon recom- 
mendation of the Secretary of 
War and Judge Advocate Gen- 
eral. 

The President's action fol- 
lowed the last war's precedent 
of President Wilson, who, after 
armistice, commuted the death 
sentence of a German spy. 

During active warfare, spying 
is punished as a military pre- 
ventive measure and many spies 
already have been executed by 
American forces in both the 
European and Pacific theaters. 

The War Department said: 
"The reduction of the sentences 
in the case of the two German 
spies establishes no precedents 
where hostilities continue, as in 
the Japanese theater where num- 
bers of spies have been captured 
by Gen. MacArthur's forces and 
executed." 



ATTORNEYS ORGANIZE 

Manila attorneys last Satur- 
day afternoon in the office of 
Atty. Diosdado Macapagal or- 
ganized the Philippine Lawyers' 
Association. Macapagal was 
°lected acting president with 
n j l^rtolome Viola as acting sec- 
1 retary. 



Far Eastern U. 
Delays Start 

At a recent meeting of board 
of trustees of Far Eastern 
University, it was decided to 
postpone reopening of classes as 
buildings were still in used by 
service units of the United 
States Army. 

President F. Dalupan an- 
nounced, however, that if cir- 
cumstances would permit, 
classes at the university would 
begin with the second semester 
of the present school year. 

In the meantime, the adminis- 
tration was reconstructing 
academic records and library 
which had been extensively 
damaged when Japanese oc- 
cupied the premises during the 
past three years. Temporary 
offices of the university are lo- 
cated at 670 Tanduay, Manila. 



Army to Terminate 
Relief in September 

WASHINGTON — The War 
Department Saturday said that 
the United States army expects 
to terminate its civilian relief 
in the Philippines by Septem- 
ber 1. 

A Philippine government re- 
lief authority spokesman de- 
clared that a "good" increase in 
civilian supplies to be sent by 
the U. S. could be expected 
shortly, since the War Shipping 
Administration had allotted 
10,000 tons of shipping, monthly, 
for relief in the islands. 

Testimony before the Hdnse 
appropriations committee re- 
vealed the Army believes that 
the Philippine government and 
appropriate U.S. civilian agen- 
cies have now progressed suf- 
ficiently with their plans.

S.F- 



AN FRANCISCO— Delegates from 50 united nations at t e ? d "}? a ft of the 
ed Nations conference yesterday studied a tentative mcompie ^ d es( jay to 
world charter which in final form will be signed Tuesday and vv«u 
start the ball rolling toward the objective of a permanent world P e • tab _ 

^> A 10,000-word paper 
lished the world security orga^^ 
ization in which aJJ .P» 
nations and. their s^lhtes m y 

participate in a g^^Seace 
Maintain pe^ 
and security. J- ne v« f ~ a ch 
distributed to members of eacn 
delegation Sunday. 

The charter is the result of 
P ii»ht weeks of intensive woiK 
Sf clnSiSe and before r con- 

the address by President Tru 
man. 

The charter provides for a 
general assembly of all nations 
and a security council of 11 
members. 

The "Big Five"— the United 
States, Great Britain, Russia, 
China and France— have per- 
manent seats on the council. 
There will also be an 18 
nations economic and social 
council, an international trus- 
teeship council, a new inter- 
national court of justice to 
replace the one established 
by the defunct League of 
Nations, and various subor- 
dinate organs, including a 
secretariat. 

The charter provides that 
some of the basic causes of war 
shall be eliminated through the 
economic and social council, 
which is dedicated to increas- 
ing the international standard 
of living and to safeguarding 
human rights. 

There is provision for the 
use of armed force, if necessary, 
to break aggression. 

The teeth in this section 
establishes an international 
air force and provides that 
military agreement r hall be 
negotiated between its mem- 
bers and the organization for 
allocation of troops. 

The charter notes that if the 
organization is to avoicl war, 
peaceful methods of settling in- 
ternational disputes are pri- 
mary factors to that end. 

It is stated that the security 
council is empowered to make 
recommendations for a settle- 
ment before resorting to sanc- 
tions or force. 

Legal disputes are to be 
settled by the international 
court, although it is optional 
whether the United Nations 
members will agree to accept 
its jurisdiction.

Denies 

LONDON — William Joyce, 
''Lord Haw Haw/' who 
mouthed anti -British propa- 
ganda for Hitler from Berlin 
during: the war, yesterday en- 
tered a plea of innocent to 
British charges of high trea- 
son, indicating: that he would 
Ijase his defense on a claim 
of American birth. 

Preliminary hearings on the 
charges were adjourned until 

Friday. . , , 

The prosecution contended 
that Joyce had declared him- 
self a British subject by birth 
when he applied for a pass- 
port in 1933 and also on two 
other occasions when seeking 
passport renewals- 

Soon after his capture, fol- 
lowing Germany's surrender, 
Joyce said he was born in 
Brooklyn, N. Y- 



up scattered enemy points of

mosa and the Pescadores de- 
stroyed three coastal freighters, 
nine small craft and damaged 
the wharf facilities at Suo Har- 
bor on the northeast coast and 
strafed railroad depots, freight 
and tank cars from Karenko to 
Taito, 

On the Asiatic coast, patrol 
bombers attacked enemy sea 
lanes, river and overland routes 
of communication, leaving a 
freighter afire off Hongkong. 

The bombers sank two cargo 
boats in the Yangtze, near 
Shanghai, and bombed the 
Canton river front, damaging 
vehicles, railroad bridges and 
rolling stock between Saigon 
and Hainan.

neo and the western Celebes 
dropped over 2&0 tons on 
enemy bases bordering Makas- 
sar Strait. Airfields were crat- 
ered and supply and personnel 
areas were hit, 

Air patrols destroyed a cargo 
vessel and shipyard facilities at 
Kuching. 



GUAM— Almost 500 Super Fortresses unloaded 
l over 3,000 tons of high explosives on 10 Japanese air- 
1 craft and ordnance plants at noon yesterday in the 
biggest B-29 demolition attack since start of the air 
campaign to level the enemy's war machine. 

Army Mustang fighters based on Iwo Jima escorted 
[the armada from the Marianas, The giant bombers, 
Nfc, at [attacking from medium altitude, scored direct hits on 

^factories at Nagoya } Osaka, 
Akashi and Gifu. Clouds 
obscured bombing of some 
objectives, 

A brief communique 
from 20th Air Force head- 
quarters in Washington 
gave no details, other than 
to disclose that the five- 
target assault was made in 
"very great strength.' 7 

AH the factories hit yes- 
terday had been previously 
damaged. Six of them were 
engaged directly in aircraft 
production while four pro- 
duced guns and ammuni- 
tion. 

Among the targets hit were 
the Chigusa factory, Atsuta 
factory, Nippon vehicle com- 
pany, Sumitomo mill, and the 
Aichi aircraft works at Nagoya;

pany^ Kagamigahara plant and

plant near Gifu; the Osaka plant

Elizalde Rope 
Plant Rushes 
Vital Product 

Rope making in the 91- 
year-old Elizalde Rope 
Factory was officially re- 
inaugurated last Saturday 
in the presence of high 
American military author- 
ities and ranking officials 
of the Philippine Com* 
mon wealth. Unofficially, 
the factory had been in 
operation since June 4, 

Resumption of production in 
this rope making plant was 
made possible by the Procure- 
ment division, Headquarters, 
Philippine Base Section and 
Commander Charles Parsons of 
the XL S. Navy who extended 
facilities and materials to re- 
habilitate the factory. The U. S. 
Navy also contributed to open- 
ing of the plant by rushing 
hemp to Manila on PT boats to 
feed the rope machines. 

The Elizalde Rope Factory 
under normal conditions pro- 
duced 7,000 tons of rope yearly, 
>f all sizes and descriptions for 
all kinds of industrial, com- 
mercial and maritime uses. 

The firm was founded in 1854 
when, with a few employes, it 
began making ropes by hand in 
commercial quantities. Later it 
expanded sufficiently to supply 
part of world rope demands.

Ratification of treaties re- 
quires affirmative votes from 
twq-thirds of the senators pre-

pens that all 96 senators are

—only eight more than the

Some of the warmest ad- 
vocates of American participa- 
tion in the international organ- 
ization wanted to take full ad- 
vantage of the momentum built 
up at San Francisco, hoping to 
rush the resolution through the 
Senate,

yesterday requested a neutral

the Levant. 

The request was made in a

Crimes Probe 

LONDON— Russia, reversing 
its previous stand, has decided 
to send two representatives to 
London for a conference on the 
trials of major war criminals, 
a British foreign office spokes- 
man yesterday said. 

Russia, Britain, France and 
thfi U. S. will discuss procedure 
and set dates for the trials of 
Nazi Field Marshal Hermann 
Goering, former German for- 
eign minister Joachim Von Rib 
bentrop, Rudolph Hess and 100 
or more other high Nazis. 

Behind the Russian decision 
was the fact that all main Nazi 
leaders are in American or 
British hands, dispatches point- 
ed out. 





House Extends 
Life of OPA 

WASHINGTON— The House 
□f Representatives gave the Of- 
fice of Price Administration 
another year of life Monday, but 
before doing so it voted to 
transfer absolute control of all 
agricultural' products to the 
Secretary of Agriculture. 

In a hectic session which saw 
Republicans chanting "We want 
meat!/' the House worked over- 
time on a bill which Democrats 
said would give the secretary of 
agriculture power to veto the 
President on food orders. 

Foreseeing possible opposition 
to the bill, the House already has 
named its representatives for 
the conference committee of the 
two houses. 

Republican sponsored amend- 
ments going into the final bill 
included! 

All government orders on food 
would be subject to approval" bv

Slaughtering restrictions on 
local independent plants would 
be removed when the plants 
were judged to be in "a sanitary

agriculture.

nearly 500 Super Forts 
which struck 10 key Jap- 
anese plane, gun and am-

the Japanese homeland. 

More than 70 B-29's 
made emergency landings 
on Iwo Jima on their return 
from the attack. 

Weather was so thick over the 
Japanese metal works at Osaka 
that airmen reported they could 
"actually hear bombs explode" 
but could not see the flames in 
the factory area. 

Crewmen in other planes told 
of barely missing head-on col- 
lisions with Jap fighter planes. 

Clearer skies were enqountered 
over the Mitsubishi 'aircraft 
plant at Kagamigahara. An aft 
gunner reported Super .Forts 
"made good hits on the target 
and fires were burning freely 
all around down there." About 
50 Jap fighters appeared but 
were not aggressive. 

Most bombers returning to Iw/) 
were in need of gas, and a few 
limped in with engines and con 
trols shot away. 

The B-29's landed on Iwo at

seconds.

Jap Chief, Aide Commit 
Hara-Kiri on Okinawa 

OKINAWA — The bodies of Okinawa's Japanese 
commander in chief, Lt. Gen. Mitsuru Ushijima, and 
his chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Lsama Cho, have been posi- 
tively identified after being found in shallow rock 
graves, it was announced yesterday by Col. Cecil W. 
Ness, a U. S. 24th Army Corps staff officer. They 
both had committed hara-kiri. 

Both Ushijima and Cho wore full field uniforms 
with medals and the insignia of ran k pinned on the ir 

blouses. 

A prisoner of war, who had 
been Ushijima's cook, told the 
story of the joint suicide. He 
said an elaborate dinner had 
been served before both Jap 
generals followed the ceremo- 
nial procedure and took their 
lives at dawn last Friday. At 
that moment their last strong- 
hold cave headquarters on Ma- 
duni had been surrounded by 
Americans. 

Okinawa was the only Pacific 
war battleground on which 
both opposing ground generals 
died. 

U. S. Lt. Gen. Simon Boli- 
var Buckner, Jr., last week was 
killed in action while observ- 
ing progress of his troops on 
Okinawa. 

During the second week of 



June, Japanese Admiral Mino- 
ru Ota, commander of all the 
enemy naval forces, also took 
his life when cornered in a cave 
I on Oroku peninsula south of 
Naha city. 

Proposes Division 
Of Large Holdings 

With a view to settling agra- 
rian problems, Rep. Emilio de 
la Paz introduced an Act yes- 
terday authorizing the subdivi- 
sion of big landholdings. 

The proposed law authorizes 
the purchase, expropriation and 
lease of land for subdivision to 
be sold at cost price to occu- 
pants, so that field workers 
may have a share in the land 
they till.

Ateneo de Manila 
Abandons Classes 

The Ateneo de Manila will 
be unable to open classes this 
scholastic year, it has been of- 
fipially announced by Rev. Fr. 
Austin V. Dov/d, S. J ., principal 
of Ateneo High School. 

Plans to open at least high 
school classes were abandoned 
for failure to obtain the neces- 
sary buiiding facilities. At the 
outbreak of the Pacific war, the 
Ateneo had been in continuous 
operation for 28 years. It ceased 
functioning during the occupa- 
tion and several Professors 
were imprisoned by the Jap- 
anese Military ^lice. At one 
time the dungeons of Fort San- 
tiago housed six American and 
two Filipino Jesuits for dump- 
ing ROTC bayonets into the 

P Al! buHdings of the Ateneo 
on its six-hectare campus on 
Padre Faura were destroyed m 
{he battle of Manila The audi- 
torium libraries and laborato- 
-H arid the Jesuit-owned 
Manila Observatory which the 
order ran for the government 
were razed.

Filipinos j'U 
Japs in Laguna 

Three Japanese who had been 
concealed by Makapilis in Ca- 
buyao, Laguna province, were 
shot dead in Talim Island last 
Saturday, according to Jesse 
Bello, Manila newspaperman. 
Bello said there were four Japs 
and a Makapili guide who ar- 
rived in Talim on a small banca. 
After landirg, they headed 
straight for the hills. 

An islander who spotted them 
reported the matter to a U. S. 
Army Laguna de Bay patrol. 
Subsequently several inhabi- 
tants pursued the Japs with 
arms provided by the Army and 
succeeded in killing three of 
them in their hideout. The 
other Jap and the Makapili 
were still unaccounted for. 



Okinawa Japs Take 
No U. S. Prisoners 

OKINAWA — The Japanese 
apparently took no prisoners on 
Okinawa. 

Many Americans listed as 
missing in action could have 
fallen alive into enemy hands. 
Yet American troops said a 
careful search of captured 
enemy garrisons, aid stations 
and hospitals, revealed no trace 
of them, frontline correspon- 
dents reported yesterday. 

Army authorities disclosed 
that they had not been notified 
by the Japanese of any Ameri- 
can prisoners of war. 

Only conclusions reached were 
that Americans, finding them- 
selves surrounded by the Japs, 
preferred to fight to the death 
or Japs abandoned all pre- 
tense of civilized warfare and 
killed all of them they could. 



here yesterday. 

Montgomery said: l '\Ve were 
finished and you came along and 
gave us a helping hand. That 
was the only thing that saved 
the British. But after that, vic- 
tory for us was certain. It is a 
tremendous debt that we can 
never repay. Not ever." 

Montgomery paid generous 
tribute to the courage of U. S. 

fighting men. He said since the 
days of Africa and Sicily he 
hnd worked hand in glove with 
Gen. Omar N. Bradley and with 
thousands of U. S. officers. 

The field marshal added, "I 
want to thank your army and 
division commanders and also 
to pay tribute to men of the 
American army. They have 
been magnificent. The British 
working with you from first 
hand experience know this is 
so." 

Montgomery's remarks 
climaxed a ceremony in which 
100 U. S. officers and enlisted 
men received British decora- 
tions from the field marshal.

Japs Massacre 
Own Wounded 

U. S. Army officers re- 
vealed yesterday that 82,- 
012 wounded Japanese sol- 
diers in the Philippine i 
fighting were ordered kill- j 
ed by their officers, ac- 
cording to an official an- 
nouncement here. 

The U. S. Army officers 
reached this conclusion 
from an examination of 
documents captured from 
the Japs. 

One order, written by a 
Japanese tank comman- 
der, read: "Concerning: 
those wounded: Men who 
are slightly wounded will 
participate in this battle. 
When men wounded are 
not able to participate in 
the battle, their unit lead- 
ers will see to it that they 
end their lives."

Antipolo Now 
Being Rebuilt 

Antipolo, most famous pil- 
grimage center in Luzon for its 
Our Lady of Peace and Good 
Voyage, is now being* rebuilt by 
the inhabitants. Antipolo was 
azed during the fierce encoun- 
ter between the American forces 
and the Japs who had en- 
trenched themselves in the ad- 
jacent hills. 

The ancient Antipolo Church 
which was destroyed is being 
reconstructed. Public schools 
have been opened in tents pro- 
vided by the U. S. Army. The 
famous Virgin is temporarily 
kept at the Quiapo Church in 
Manila pending the construction 
of the Antipolo Church. 



Strafing Planes 
Kill 1,000 Japs 

FIFTH AIR FORCE 
HEADQUARTERS, PHILIP- 
PINES— One thousand Japs 
were found dead in the Baluci 
River valley on Luzon, Sat- 
urday, the great majority 
from aerial bombardment and 
strafing by Fifth Air Force 
fighter planes. ■ 

The information was re- 
vealed in a message of com- 
mendation from the regimen- 
tal commander of the 130th 
Infantry, 33rd Division, to 
Brig. Gen. Frederic H. Smith, 
chief of the Fifth AAF Fight- 
er Command. 

In addition, the 130th re- 
giment accounted for more 
than 400 enemy dead in a 
record 11-day advance, in 
which only one American 
was killed in action. 



Conference Spikes 
French Syria Plea 

SAN FRANCISCO— France's 
request for action by the United 
Nations to investigate Franco- 
Syrian troubles was turned 
down Tuesday with the expla- 
nation the United Nations con- 
ference was not yet ready to 
attack such problems. 

Chief of the French delega- 
tion to the conference had pre- 
sented to Secretary of State, 
Edward R. Stettinius, a sugges- 
tion that the executive com- 
mittee of the United Nations 
appoint a commission of repre- 
sentatives of three countries to 
make the investigation. 

Hollywood to Film 
Life of Jose Rizal 

Authorization to make a mo- 
tion picture of the life of Jose 
Rizal was granted Sam Feld- 
man, Hollywood producer, by 
Trinidad Rizal, sister of the 
hero, it was revealed at the 
Department of Interior yester- 
day. 

Feldman cabled Secretary 
Tomas Confesor a week ago, 
requesting him to get a signed 
authorization from some living 
relative of Rizal for the pro- 
jected picture. Filming of the 
hero's life was ready waiting 
only for authorization. 



Truman Calls 

(Continued from Front Pago) 

made up of delegates with many 
different views. Like this char- 
ter, our constitution came from 
a free and sometimes bitter ex- 
change of conflicting opinions. 
When it was adopted, no one 
regarded it as a perfect docu- 
ment. But it grew and expand- 
ed. And upon it there was built 
a bigger, a better, more perfect 
union." 

The President said that the 
"faith and hope of 50 peaceful 
nations were laid before this 
world forum. Differences were 
overcome. This charter was not 
the work of any single nation 
or group of nations, large or 
small. It was the result of a 
spirit of give and take, of toler- 
ance for the views and interests 
of others." 

"It was proof," he said, 
"that nations, like men, can 
state their differences, can 
face them, and then can find 
common ground on which to 
stand." 

Truman declared the united 
spirit of the Allied nations had 
solved difficult problems during 
the war, "united strength forced 
Germany to surrender and unit- 
ed strength will force Japan to 
surrender." 

He pointed out "a just and 
lasting peace cannot be attain- 
ed by diplomatic agreement 
alone," and said the "charter 
recognizes this fact for it has 
provided for economic and so- 
cial cooperation as well," add- 
ing: 

"Experience has shown how 
deeply the seeds of war are 
planted by economic rivalry 
and by social injustice." 

Declaring "artificial and un- 
economic trade barriers should 
be removed," so "standard of 
living of as many people as 
possible throughout the world 
may be raised," Truman em- 
phasized "under this document 
we have good reason to expect 
the framing of an international 
bill of rights." 

The President warned "forces 
of reaction and tyranny all over 
the world will try to keep the 
United Nations from remaining 
united. But I know I speak for 
every one of you when I say 
the United Nations will remain 
united. They will not be divid- 
ed by propaganda either before 
the Japanese surrender or after 
it."

asked you to continue at your

the last preparations — to act as

"The charter of the United

He said he had ten forced 
by the Japanese to join their 
army and was on a mission to 
Zentsuji camp when he witnessed 
the massacre. 

He attributed it chiefly to 
shortage of food, hut also to 
provide practice for Japanese 
army recruits. At that time 
there was a shortage of food not 
only for prisoners but also for 
the army and the general public. 
The Japanese picked sick prison- 
ers for bayonet drill 

About 220 Japanese soldiers 
participated in the bayoneting 
he said. They were divided into 
three groups, each of *ttch was 
allotted about 50 prisoners. The 
prisoner of war caajp was lo- 
cated about seveji miles from 
Zentsuji town* so no civilians 
witnessed the executions. Other 
prisoners, however, «aw the 
whole thing. 

The Japanese, he said, tied 
each prisoner to a wooden cross, 
and the Japanese major in 
charge made a speech, telling 
the victims: "You are all Chris- 
tians and it will be glory for 
ypu to die in the 5ffii e TOV as 
Jesus. Cft'nst As Jesus Chris! 
had resurrection in three daysj 
you certainly win have one 
also," 

The major then ordered his 
soldiers to attack* The Korean 
said the Japanese were inex- 
perienced and "shivered" so they 
could not wield their bayonets 
effectively, They were seldom 
able to kill a man v.ith one 
stroke. He said .the slaughter 
continued until r> p, m , that" day,

Osmena Calls Abad Santos 
Outstanding Filipino Hero 

'The late Secretary Jose Abad Santos will go 
clown in history as one of the most outstanding heroes 
of this war," President Osmena told a Free Philip-

Abad Santos was Secretary of Justice in Presi-

companied President Quezon in Corregidor, visited 
the irontlmes of Eataan several times with then Vice 

President Osmena and traveled 3> ^

When the presidential pai'ty

mer lord mayor of Thorens, was 
shot to death, yesterday, by 
three unidentified assailants as 
policemen were escorting him

Wing One sank a small tanker, 
a small cargo ship, an uniden- 
tified vessel,- four small craft 
and a freighter off Korea and 
in the Empire waters. A smaU 
freighter transport, five small 
cargo ships, a small coastal car-

3,000 Tons 
Are Unloaded 
In New Blow 

GUAM — Between 450 
and 500 Super Fortress 
bombers from the Maria- 
nas yesterday dropped 
3,000 tons of firebombs 
before dawn yesterday on 
four Japanese industrial 
centers, 21st Bomber Coifc- 
mand headquarters an- 
nounced last night. 

Targets included the seaport 
cities of Sasebo, Moji and No- 
beoka on Kyushu and the ma- 
nufacturing center of Okayarha 
on Honshu. 

The B-29's flew over Japan 
at altitudes of 15,000 to 18,000 
feet without fighter escort 
Complete details were unavail- 
able, but returning pilots re- 
ported large fires at Nobeoka, 
the Portland cement and chem- 
ical city on Kyushu and at the 
industrial city of Okayama on 
Honshu. One Super Fort failed 
to return. 

Sasebo, site of one of Japan's 
most important naval bases, 
was one of the first Jaoanese 
cities to be raided by E-29's 
some months ago. 

The city of Moji is the south- 
em terminus of the Shimone- 
seki tunnel. 

Yesterday's str ike marked the 
11th major assault on Japan 
this month, and raised total 
tonnage of bombs dropped on 
Japanese industrial targets in 
June by Super Fortresses to 
well over 32,000 tons 
record.

Iked for their native

j a and Ne B w Guinea, 
* enlisted" men and 
the regiment were 
to receive special 
: Alamo Scouts and 
^issance battalions, 
*t&t counter- intel- 
f in civil affairs. 
Ies e men were oper- 
1 guerrillas or en- 
fronage. 

Dr * landed with the 
Soaps at Leyte on 



October 20, setting up civil af- 
fairs units in liberated towns. 
Decorations for gallantry in 
battle were numerous, and not 
a few of these former members 
of the First Filipino Infantry 
were killed and wounded in 
action, 

The men of the original re- 
giment landed on February 
7 th at Taclohan, provincial 
capital of Leyte. After a staff- 
ing period they moved to Sa- 
mar Island, where they final- 
ly got what they wanted — a 
crack at the Japs. 

For a time they worked 
with units of the famed 
America! Division, which 
later left them on their own. 
They took over the mopping 
up of Samar with a will, and 
ill 2 J months killed 4S0 Japs, 
losing only 13 of their own 
men. 

The regiment relieved the 
108th Regimental Combat Team 
on Leyte, on May 9th. The 
108th was then engaged in eli- 
minating the remnants of the 
huge garrison that had made 
the Battle of Leyte one of the 
bloodiest of the Pacific war. 
Taking over the job, the Fil- 
Americans began working on 
the Japs in the Villaba-Palom- 
pon area of northern Leyte, and 
proved their mettle as hard-hit- 
ting American doughfeet. 

For two months the First and 
Second Battalions of the regi- 
ment killed more than 40 Japs 
a day and captured 32 more. 
Attesting to the skill with 
,which they out-maneuvered 
the desperate enemy, the First 
lost just two men to enemy 
action during the period. 

Col. Robert H. Offley, a gra- 
duate of the United States Mil- 
itary Academy is regimental 
commander of the unit. Col. 
OfTley's father was the first 
military governor of Mindoro 
and the colonel has aslo served 
previously in the Philippines.

Advocates U. 5. 
Retain String 
Of Isle Bases 

HONOLULU-Retention 

of an extensive string of 
Pacific Island bases in the 
interest of America's fu- 
ture security was advocat- 
ed Thursday by Gen. IL H. 
Arnold, chief of the U. S. 
Army Air Forces, at a 
press conference here. 

Arnold emphasized: "Our air 
power must be in a position to 
carry our attacks home to the 
heart of any aggressor who may 
threaten us. Our own B-29's 
already can strike anywhere in 
the world if we keep the use of 
certain strategic bases," 

He cited as essential for our 
security the bloodily won is- 
lands of the Marshall^ Paulaus, 
Volcanoes, Bonins and the 
Ryukyus, as well as unrestrict- 
ed use of Wake, Canton, 
Palmyra, Christmas Islands, 
and American Samoa, 

I wo Jim a, he said, has al- 
ready saved us 1,100 Super 
Fortresses which have made 
emergency landings there and 
has demonstrated the impor- 
tance of American possession of 
such bases.

Army Plans to Hurl 1 50 Million 
Fire Bombs Against Jap Centers 



WASHINGTON — Approxi- 
mately 150,000,000 incendiary 
bombs for use against Japan's 
industrial centers will be sup- 
plied by the Army's Chemical 
Warfare Service during the 
next twelve months, the War 
Department announced yester- 
day. 

It meant that CWS, which 
furnished nearly 160,000 tons 
of fire bombs for all opera- 
tions throughout the globe in 
the past six months, will 
double that figure in the next 
six mouths, and almost triple 



it for the first half of 1946- 

In terms of tonnage, num- 
ber of incendiary projectiles 
booked for Japan next year 
amounted to approximately 
850,000 tons. This was about 
80 percent of tonnage of all 
air bomb types used by Army 
air forces in all theaters last 
year. 

Success of chemical mortar 
battalions in all combat areas 
had resulted Sn demand for 
more of thofi* supporting units 
as well as increase in number 
of white phosphorus and high 
explosive shells now fired bv 



the famous 4.2-inch rifled 
chemical mortars (goon guns) 
in amphibious as well as land 
operations. 

Present production of shells 
for this weapfn is 25 percent 
over that of a corresponding 
period last year. New mortar 
battalions were scheduled for 
activation rapidly as possible. 

Portable and tank mounted 
f amc throwers and new type 
flame throwers used to rout 
Japanese from holdout nosN 
tions will be produced in in- 
creased quantities, the War 
Department said.

Mitscher*s Flagship Carrier, 
Smashed at Okinawa, Survives 
And Makes Port on Own Power 

WASHINGTON— Blasted, set ablaze and knocked 
out of action off Okinawa when two Jap suicide planes 
scored two direct bomb hits on the morning of May 
11th, the U. S, aircraft carrier Bunker Hill survived 
and will fight again, the Navy Department announced 
Thursday. 

The heroic 27,000-ton warship came home from 
Okinawa under her own power for repairs in the 
Bremerton, Washington, Pujjet Sound navy yard. 

The carrier was flagship of Vice-Admiral Marc 
A. Mitscher's Task Force 58. Mitscher narrowly 
escaped death when a 500-pound enemy bomb ex- 
ploded within 20 feet of the 'flag: plot" in the car- 
rier's island superstructure, killing three officers and 
11 men of the admiral's personal staff. 

A daring piece of seamanship 
by the Bunker Hill's skipper, 
Capt. George A. Seitz, literally 
flung fire from her hangar, 
hurled tons of flaming gasoline 
and water overboard and forced 
billowing smoke away from the 
ship. 

Seitz ordered a 70-degree 
turn which shifted the load of 
water being poured on flames 
to the side and then into the 

sea. 

For 58 days and nights, the 
Bunker Hill sent her planes 
smashing- against Japanese 
strongholds of Iwo Jima, 
Tokyo, in the Inland Sea, 
Kyushu, and Okinawa. Then, 
as the big* ship was support- 
ing- ground forces on Okina- 
wa, two Jap planes sneaked 
in to drop bombs which set 
the carrier ablaze, 

The cruiser Wilkesbarre 
pushed her bow against the 
carrier's starboard quarter, and 
while her hoses fought flames, 
men who had been trapped in 
the hangar deck leaped aboard 
her to safety* 

The destroyers, S'tembel, 
Charles S. Sperry and the 
English stood alongside and 
shot water into the flames* 
Seriously wounded from the 
Bunker Hill were evacuated to 
the Wilkesbarre, which re- 
mained along side during the 
dramatic turn which climaxed 
the fight to save the carrier. 

Biggest fires were brought 
tinder control after six hours 
had elapsed but smaller ones 
burned throughout the night. 
The Bunker Hil! joined the 
Pacific Fleet in the fall of 
1943. Her battle scars marked 
her as the most extensively 
damaged ship ever to enter 
the Bremerton Navy Yard* 



British Unveil New 
Stratosphere Plane 

LONDON — A new twin- 
engined stratosphere fighter 
plane called the "Welkin," said 
to be the largest of single 
seater fighters, was announced 
Thursday by the British Min- 
istry of Aircraft Production. 

The Welkin has a wing 
spread of 70 feet.

Red Cross Lauds 
U. S- Care of 
Prisoners Here 

MANILA — J- O. Bessmer, 
recently re-appointed official 
International Red Cross repres- 
entative in the Philippines, 
yesterday described as ^excel- 
lent" the provisions for shelter, 
food, and general cleanliness of 
prisoner-of-war, enemy alien 
and collaborators' camps in the 
Manila area. 

He made the statement after 
a day's visit to New Bilibid 
Prison and the Welfareville 
Camp for women and children, 
both for enemy aliens and col- 
laborators, Bessmer, first 
named international represent- 
ative during the Japanese oc- 
cupation, was re-appointed by 
Geneva with the approval of 
the U. S, State' Department. 

His visit to the camps grew 
out of a request from the Pro- 
vost Marshal General's office 
that the American Red Cross 
ffirnish certain clothing items 
and recreational material to the 
Welfareville camp. Bessmer was 
accompanied on the inspection 
trip by C. Leo Wilhelm of 
Columbus, Ohio, now acting 
manager of the Philippine Red 
Cross, 

"Actually any statement I 
make about conditions in these 
camps is entirely unofficial at 
present," Bessmer said. "I visit- 
ed them at the request of the 
£ OVos L, M arshal General's 
office. While I will report to 
^reneya on conditions as I saw 
them any inspection of mine 
would have to be initiated from

time friend, as vice presidential 
candidate at the Democratic 
convention in Chicago. Byrnes 
had spent most of his career in 
public service as senator from 
South Carolina. He served in 
the House of Representatives 
from 1910 to 1924 and in the 
Senate from 1930 to 1941, when 
the late President Roosevelt ap- 
pointed him associate justice of 
the United States Supreme 
Court. 

In 1942 Roosevelt asked him 
to become director of the Eco- 
nom ic Mobilization Board. 
Byrnes then moved his office 
to the White House. In this 
capacity he had the final word 
concerning prices, wages, rents, 
fuel and manpower utilization. 
He supervised rationing, froze 
workers in their jobs, and is- 
sued orders affecting everyone 
in the nation. 

He resigned this post shortly 
before V-day. 

Long a student of interna- 
tional affairs, Byrnes accompa- 
nied Roosevelt to Yalta confer- 
ence last year. After Truman 
became president, Byrnes con-

2 Hours, Mac Arthur Says 

Australian Seventh Division troops, in their 
third major landing on Borneo, stormed ashore at 
Balikpapan early Sunday morning and secured 
"a firm beachhead," General MacArthur an- 
nounced today. Allied losses were described 
officially as "very light." 

Striking directly for the famed oil center, a 
major source of fuel oil and aviation gasoline for 
the Ja panese, the first Australian troops went 
ashore at 8:55 a.m. Successive waves followed 
on schedule, and by 10:30, they had won a one- 
mile strip of beach from one-quarter to one-half 
mile inland — their first objective. 

General MacArthur in command landed with the last 
wave of assault troops. His first words upon touching 
the shore were : 

think today we settled the score of the Makassar 
Strait affair of three and a half years ago." He 
referred to the dashing attack made by four United 
States destroyers on January 22 to 24, 1942 through the 
Makassar Straits in an attempt to block the passage of 
huge Japanese convoys steaming down through the 
straits. 

The landing area was subjected to the longest period 
of softening up sea bombardment ever recorded in the 
Southwest Pacific. Since June 15 U.S. 'Seventh Fleet 
and Royal Australian and Dutch warships stood offshore 
and rained explosives on the area of small villages select- 
ed as the landing place. Since the first of June units 
from the Fifth and 13th U.S. air forces, and the RAAF 
dropped 3,500 tons of bombs on the Balikpapan area 
of which 150 tons were fire bombs. 

Immediately preceding the landing, 150- Allied 
planes swoop low over the beachhead and demolished 
oil storage tanks surrounding Balikpapan, effectively 
thwarting any Japanese attempt to flood the beachhead 
area with flaming oil as a counter-defensive measure.

U.S. Treasury Impounds 
Stolen Tabacalera Bonds 

\ f 

The Philippine Office of Foreign Funds Control, 
U. S. Treasury department, announced Saturday it 
had impounded $20,000 worth of securities which 
were reported to have been stolen from the safe of 
Tabacalera, outstanding Spanish concern, in Februa- 
ry, 1945. 

The securities would be held 
until such time as the true 
owners were able to substan- 
tiate their claims, I. G. Alk, 
head of the P. I. office, said. 

Treasury officials warned 
holders of looted securities 
they would not be able to dis- 



pose of those securities or send 
them out of the Philippines 
without treasury license, and 
treasury license would not be 
issued unless the holder of se- 
curities was able to satisfacto- 
rily establish chain of owner- 
ship since the beginning 
Japanese occupation

Resp^itaility for compliance 
will rest with owners and man! 
agers, Col J. r Holland, pro- 
vost marshal, declared 

Regardless of how Army 
property was obtained, all res 
taurante, night clubs and other 
places ot entertainment using 
such supplies as canned goods 
sugar, butter, milk, Coleman 
lanterns, generators or Army 
furniture, will be closed and 
"never allowed to reopen to 
United States troops/' the pro- 
vost marshal warned. 

He explained if an estab- 
lishment is placed "Off Limits* ' 
and opens in the future under 
the same ownership or man- 
agement, it automatically will 
be banned from patronage by 
military personnel. 

The provost marshal said 
white sugar, canned milk and 
preserved butter are "practi- 
cally unobtainable except from 
U.S. Army stocks directly or 
indirectly," Any quantities of 
these items found on the pre- 
mises, he added, "will be 
deemed to be in violation of 
the ab*ve regulations/' 

"From now on it will mean 
business disaster to all places 
having United States Army 
property," the provost marshal 
said. 

The "Off Limits" bureau of 
the Police Department revealed 
there were now 139 establish- 
ments ''Off Limits" in Manila 
because of illegal possession of 
goods, sanitation, failure of 
night club waitresses and host- 
esses to appear for examina- 
tions, violation of curfew re- 
gulations and disorderly con- 
duct

Pravda Backs 
United Nations 

MOSCOW — The Soviet news- 
paper Pravda Friday backed 
up the United Nations charter 
signed at San Francisco saying: 
"The Soviet people have 
shown time and again that they 
cannot only defend their own 
country with arms, sparing 
neither effort nor even life it- 
self, but similarly that they 
are also prepared to utilize all 
their strength, all the might 
of their vast lands to create, 
in joint efforts with other na- 
tions, a stable organization of 
peace." 

The Russian-controlled Berlin 
radio, under the heading "What 
We Must Know/' devoted ^an 
entire broadcast to a description 
of the United Nations charter, 
The broadcast said "it is the 
aim of the charter to save the 
world from another war and it 
wants to help all nations as 
good neighbors in peace, tole- 
rance and freedom."

THE MACAKI'HUR STAMP 

The latest landing on Borneo by Australian troops under 
General MacArthur's command has accomplished three main 
objectives: 

j — It splits the rich Indies treasure chest in two. 

2 — It enables Allies shipping to cover any point in the 
Southwest Pacific under a protective umbrella of friendly air 
power. 

3— It completes Allied tactical control of the entire South- 
west Pacific area. 

Aside from these strategic considerations, this third landing 
on Borneo bore all the usual characteristics of the now famous 
amphibious product known to the trade as "Made by Mac- 
Arthur." . , 

As usual, the Jap wasn't in the right place. As usual he 
was caught off guard. As usual he was snowed under by 
superior land and sea oower. The landing went off like clock- 
work, with the first objective seized within the initial three 
hours. ... . 

Most importantly, there was the usual characteristic that is 
perhaps the most outstanding of all— "our losses have been very 
ligh t." .

Survey Shows U. S. 
Health Improving 

WASHINGTON — Surveys 
covering 44 years showed health 
conditions have greatly im- 
proved in the United States, the 
Bureau of Census announced 
yesterday. 

Compiled from 1900 through 
1943, charts showed pneumonia 
and influenza deaths reached 
202 for each 100,000 population 
and was the leading cause of 
death in 1900. 

But by 1902 this disease was 
in fifth place, dropping to 55 
per 100,000. In 1943, however, 
the death rate rose to 67 per 
100,000 because of widespread 
epidemics.

MACKINAC ISLAND, MICH. 
—President Truman Saturday 
urged America's governors, the 
majority of whom were attend- 
ing the annual governors con- 
ference here, to lend their lead- 
ership to the twin tasks of 
forcing Japan to surrender un- 
conditionally and - building 
world security. 

In a telegram to Utah Gov. 
Herbert B. Maw, chairman of 
the conference, Truman ex- 
plained he was unable to attend 
because of "official duties" and 
declared "this year, the gover- 
nors conference faces a two- 
fold responsibility — lending all 
possible assistance to task of 
forcing unconditional surrender 
of our remaining enemy, Japan, 
and aiding our country to plan 
for the orderly transition of 

peace and security " 

After citing numerous domes- 
tic problems with which gov- 
ernors conference must deal 
Truman added: 

"Permit me to direct your at- 
tention to the most pressing 
problem facing all of us today: 
"The task of building world 
security which we have just 
undertaken." The prosperity of 
our states is due in large meas- 
ure to energies of peoples 
who came or whose ancestors 
came from all countries of the 
world. This fact should alone 
make us see far better in this 
country than any other, we are 
truly a part of the free com- 
monwealth of nations. 

"War has touched each state, 
each .territory: it has cost us 
the lives of many men who 
have become leaders in their 
communities. Upon those re- 
I maining, especially upon the 
elected chief executives of 
popular government, there rests 
the responsibility of assuming a 
position of leadership at home, 
heightened by awareness of 
United States leadership among 
nations. As we stand on the 
threshold of our most ambitious 
effort to avoid future wars and 
guarantee lasting peace and 
prosperity, let each among us 
prayerfully shoulder the bur- 
dens not only of a leader of his 
community but of a citizen of 
the world."

repqrt Sunday to President 
Truman furnished a long 
list of social benefits spon- 
sored by the American gov- 
ernment since she took oi-

vantages through the creation ot 
a free public employment serv- 
ices and the establishment ot a 
national policy encouraging col- 
lective bargaining and assuring 
workers the full right of associa- 
tion and self organization. 

She emphasized that workers 
were permitted to designate re- 
presentatives of their own for 
negotiating terms of employ- 
ment or mutual protection.

pointed out, were also given 
authority to negotiate minimum

To Move 50,000 
By Air Per Month 

NEW YORK — Planes flying 
the Atlantic at the rate of one 
every six minutes will bring 
back as many as 50,000 troops 
monthly from Europe when re- 
deployment reaches its peak in 
July, Col. Eugene Gillespie, com- 
manding officer of the Air 
Transport Command in New

pleted 27,000 crossings of the 
Atlantic with only 10 fatalities.

"WIN OR DIE" 

Japanese militarists are getting increasingly desperate for 
means to whip up enthusiasm among their people for continuing 
what is obviously a hopeless war. Nov/ Japanese are being told 
their only choke is to "win or die." 

The Japanese people were not too enthusiastic about going 
to war at the outset. They did not feel particularly menaced 
by America . The bulk of them were at best, indifferent, Japan's 
militarists had to channel this Indifference Into active hate. 

Hitler's device was to picturing a helpless Germany threat- 
ened by an unholy alliance of bomb-throwing agitators and 
grasping foreign capitalists. The Japanese decided to make it 
a racial war. Americans were portrayed as brutal, degenerate, 
obsessed with the idea of exterminating the Japanese people or 
reducing them to slavery- The story that Americans flatten 
Japanese prisoners with steam rollers has become legendary in 
the Japanese army's enlisted ranks. 

America 1 !; policy toward the Orient is too well known in 
the Philippines to need embellishment here. President Truman, 
and before him, President Roosevelt, have made clear what we 
are fighting for. 

The Japanese people are not faced with the choice of 
"victory or extermination." After the war is over and Japan 
has been cleansed of the militaristic ideas which have poisoned 
her national existence, she will take her place again among a 
community of nations* 

The real enemy of the Japanese people today is not America, 
but their own leaders, who, by prolonging the war, are exposing 
Japan to destruction unparalleled in history. 

Direct Aid for Filipino 
Insurance Firms Sought 

President Osmena in a special message to Congress 
yesterday recommended adoption of an amendment to 
the Insurance Law granting power to the Insurance 
Commissioner, with court approval, to take charge of 
impaired companies in an effort to solve their dif- 
ficulties, 



The President explained busi- 
ness cannot be carried on ef- 
fectively unless banking facili- 
ties are available and insurance 
companies are in operation. 

Mauvo Mendez, undersecreta- 
ry of Information, revealed the 
proposed legislation was pre- 
pared by the insurance commis- 
sioner and the adviser to the 
president on insurance, and fol- 
lows in a general way the liqui- 
dation statute of New York and 
several other states. 

He said "the law is necessary 
because local Philippine compa- 
nies have serious difficulties to 
overcome caused by the upheav- 
al of the war, the payment of 
obligations due the companies 
with Japanese military currency, 
and the impairment, of other as- 
sets by destruction in Manila 
and other parts of the Philip- 
pines/' 

Meudcz added: "Many of the 
local companies are faced with 
a serious situation caused by cir- 
cumstances beyond their con- 
trol," 

Mai aca ft nn's spokesman ex- 
plained that if the proposed le- 
gislation is s adopted tbe Insur 
ance Commissioner may petition 
the Courts for permission to 
take over an impaired company 
or one whose operation is 
deemed hazardous to the public. 



NO DESKS 

One of the biggest worries 
of city school authorities inci- 
dent to the opening of schools 
last Monday was the question 
of providing school children 
with desks. Manila's school 
children who flocked, to the few 
city schools which opened this 
week found that they had to 
either sit or squat on the bare 
floor for lack of desks.

Vatican Bombed by Fascist 
Plane in '43, Aide Reveals 

HOME — Vatican City was deliberately bombed 
November 5, 1943, by a "twin-engined Italian Fascist 
plane in conjunction with German SS troops," Gerold 
Tittman, assistant to the U. S. Vatican representative 
Myron Taylor, said Mon day, according to a press 

^dispatch. 

Tittman said: "It was not 
unusual for a plane to fly over 
Vatican City and none of us 
ever dreamed anyone would at- 
tempt to bomb us. But that 
mght a plane flew low and 
dropped bombs slowly and de^ 
hberately for 30 minutes. Then 
we heard explosions 

Tittman said he believed the 
plane contained Italian Fascists 
who were disgruntled with the 
Vatican. 

He asserted he knew of no 
reason why Germans should

Only Road to Enduring Peace 

WASHINGTON— President Harry S. Truman ap- 
peared yesterday before the tL S, Senate asking 
"prompt ratification" of the United Nations Charter 
to secure the United States' participation in the world 
security organization. 

The President, who brought the Charter back 
with him from San Francisco after addressing the 
final session of the United Nations conference, pre- 
sented it to Senator Kenneth McKeller, president pro 
tern of the Senate, before addressing the senators, 
= _ - - Truman said: "The choice be- 
fore the Seriate is now clear. 



j Today's Short Story 

Emiterio Valdez, Manila 
oar owner, paid three 
American soldiers P25 in 
exchange for a health cer- 
tificate. They also pro- 
mised to allow him to 
keep his place open until 
1 o'clock in the morning 
notwithstanding the cur- 
few hour of 11 o'clock at 
night All this for P100, 
he reported to the police. 

Advancing P25, Valdes 
promised to pay the rest 
of the money the next day. 
The three American sol- 
diers never returned.

Pacific. 

Richardson said the two com- 
mands were charged with re- 
sponsibility for supply, train- 
ing, and administration of all 
Army troops in the Pacific. 

Richardson said area under 
Middle Pacific command is the 
same that he now has as com- 
manding general of Pacific 
Ocean areas. 

He said there is ' 'greatest 
good will and cooperation 
among services in the Pacific." 

Richardson said he believed 
that Okinawa was the last 
operation where one comman- 
der would be charged with re- 
sponsibility for all phases. 



The choice is not between this 
Charter and something else. It 
is between this Charter and no 
charter at all. 

"This Charter points down 
the only road to enduring 
peace. There is no other," he 
added. 

The President referred to 
congressional action favoring 
an international peace organ- 
ization — the Conn any and Ful- 
bright resolutions, passed by 
the House and Senate, both ad- 
vocating U. S. participation in 
an international organization — 
and stated that peoples of the 
world looked to the Senate to 
lead in approval of the Charter 
and the world court statute. 

Truman said he would not 
go into details of the Charter 
as it would be discussed tho- 
roughly in a Senate debate. He 
outlined the charter's objectives 
as follows: 

"It seeks to prevent future 
wars. 

"It seeks to settle interna- 
tional disputes by peaceful 
means in conformity with the 
principles of justice. 

"It seeks to remove the eco- 
nomic and social- causes of in- 
ternational conflict and unrest," 

In conclusion, Truman em- 
phasized the Charter was not a 
"static treaty" and that "im- 
provements will come in the 
future as the United Nations

An unknown American sol-

the police reported yesterday.. 

Preliminary investigation dis- 
closed a bruise at the back side

Dewey described the world

He praised the work at the

Mission Accomplished 

EDITORIAL 



When Japan struck out boldly on December 8, 1941, in her 
plan to conquer the world, there was one, primary objective— 
fhe Philippines. For this strategically-placed set of islands, as 
the world later found out, key&toned the entire Japanese cam- 
oaicm of expansion. 

Without the Philippines, there would have been no Greater 
P s f Asia co-prosperity sphere. The Japanese would not have 
t^en able to fan out into the Indies, to engulf Singapore and 
Malaya, to pierce nearly to Australia's back door, 

p rom the Philippines, Japan could dominate aH the ap- 
aches to her stolen empire. Behind the Philippines, her ship- 
P - r ^ fr rt m small luggers to majestic passenger liners, could range 
pi m;& from tie Bay of Bengal to the Kuriles.

"This is just the start," 
General Kenney said, "The

General MacArthur's com- 
munique revealed this morning 
that Allied air forces under his 
command during June sank or 
severely damaged 164,800 tons 
of enemy shipping, destroyed 45 
enemy planes, flew 21,435 sor- 
ties, and dropped more than 
18,500 tons' of bombs in sup- 
port of ground operations, 
lie also tabulated results for 
the first six months of this 
year at 2,282.000 tons of ship- , 
pinjsr sunk or severely dam- 
aged, 1,265 planes destroyed, 
135,062 sorties flown, and 
over 85,000 tons of bombs 
dropped. 
Operations, he said covered a 
vast triangle from Nanking to 
Java and the Solomon islands. 

In ground action, General 
MacArthur announced the cap- 
ture of the Manggar airstrip, 13 
miles east of Balikpapan by 
Australian 7th Division troops, 
against slight opposition. 

Both runways of the airstrip 
were found to be unserviceable 
because of recent Allied bomb- 
ings. Other Australian forces 
pushed inland four miles and 
penetrated the enemy defenses 
in the Panda nsari Oil Refinery 
area. In the Brunei Bay area 
Australian 9th Division patrols 
captured an enemy ammunition 
dump east of Mirh 

On Luzon, Philippine Army 
forces which took Fadian Wed-

exactly i — -utes <->i ni 

pines meant. ...... . j.l 

1— The enemy's c^ter was pierced, dividing Japan to the 
north and her captured Pacific islands to the south, enab mg 
American forces to envelop and attack each portion at will. 

2— It gave America a gre at land, sea and air base tor tu- 
ture operations against the Japanese Empire; a base of opera- 
tions which General MacArthur compared in value to the British 
Islands in the campaign against Germany. „ 

3— It enabled American sea and air power to establish a 
great strangulating ai r an d sea blockade" between Japan and 
her possessions, preventing either supplies from reaching the 
homeland, or reinforcom en ts from reaching the battlefronts. 

4— It punctured Japan's Greater East Asia balloon, and 
reintroduced democracy in the Far East. _ 

5— It liberated captured American soldiers and civilian 
internees. 

6 — It culminated a series of "crippling" blows to the Jap- 
anese Army, Navy a n d Air Force, including the destruction of 
at least 23 divisions a n d close to 450,000 men. 

From the day Arr, er i C an troops landed on Leyte nine months 
ago, the Jap was outfought and out-thought. Deploying only 
17 divisions against Yamashita's 23, General MacArthur bested 
the boasting conquor 0r of Singapore in every skirmish, in every 
baffle, on every island. Yamashita squandered the lives of over 
400,000 crack Japan ese troops. In sharp contrast, American 
losses were H.92I ki|| e d, 401 missing, and 42,569 wounded. 

The Philippines campaign certainly is one of the most bril- 
liamiy conducted in American history. It is the story of a 
champion "who camo back."

sey It ended in naval disaster 
for Japan which lost nearly ^ 60 
warships sunk or damaged. 
Japanese warships and auffl 
liaries which were not sunk . m 
Leyte Gulf and Surigao Strait 
fled westward, in badly dam- 
aged condition. 

The landing in October was 
made possible largely due to 
preliminary heavy air bom- 
bardment of the enemy s air- 
fields on Mindanao and in tne 
Visayas for a full two months 
prior to the invasion. Destruc- 
tion and neutralization of tne 
Japanese air strength in tne 
central Philippines prevented 
the enemy from engaging m 
full scale air counter-attacks. 
Intimately related with the air 
attacks by the air forces of the 
Southwest Pacific, were strikes 
against Manila and northern 
airfields by carrier planes of the 
Pacific Fleet— an example of 
the practical coordination of 
American forces which charac- 
terized the campaign.

On October 23, at Tacloban, 
on the steps of the provincial 
capitol, was proclaimed return 
of the Commonwealth govern- 
ment, and establishment of its 
temporary seat, under President 
Osmena, at Tacloban. This pro- 
cess reached its high point with 
General MacArthur's formal 
turning over of the government 
of the Philippines to President 
Osmena in Manila on February 
26. 

By December 26, General 
MacArthur was able to an- 
nounce the end of the Leyte 
campaign. The Japanese lost 
over 200,000 men in their at- 
tempt to "drive us into the sea" 
as Yamashita phrased it.

southward. This callous cruelty, 
and violation of principles of 
decency, without basis in mil- 
itary necessity delayed the libe- 
ration of Manila, but did not 
hinder our advance. 

While the Battle of Manila 
was going on, the 38th Division 
landed at Bataan itself, gaining 
for itself the distinction of 
avengers of that battlefield. 
Two -days later, paratroopers 
and infantry joined forces to 
recapture Corregidor. Thus, 
Bataan and Corregidor, the 
two symbols of American and 
Filipino sacrifice, were once 
more in American hands, and 
General MacArthur visited the 
Rock in person, to see for him- 
self the raising of the Ameri- 
can flag.

On March 1, the first -Ameri-

Harbor. The end of the battle 
of Manila marked the end of

Osmefia on Liberation [ 

President Osmena today issued the following state- 
ment on the occasion of complete liberation of the 
Philippines : 

"The complete liberation of the Philippines, as an- 
nounced by General Mac Arthur, fills every Filipino heart 
with supreme satisfaction. No event since the memorable 
day the American forces landed in Leyte can match the 
significance of this liberation, not only for us, but also 
for the other peoples who- are still in the grip of the 
treacherous enemy. 

"The Philippines as a powerful base of American 
operations places the same forces that have treed us 
practically at the doorsteps of Japan From our direc- 
tion the decisive blow will be dealt-the blow that will 
make it impossible for the Japanese to repeat the atroci- 
ties inflicted on peace-loving peoples. 

*'At the same time the complete liberation of the 
Philippines presages the return of normal «v;l condi- 
fions ana the fuU enjoyment byj ^of our constituhonal 
rights and prerogatives. <$>- 

"To America and, in particu- 
lar, to General MacArthur goes 
our heartfelt gratitude for the 
permanent liquidation of the 
Japanese menace and the assur- 
ance of peace, security and iree- 
dom for th e people of this 
country.*' _

Japs Repeat 
Atrocities in 
Borneo Areas 

WITH ALLIED FORCES 
NEAR BALIKPAPAN — The 
burning alive of starving wo- 
men and sick Japanese, Java- 
nese and slave laborers in a 
Borneo hospital was charged 
against the Japanese army 
Wednesday by Netherlands offi- 
cials, a press dispatch said. 

Japanese officials, it was 
charged, set fire to the hospital 
before driving all able bodied 
persons northward in the direc- 
tion of the Samarinda oil fields. 
Several thousands, including 
Javanese and Borneo Dyaks, 
were believed to have been 
driven away for slave labor 
purposes. 

Only 200 civilians, including 
two women, have been found so 
far in this area. Nearly all are 
pathetically beaten skeletons. 

Pedestrian Traffic 
Shows Improvement 

The pedestrian traffic cam- 
paign which was inaugurated 
last Saturday was described by 
high traffic officials of the po- 
lice traffic division as "fairly 
successful." 

Notwithstanding the repeat- 
ed warnings made before the 
beginning of the educational 
drive, civilian pedestrians per- 
sist in walking with their backs 
toward traffic, while others, in- 
cluding military pedestrians, 
walk on streets even when there 
are sidewalks. 

Eight arrests were made 
since Saturday in connection 
with the pedestrian traffic 
campaign. Charges for viola- 
tion of traffic regulations and 
disobedience to police officers 
were included.

blackened, empty shells or ugly

would be less appalling if they 
were torn down and there were 
open spaces instead of awful 
reminders of edifices. 

"When I was forced to leave 
Berlin, the German army had 
just won a crushing military 
victory over France. Berliners, 
then, either arrogantly or com- 
placently, were making light of 
the first British air raid which 
had resulted in very minor 
damage in one of the suburbs. 

"England, like France, would 
soon be defeated, Berliners said, 
boasting that last minute at- 
tempts by the British to attack 
Berlin from the air could have 
no serious effect on them. 
"Now, the Berlin people are 
thinner and shabbier and 
they move dully through the 
ruins of Berlin, meekness 
and defeat in their faces. 

"I came into Berlin with* 
American occupation troops 
from the southwest, through, 
the residential half of the sub- ; 
urb of Zehlendorf. Zehlendorf 
is not badly hit. Behind its tree- 
lined sidewalks, one out of five 
or ten houses may be an empty 
shell. The rest stand intact, 
with more scars than are 
imaginable. 

"We drove up through the 
fashionable district of Wil- 
mersdorf. Here there are 
modern apartment houses, 
many of them built during 
the brief period of prosperity / 
in the late twenties. Here, 
the proportion of damage in- 
creases, although it is still no 
worse than in many another 
German city. v 

"But on the Kurfuersten dam 
it is just one blackened skeleton 
of buildings after another. 

"Along the whole ^ avenue 
there is only one moving pic- 
ture theater open and* one cafe 
where people are incongrously 
sitting and sipping some substi- 
tute for coffee or poor grade 
cognac. 

"Tiergarten is lined with 
leafless trees and the strewn 
debris of burned out buildings. 
"The government district 
is about as badly damaged as 
any. We walked down the 
Leipziger strasse past the 
huge Awag department store, 
whose frame still stands out 
and whose anterior is a mass 
of twisted girders and debris. 
Across the street, Goering's 
air ministry has fared some- 
what less badly. 

"Hitler's old chancellery and 
Dr. Paul Goebbels' propaganda 
ministry are completely down. 
The new chancellery still 
stands. 

"At Pariser Platz, there are 
still structures of a kind that 
are vaguely reminiscent of the 
American embassy and the 
Adlon hotel but the French 
embassy across the square is 
largely gone."

This was the first aerial strike by General MacArthur's sup-

great ability and integrity but 
also a deep sense of loyalty to

this war, so victoriously ended 
in Europe and so successfully 
waged in the Far East

Isolated Bulacan Barrios 
Greet Liberators First Time 

Four months after American troops liberated 
Bulacan province, 40 minutes drive by jeep from 
Manila, a twin barrio of 1,000 inhabitants in Bulacan 
met and talked with the first Americans only last 
Sunday. 

Peacefully isolated at the southernmost tip of 
Hagonoy and detached from the town proper by a 
spider-web of winding rivers and streams, the barrios 
of Pugad and Tibagin learned early on February that 
MacArthur and his forces had returned. They had 
watched American planes flying low and at least two or 
three issued of Manila newspapers reached the place, but 
they had not yet seen a "liberator*' in person. 

Last Sunday, Paul Tredway 
and Vernon Bank of the CIC, 
accompanied by the Mayor of 
Hagonoy, a former guerrilla 
leader, motored to Pugad and 
Tibagin, . Eyeing the visitors 
from a distance, the entire peo- 
ple of the barrios, men, women, 
and children flocked to the river 
bank, clapping their hands and 
shouting "Mabuhay." They al- 
most mobbed the two Americans, 
carried them on their shoulders 
from the boat to the foot of the 
barrio bridge. Everyone hap- 
pily greeted Tredway and Bank 
with "Hello, Joe" and "Hello, 
Buddy/* clasped their hands and 
embraced them. 

The barrio lieutenant ordered 
immediate preparation of a 
feast where all kinds of sea- 
foods were offered to the visit- 
ors. The two Americans re- 
marked that they had not wit- 
nessed since Australia a "down 
to earth democracy in action" 
when the whole barrios joined 
the nublic banquet 

The two young Americana 
left late in the afternoon with- 
out their caps, pipes, handker- 
chiefs and some coins which they 
gave to the children as souvenirs 
of the belated "liberation" of 
Pugad and Tibagin,

Truman Signs 



Reciprocal Act \ m 
Extended for 
3 More Years 

WASHINGTON— 
President Truman yester- 
day signed a three-year 
extension of the Recipro- 
cal Trade Act which 
grants him authority to 
cut U. S. tariffs up to 50 
percent under the rates 
prevailing January 1, 
1945. 

The new law permits reduc- 
tions of some rates as much as 
70 percent below the rates of 
the Hawley-Smoot law of 1930. 

State Department officials 
said that the president's new 
powers , would permit a return 
to tariff levels of the Under- 
wood Tariff Act of the Wilson 
administration, not item by item 
but on an average basis. 

Under the old Reciprocal 
Trade Act of 1934, the presi- 
dent could cut duties to 50 per- 
cent below the Hawley-Smoot 
rates. Under the new law, on 
items already reduced 50 per- 
cent, the president may now 
reduce them 75 percent under 
the Hawley-Smoot rates. 

However, state department 
officials said that reductions 
would be made on a selective 
basis to expand world trade. 

Extension of the Reciprocal 
Trade Act was recommended by 
the late President Roosevelt 
shortly before his death. Dur- 
ing the congressional discus- 
i sion of the bill, President Tru- 
man sent a letter to Congress, 
stating that the new tariff cut- 
ting power was necessary to the 
success of his administration. 
Truman declared that addi- 
tional power was needed in 
conjunction with the Bretton 
Woods world monetary plan 
to build a sound economic 
foundation for world peace. 
House and Senate passed the 
bill in June. 
The reciprocal trade program, 
in which other nations agree to 
lower trade barriers in ex- 
change for U. S. tariff cuts, was 
largely promoted during the 
State secretaryship of Cordell 
Hull. 

During the last 11 years 
under the tariff reduction 
scheme agreements have been 
negotiated with 28 nations.

with 

everything from tiny fighters to giant B-29's on Friday 
and Saturday, as the tempo of the all-out aerial cam- 
paign approached round-the-clock attacks. 

The 21st Bomber Command revealed yesterday, fol- 
lowing the attack of 600 Super Forts on five Honshu in- 
dustrial cities, that damage done by B-29's to Japanese 
Homeland industrial areas now covered an area more 
than 126 square miles. 

In their latest strike, the B-29's dropped 4,000 tons 
of incendiary and demolition bombs over 275 miles of 
Honshu hitting Kofu, Chiba, Shimizu, Shimotsu and 
Akashi. Their principal targets were oil refineries, 
aluminum plants, railway centers and aircraft plants* 

Latest reconnaissance photos 
showed Jive additional, square 
miles burned out in five major 
Japanese home cities. In ac- 
counting for new damage in- 
flicted since June I Oth, the tolly 
showed: L3G square miles de- 
stroyed at Himeji; 1.5 square 
miles at Kure; .42 square mile 
at Ube on Honshu; .8 square 
mile at Kumamoto on Kyushu; 
.32 square mile at Kochi on 
Shikoku. The 12G square miles 
of damaged area were distri- 
buted over 25 Japanese indus- 
trial cities, it was stated by Air 
Force Headquarters here. 

The IL S, 21st Bomber Com- 
mand Headquarters also dis- 
closed reconnaissance planes 
were roaming almost at will 
over Japan's homeland. New 
targets are revealed by these 
daily missions and reconnais- 
sance is said to be so effective 
that Japan's war production can 
be virtually counted on a daily 
basis. 

Yesterday,- Admiral Nimitz 
announced Liberators and 
Privateer planes of FJeet Air 
Wing 18 sank 16,300 tans of 
Japanese shipping during' June 
anil damaged another 11,150 
tons. Earlier in the week, 
Nimitz announced that Fleet 
Air Wing One, also based on 
Okinawa, sank 137,875 tons of 
enemy shipping and damaged 
138,400 Ions. 

On Okinawa, Navy Privateer 
pilots, in reporting damage in- 
flicted on their first strike 
against Korea, yesterday stated 
that they wrecked seven trains, 
six bridges, three tunnels and 
many railway installations 
along the rail lines leading to 
Manchuria.

WASHINGTON — The Juno

it accounted for a four percent 
total over the scheduled produc-

proving so effective in the war

that aircraft production was 
slightly under goals for some 
other types, primarily in patrol

A UKtAM IS UbAD 

Eight years ago, confident Japanese armies embarked on 
a grandiose dream — the conquest of China. It began modestly 
enough with the first open clash of arms — provoked by the Jap- 
anese — at Marco Polo bridge in Peiping. 

Thus began the Sino-Japanese war. Japanese troops, fresh 
from their quick conquest of Korea and Manchuria, fanned out 
over the length and breadth of China. They expected the job 
would take 90 days. 

Today, more than 2,900 days have slipped by since that 
memorable July 8, 1937. Although Japan has won many bat- 
tles in China, has stolen her ports, her textiles, her rice, her 
metals, her coal; has slaughtered or starved millions of Chinese 
people, victory has still eluded the warlords of Tokyo. 

In China, the armies of Japan have spent heavily in men 
and materiel in these past eight years, but their dream of con- 
quering China and harnessing her manpower for a Pan-Asiatic 
war against the Occidental world is still just that — a dream. 

Japan, as her fallen partner in Europe can testify, made 
the mistake of trying to engulf a large land mass with inferior 
manpower. Hitler's legions won many battles in the great land 
spaces of Russia. But in the final analysis, it was the Russians 
who gained victory. Thus is history being repeated in China, 
where Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's armies have valiantly 
been trading space for time in eight long years of losing battles. 

Today, time is running out, not for China, but for Japan. 
Her armies still face an unfinished campaign on the mainland 
of Asia, against a people who recoiled just as violently as Fifi- 
pinos against Japanese professions of friendship and Japanese 
ideology. 

At home, her leaders are feverishly trying to rouse Japan's 
population for a last stand on the beaches of the sacred home- 
land, for the American invasion that is sure to come. 

Japan, unlike China, has run out of space to trade. And 
time can mean only one thing — unconditional surrender.

first air borne cross line land- 
ings late in March of -this year.

These civilians had been told^ 
they would be killed and tor 



tured by the Americans. They 
were threatened with severe 
punishment if they read Ameri- 
can surrender leaflets. 

"I think there will be many 
suicides among the Japanese in 
the hills/ 7 said Maeda Shono- 
suke, a former school teacher 
at Calinan. 

"Will it be from love of the 
Emperor or from fear?" asked 
an interpreter. 

"Fear," she replied without 
hesitation. 

Thus the teacher vividly de- 
scribed the desperation of many 
thousands of Japanese who 
have been taken from their 
homes, denied news of outside 
events, and forced to support 
the last-ditch defense of Jap- 
anese forces in this onetime 
center of Nipponese influence 
and population in the Philip- 
pines. 

He did not know. Okinawa or 
Iwo Jima had been captured, 
although enemy troops here 
have been fairly well supplied 
with details of the war's pro- 
gress. He did not know that 
Tokyo had been bombed. 

Middle-aged Shizue Matsu- 
mati bowed politely as she 
coughed into her trembling 
hand. 

"We do not want to fight," 
she said. "We want to give up." 
She held her hands aloft in ges- 
ture of surrender. 

Another woman, Higa Yosu, 
?aid she had found Japanese 
troops considerate of civilians, 
in some respects. But the 
troops had forced many civi- 
lians to labor for them, fed 
them little or nothing, and had 
taken some women into their 
camps as "comfort girls." She 
said her two sisters had been 
taken into the Jap camps. 

Sgt. Alfred Culber, who re- 
ceived the latest prisoners, re- 
ported the civilians were not 
diseased, although tired and un- 
dernourished. Only one child, 
with sores on his legs, appeared, 
at the first sick call. 

Lt. Robert E. Lee, who has 
charge of the interment camp, 
said he is preparing to accom- 
modate 5,000. The number of 
civilians taken, he said, is ex- 
pected to increase sharply as 
the Japs are forced further 
hack into the hills. 

The civilians, he said, will 
operate their own camp on a 
communal basis. At the out- 
break of the war, it has been 
estimated there were 19,000 
Japanese civilians in the Davao 
area.

ports of threats against North 
American correspondents for 
articles criticizing the Farrell^

El Diario, according to a news 
agency, said Braden told Vice 
President Juan Peron last Tues- 
day that he was "speaking in 
the name of the government of 
the people of the United States. 

"The Argentine government 
might take whatever measures 
it deemed convenient with Ar-

U it decided to attack the in- 
tegrity of the freedom of North 
American correspondents it 
would have to abide by the con*

as saying. 



The Chamber of Commerce of 
the Philippines has asked Mala, 
caftan for a statement of policy 
with respect to real estate trans- 
act inns effected during' Jap- 
anese occupation. s 

This action was prompted by 
reports to the chamber that the

the U* S, a total of 340,000 
soldiers ' have arrived from 
Europe and Atlantic bases. 

Discussing the Philippines

portant resistance in the Philip- 
pines had now been overcome 
with the complete liberation of 
the islands.

HONOLULU — Lt Gen. Koy S. Geiger, new 
commanding general of the IL S* Marines in the 
Pacific area, yesterday declared the Japanese home 
islands are wide open for invasion and the United 
States can move in any time. 

Geiger, back from Okinawa/ where he led the

He praised the work of all branches of the 
service in the Okinawa campaign and expressed 
hopes the Marines would participate in the climactic 
battles of the war-

Spy CI ief for LG. Farben 
Seized by Yanks in Germany 

HOESCIIT, GERMANY - The man who headed e*p^ 
Farben Industries was taken into military custody as United f^f Q^ 0 r ga niza- 
effected seizure of management, assets and plants of th ?f a f p d *^ 
tion in the American zone of occupied Germany, Associated fiess w * 
Don Whitehead reported Saturday. pnTltro ] council 

The Espionage leader was identified in United States group control cou 

records as Dr. Max Ilgner, 70 years old, 
and 



Ilgner and Dr. Herman* 
Schmitt, principal director of 
Farben Industries, were being 
held in Frankfurt for question- 
ing about affairs of Farben. 
American control group mem- 
bers have branded German in- 
dustries a "major threat to 
peace and security of the post 
war world." 

The AP correspondent quoted 
Col. Edwin S. Pillsbury, who 
directed seizure of 24 Farben 
plants in the American zone, 
as saying that as head of In- 
dustries Farben's central admi- 
nistration, Ilgner "procured 
foreign currency which the 
Reich required in its espionage 
throughout the world." 

Pillsbury said his office had 
information showing Farben In- j 
dustries, through Ilgner's acti- 
vities, carried on industrial es- 
pionage throughout the world. 
American investigators discov- 
ered Ilgner made many trips to ; 
the Far East, including China j 
and India, in 1934 and 1935, and 
visited South and Central 
American countries later. 

Seizure of the giant plant at 
Hoescht was carried out quietly. 
American guards permitted only | 
a few carefully selected person- I 
nel to enter. * These workers 
will maintain operating effi- 
ciency of plant and produce es- ! 
sential pharmaceutical items 
for the United States Army. 

Byrnes Praises

WASHINGTON — Honoring 
the "unconquerable spirit" of 
China, Secretary of State James 
Byrnes Saturday sent the fol- 
lowing message to Dr. T. V. 
Soong, president of the execu- 
tive Yuan government of the 
republic of China: 

"Today it is a full eight 
years since your country made 
the momentous decision to re- 
sist Japanese aggression. On 
this occasion it is a privilege for 
me to join with other Americans 
in doing honor to the unconquer- 
able spirit of the Chinese peo- 
ple to carry on. 

"In your continuing and con- 
certed efforts we may not only 
accomplish the early defeat of 
the last of the Axis aggressors 
but plso provide effective assur- 
ance that such aggressions can- 
not rise again to scourge man-

Confesor Reviews 
ECA Achievements 

ECA is doing a distinct public 
service and everyone connected 
with the organization should 
feel proud of the service they 
are rendering, declared former 
Secretary of Interior Tomas 
Confesor in a farewell party 
given in his honor last week. 

"The first thing the U. S. 
Army did in Manila after driv- 
ing away the enemy was to 
distribute food to the people 
who were starving and to estab- 
lish hospitals to take care of 
.the sick and wounded." the for- 
mer secretary recalled. When 
the Army had to extend the 
service to other liberated areas, 
the ECA hastily assumed the 
administration of the PCAU 
.units in the city, Confesor said. 
Despite the many difficulties, 
the "ECA has gone ahead with- 
out a break in the distribution 
of relief goods and through its 
various agencies is now feeding 
over a million people daily, 
giving relief to over 50,000 
needy persons, and taking care 
of over 3,000 »sick in refugee 
homes and hospitals."

Historic Congress Address 

General of the Army Douglas MacArthur set him- 
self squarely on record in favor of Philippine indepen- 
dence in a colorful, emotion-packed ceremony in the 
ramshackle bui lding housing the Philippine Congress 

^ yesterday morning. 

With shouts of Mabuhay ring- 
ing in his ears, the General de- 
clared: "Your combat record on 
Bataan and the magnificent 
spiritual and physical resistance 
of the great masses of your peo- 
ple to the enemy efforts at 
pacification has given to the 
world the true strength of your 
character and established your 
undisputed spiritual capacity 
for self-government under any 
standards, H 

The "Idol of the Filipinos," as 
Senate President Manuel Roxas 
named him in introducing the 
General, formally received from 
Speaker Jose C, Zulueta resolu- 
tions making him an honorary 
Filipino citizen and placing his 
name permanently on the rolls 
of the Philippine Army. 

General MacArthur said in 
his 46 years of military serv- 
ice no other honors had 
moved him more deeply. 4, I 
accept them with a full heart 
as a tribute to the historic 
part my country has played 
iri the progress of your peo- 
ple/' he declared. "I accept 
them and throughout life 
shall treasure them in token 
uf the mutual understanding* 
faith, and affection which 
bends us, the one to the 
other." 

In a 15-minute address, the 
General answered every major 
objection to the grant of com- 
plete independence, such as lack 
of racial stature, economic in- 
stability and military un pre- 
paredness* 

"The war has either afforded 
you the opportunity to prove the 
fallacy of such arguments or so

He said he was fully confident 
the American people would ex- 
tend to the Philippines "the full 
measure of trade advocated by

Quezon and do everything else

For his part, General Mac- 
Arthur promised "the Army

"But such assistance is not 
enough/' he stressed, "if it be

The situation, he pointed out, 
demanded an admixture of pa-

THE CASE FOR INDEPENDENCE 

In the halls of Congress yesterday morning, the case for 
Philippine independence was never more clearly championed. 
The speaker was General MacArthur, and his words carried the 
weight of a man who has lived, sacrificed, and fought for the 
liberation of this land. 

He outlined each objection offered by the critics of in- 
dependence, and answered it m bold, ur> mistake able language. 

To those who cried ihe Philippines yet lacked the stature 
as a race essential to self government he told the story of Ba- 
taan, of the sacrifice, the heroism, the fortitude and the resi- 
liency of a people who rose above the horror, starvation and 
destruction of Manila. 

To those who cried the Philippines lacked economic stability 
to sustain self government, General MacArthur expressed con- 
fidence that America will extend full trade to this nation, and 
financial assistance in the critical first years. More than that 
he promised "all aid in reconstruction which the military situa- 
tion will permit/ 1 in addition to help from United States civil 
governmental agencies* 

Finally, to those who cried the Philippines lacked resources 
essential to defend this nation, General MacArthur pointed to 
the world as it will be, not as it was — a world blueprinted by 
the United Nations conference In San Francisco, in which, as 
General MacArthur put it, "Defense is no longer national, It has 
become Internationa L' f 

This then, remains a challenge to the Philippines. For here 
can be fashioned a keystone In the structure of international 
peace. 

It is no secret that Japan, in her victorious hour tried to 
exploit racial differences between the Orient and the Occident- 
Japan carried a message of division and exclusion between the 
East and the West. Fortunately, for the future of all, this cam- 
paign failed. 

So, to the rest of Asia, the Philippines* role, as a workable 
blend of the cultures of East and West, emerges as a beacon 
of hope for those who long for the brotherhood of man. 

As General MacArthur phrased it, "the success of your 
joint venture with America offers the one great hope for peace- 
ful solution to the conflicting problems of the East and the 
West." 

And to keep this beacon of hope aflame, he emphasized 
that the Filipino people themselves must remain united, must 
put aside petty [ealousy and selfish ambition, to 1 'realize the 
vision of the magnificent goal toward which you strive."

Those who would gay th^t, the

When many ? f your cities and towns

ana in want. Thua the burdens upon 
you are heavy. It absolutely essen- 
tial that you operate without undue 
faction. Petty jealousy, seifiah umbi- 
ctori and misundersitandint must not 
be permitted to impedo progress and 
tend your country. The a access of 
your joint venture with America ot- 
ters the one erreut hopq for peaceful 
solution to the conflietfnK problems 
of the EaBt and West. Now mere 
than at any other •time in your his- 
tory you must realise the vision of 
the magnificent soal toward which 
you strive. Only by united action can 
you attain fruition. In every other 
major step in which you have suc- 
ceeded you have done an through the 
strength of unity. Do not fail now. 

To assist you the Army will pro- 
gressively give you all the aid in 
reconstruction which the military sit- 
uation will permit and the appro* 
priate civil agencies of the United 
States will do all that lies within their 
power — - but such assistance is not 
enough if it be without the full sup- 
port and willing toil of your own 
tjeuplc- It is therefore of utmost im- 
portance both in the successful prose- 
cution of the war and the reconstruc- 
tion of your country that this legis- 
lative body in constructive collabora- 
tion with the coordinate branched of 
government — executive and judicial — 
provide the people with a vigorous > 
in-pirinK, impartial and discerning 
leadership on a course realistically 
charted to servo those great national 
purposes. 

In the 46 years of my military ser- 
vice, large parts of which have been 
dedicated to the interest! of the Fili- 
pino people, no honors that I have 
received have moved me more deeply 
than 1 1 a ve th"f;e thh 0'tv:r-.s ha« re-

them with a full heart as a tribute 
to the historic part my country has 
played in the progress of your people. 
I accept them and throughout life shall 
treasure them in token uf the mutual 
understanding, faith, and affection 
which binds us, the one to the other. 

The relations between the American 
and Filipino peoples are sanctified by 
the blood of both nobly and sclilessly 
shed upon Philippine soil. From north 
to south, from east to west, too stark, 
white crosses dot your landscape where 
we laid oar mutual dead to sleep 
forever. Their sacrifice lives as a 
flaming torch to fire the will and 
steel the hearts of free men to resist 
likewise if need be unto death, all 
efforts, however devious the means, 
to compromise that freedom for which 
they died, 

God grant that your people may 
with the same fortitude and determi- 
nation that has permitted them with 
unyielding spirits to r*e ^ove the 
stern realities of the past, face the 
future with Faith ^ 
and unafraid. God ffrant that under

WASHINGTON — President

" radio by its very nature must

The article, celebrating the

operation on a regular schedule, 
added "our lawmakers demon- 
strated an admirable foresight 
by decreeing that America, as 
the birthplace of radio, should 
have a free competitive system, 
unfettered by artificial barriers 
and regulated only as to the 
laws oi nature and the limita- 
tion of abilities. 

"The American system has 
worked and must keep going. 
The regulation by the natural 
forces of competition, even with 
obvious concomitant short- 
comings, is to be preferred over 
the rigid governmental regula- 
tion o£ a medium that, by its 
very nature, must be maintain-

his eyes were moist when he 
c aid i 

"The relations between the 
American and Filipino peoples 
are sanctified by the blood of 
both nobly and selflessly shed 
-upon Philippine soil. From 
north to south, from east to 
west, the stark, white crosses 
dot your landscape where we 
laid our mutual dead to sleep 
forever." 

Punctual to the second, 
General MacArthur, with 
President Sergio Osmena, en- 
tered the hall to a deafening 
burst of applause. There was 
a prolonged ovation when he 
rose to speak and when he 
had finished the applause was 
deafening. 
General MacArthur occupied 
a seat on the rostrum to the 
right of Senator Roxas, while 
President Osmena sat on Speak- 
er Zulueta's left. General Mac- 
Arthur was attended by Brig. 
General L. A. Diller, GHQ 
public relations officer. 

Roxas, introducing General 
MacArthur, said the joint ses- 
sion was in tribute to "one of 
the greatest soldiers of all 
time." 

"During the three and a half 
years of Japanese occupation of 
our country," Roxas declared, 
"this man was the symbol of 
our faith and the source of 
strength of our resistance. 
LEAVES WITH OSMENA 

Speaker Zulueta presented 
General MacArthur with the 
two resolutions printed on 
sheep-skin paper, saying the 
honors bestowed on General 
MacArthur were unprecedented. 

"But eloquent as these docu- 
ments are, they cannot begin 
to fathom the depth of our 
eternal gratitude to General 
MacArthur and to the govern- 
ment and people he represents 
with peculiar honor. That gra- 
titude runs deep. It has forged 
one of {he strongest ties that 
bind us to America and the 
American ideal." 

After his speech, General 
MacArthur descended from 
the dais, locked his left arm 
with President Osmena's 
right, and proceeded to the 
office of the speaker in the 
upstairs portion of the build- ) 
ing where an informal recep- 
tion was held. The General 
was almost mobbed by ad- 
mirers seeking autographs. 
He signed his name good- 
naturedly on P20 Victory 
notes and invitation cards. 
When it began to look the 
task would never end, Sen- 
ator Roxas rescued the Gen- 
eral and ushered him out to 
the front porch where his car 
, was waiting. Admiring crowds 
lined the corridors and shout- 
ed Mabuhay as he passed. 
The crowd on the street, held 
In check by scores of MP's, 
cheered as he appeared and 
the General acknowledged 
their cheers with a wave of 
his hand.

Walker, in his annual report 
yesterday for the fiscal year 
ending June 30, 1944, emphasiz- 
ed problems involved in the 
handling of mail for the Ameri- 
can armed forces. 

"Nothing like it has ever

so successfully in transporting 
these vast quantities of mail." 

Walker said during the fiscal 
year, 1,482,000,000 pieces of 
mail were sent overseas to 
Army personnel. During the 
same period, 'V mail dispatch- 
ed to Navy personnel totaled 
38,000,000 pieces and air mail 
152,282,000. In addition, 272,- 
984,477 other pieces of mail

Civilian War Medal 
Okayed by Truman 

WASHINGTON — President 
Truman Sunday established by 
executive order a civilian award 
for meritorious service since 
Pearl Harbor which have aided 
the war effort to be known as 
the "Medal of Freedom." 

The medal will be awarded 
to U. S. civilians for services 
outside the continental United 
States to persons who aided any 
Allied nation in the fight 
against Fascist aggression. 



The Manila slaughter house is now killing cattle 
for the city beef supply only a little less than durinp 
pre-war times, it was revealed by the Emergency Con- 
trol Administration yesterday. 

The number of cattle slaughtered during June 
was 30 head daily. Since the beginning of July, this 
number has jumped to 65, which is only 35 head less 
than the pre-war daily average of 100 heads.

Norway Formally Declares 
War on Japan as of 1941 

LONDON— Norway is at war with Japan, the Norwe-

broadcast from Oslo. 

The broadcast said n a state of war has existed between 
Norway and Japan since December 7, 1941 but the Norwe- 
gian government has thought it wise to hold back a formal 
announcement until it was once again on its own soil" 

The Norwegian government also made the announce- 
ment Sunday of the appointment of Maj. Gen. Otto Ruge 
as commander-in-chief of the Norwegian armed forces. 

Gen. Ruge led the resistance forces against Germany 
in 1940. Recently released from a prisoner of war camp 
in Germany, he will replace Crown Prince Olav as com- 
mander-in-chief. • .

Smash at Jap 
Capital City 
Still Going On 

G U A M — More than 1,000 
bombers and fighters from the 
powerful U. S- Third Fleet were 
attacking the Tokyo area yes- 
terday morning in the greatest 
display of American aerial 
might against Japan since start 
of the Pacific war, 

The huffc strike, announced 
by Fleet Admiral Chester W, 
Nimitz, caught Japanese de- 
fenders by "complete sur- 
prise/' and was still conti- 
nuing at 8:30 a.m. when yes- 
terday's communique was 
issued. 

Coming as a crescendo to a 
series of devastating Super 
Fortress attacks on the Jap- 
anese capital, yesterday 1 s car- 
rier smash was preceded by 
land-based aerial attacks 
against Kyushu on July 5 and 
again on July 

These included heavy raids

chells and Thunderbolts on 
Omura airfield on the southern-'

ANOiHER SIGNIFICANT CONFERENCE 

President Truman's departure for the forthcoming con- 
ference near Berlin among the leaders of Russia, Great Britain, 
and the United States underlines one of the basic reasons why 
Hitier, Mussolini, and their counterparts in Japan have failed 
in their scheme of world conquest. 

The projected meeting illustrates, willingness of the heads 
of the three most powerful nations in the world to sit down at 
a conference table and work out master plans of operation. It 
is, in itself, one of the most powerful weapons at the United 
Nations command. 

At Casablanca, at Teheran, at Cairo, at Yalta great deci- 
sions were fashioned by the late President Roosevelt, Prime 
Minister Churchill, and Marshal Stalin. Each conference was fol- 
lowed by explosive repercussions on the battlefronts, and on the 
diplomatic scenes. 

The landings :n North Africa, the Russian counter-offensives 
from the Volga, the invasions of Italy and Normandy, and final 
victory in Berlin, all were born at these meetings. The same can 
be said for the Atlantic Charter, the conception of the Four 
Freedoms, and the structure of an international peace organiza- 
tion just completed at San Francisco. 

This next meeting comes at a great and portentuous mo- 
ment in history. Germany has been vanquished by a victorious 
team of American. British, and Russian troops. 

On the other side of the world, Japan is getting her first 
taste of all-out a:r warfare, while American land armies shuttle 
into position for fhe final kill. 

What may follow frpm this conference remains in the realm 
of speculation. As in former meetings among the Big Three, 
this one too may precipitate explosive repercussions on the re- 
maining world battlefront. 

Both the United States and Great Britain^ stand firmly 
pledged to exact unconditional surrender. Russia, while it is 
not at war with Japan, stands united with America and Britain 
in overall objectives of a peaceful world, aligned against Fascist 
aggression. 

Japan has more than good reason to ponder what may be 
discussed at this latest conference. 



8 German Prisoners Slain 
By Berserk U.S. Army Guard 

SALINA, UTAH — Eight German prisoners were 
killed and 20 wounded at the Salina prisoner of war 
camp yesterday by machinegun bullets fired into the 
tents of sleeping prisoners by a berserk U. S. soldier 
guard, Maj. Gen. William G. Shedd, commanding gen- 
eral of the Ninth Service Command, announced. 

.The reason for. the shooting was not determined, 
the general said 



The shots were fired by Pfc. 
Clarence Bertucci, age 23, a 
tower guard who has been held 
for questioning in an investiga- 
tion of the affair. 

"Bertucci apparently went 
berserk and for no apparent 
reason cut loose with a mounted 
machinegun and kept shooting 
until he seemingly ran out of 
ammunition." 

The guard was alone in the 
tower at the time of the firing. 
He calmly surrendered to the 
officer of the day and another 
guard. 

GUINTO RECOMMENDED 

Regino Guinto, brother-in- 
law of the late Congressman 
Wenceslao Q. Vinzons who led 
the resistance movement in the 
Bicol region early during the 
Japanese occupation, has been 
recommended to President Ser- 
gio Osmeria by the Young Phil- 
ippines Party as Governor of 
Camarines Norte. Guinto is at 
present acting Governor of Ca- 
marines Norte, having been ap- 
pointed to the post by the mili- 
tary authorities. 



War on Mosquitoes 

The City Department of 
Health has started an intensive 
mosquito control program, it 
was announced yesterday. 
Every Army installation will be 
sprayed for adult mosquitoes. 
Individual houses also will 
likewise be sprayed. The gen- 
eral public is asked to cooper- 
ate in every way possible to 
make the mosquito control pro- 
gram a success.

Kenney Expects 
More Opposition 

WITH FIFTH AIR FORCE, 
OKINAWA — Gen. George C. 
Kenney, visiting the 35th Fight- 
er Group now based on Okina- 
wa, yesterday told those vete- 
rans of aerial warfare against 
the Japs to expect greater op- 
position now that they were on 
"Japan's door step." 

Gen. Mac Arthur's air chief 
warned fighter group members- 
who have seen action over New 
Guinea, Morotai, and in the 
Philippines — that although thus 
far they have met virtually no 
opposition over Japan, they 
must keep a sharp look out for 
the time when older Jap pilots 
will take up defense of their 
homeland. 

Kenney observed these enemy 
fliers were probably acting as 
instructors. 

EMBASSY WRECKED 

BERLIN— The U. S. Embassy 
in Berlin is a complete sham- 
bles, a press dispatch revealed 
yesterday. The embassy had

British Study Secret Nazi 
Weapons for Use on Japan 

LONDON — Secret German weapons have been 
sent from Lubeck to Britain in the past few days. 
They will be examined by experts for possible use 
against Japan. 

The weapons, sent from North German ports, 
include amphibious vehicles, numerous types of 
planes, including jet craft, some of which never

pens after which the brush was 
set ablaze. . 

She told of one 13-year-old 
French boy who was given re- 
gular injections by Nazi doctors 
to induce goiter and mental de- 
ficiency. The boy became such 
a tragic wreck that his mother 
could not recognize him when 
they were reunited in Paris. 

Mrs. Bobbins quoted the 
French women as charging that 
when the boy fell ill from in- 
jections German doctors stepped 
them up.

U.S. Troops On Okinawa 
Issued Special Yen Notes 

PEARL HARBOR — American troops on Okinawa 
used special currency printed under the supervision of 
the U. S. Treasury department, Commander J. L. Her- 
lihy, supply officer of the Pacific Fleet Service Force 
announced yesterday; 

American troops are forbidden to use U, S. currency 
on Okinawa for two principal reasons, Herlihy said. 
One is to prevent American money from falling into the 
hands of the enemy, and the, other is to prevent more 
than one type of money circulating at the same time. 

The invasion money was^ 5 " 
printed in one, five, ten, twenty 



and 100-yen notes, with ten and 
50-yen notes issued additionally. 
No coins were made. 

American service perSorinel 
draw their pay in supplemental 
yen and spend it through serv- 
ice stores, ican teens, post ex- 
changes and through other 
outlets, 

When leaving Okinawa, the 
money must be exchanged for 
American currency, excepting 
a small amount which may be 
retained as souvenirs,'

Europe Grain 
Outlook Poor, 
Survey Shows 

WASHINGTON — The out- 
look for grain production in 
Europe this year is about the 
poorest of the entire war period 
and wheat prospects are spe- 
cially unfavorable, the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture announced 
Monday. 

A severe drouth in the Medi- 
terranean area reduced seedlings 
in most of the war affected 
areas, lack of fertilizers and 
shortages of machinery and 
transportation facilities were 
mainly responsible for the poor 
outlook, 

Food allocation authorities of 
the agricultural department es- 
timated that 650,000 bushels of 
wheat will have to be sent to 
Europe next year, half from 
the U, S, and half from Ca- 
nada. 

The food officials said land 
reforms mtroduced in Poland, 
the Baltic States} Hungary, and 
other sections of the Balkans, 
Czechoslovakia and eastern 
Germany appear to be havine

WASHINGTON — Another new aerial weapon has been ^1^2^ 
anese-the new Chance Vought F-4 U-4 Corsair, the Navy Department announce* 

The first Japanese airman to get a gl impse of the new P la i^ f ^ 
tell his superiors about it He was shot down in two minutes flat by Marine uorp* 
Lt Douglas M. West off the Japanese island of Am ami Oshima. 

— ■ : — Marine pilots, who were the 

first to fly the new Corsair, de~ 
scribe it as' "one of the most 
powerful, single-seater fighters 
in the world/' 

Capt, Kenneth A. Walsh, 21 
plane Marine ace and holder of 
the Medal of Honor, states that 
the plane is absolutely tops and 
leaves nothing- to be wished for 
in speed, maneuverability and 
performance. 

The plane is a composite im- 
proved model of all the earlier 
Corsairs. Its four-bladed pro- 
peller, driven by a 2,500 horse- 
power engine, measures 13 feet, 
two inches from tip to tip and 
literally "chews holes in the 
sky" in flight. Power can be 
greatly increased by water in- 
jection- / 

The plane is in the 425 miles 
an hour class, has great maneu- 
verability, carries six 60-caliber 
machine guns in the wings and 
has the latest modern push but- 
ton transmitter and receiver 
radio equipment. 

The F-4 U-4 rate of climb has 
been increased by almost 1,000 
feet a minute and its ceiling 
upped sufficiently to hold an 
altitude advantage over high- 
flying land-based Jap aircraft. 
Most of the added weight was I 
transformed into increased 
speed. 

New Corsairs will become an 
important part of the increased 
fighter complement of carriers. 
As bombers, they can carry 
2,000 pounds of bombs or 
■rockets. Freed of this load, 
they can become the Navy's 
fastest fighters* 

The new ships have more than 
3,000 combat hours in their first 
10 days of use by Okinawa- 
based marine pilots in which 
they achieved 271 missions 



Troop Redeployment Already 
2 Divisions Ahead of Quota 

NEW YORK— The U. S. redeployment program 
is two full division^S 0,000 men— ahead of schedule, 
communications zone headquarters in Paris announc- 
ed yesterday. 

By the end of June 396,000 had left Europe for 
the United States, the report said. Of these, 280,000 
embarked when the quota was 250,000, ■ 

The British Broadcasting^ * 

Company reported the "mass 
movement of American planes 
and Airmen from Europe to the 
United States has begun." 
American planes, with their 
crews, were taking off for Mar- 
seilles at close intervals, using 
southern Atlantic routes, as 
north air routes were already 
filled with returning soldiers 
BBC said. 

The July quota of 265,000 
troops to be sent back to the 
United States for discharge or 
further fighting in the Pacific 
probably will be exceeded, 
Army authorities added

these fires caused the releas- 
ed incendiaries later to fly 
back into the bomb bay, rip- 
ping off the door and dam- 



aging the horizontal stabilizer. 
The B-Z9 did a half loop 
and headed again over the 
blazing jetty. 

"Turmoil raged inside the 
plane as loose equipment 
be?an to hit the crew," Lt. 
Richard Basket*, the bombar- 
dier said* 



Incendiaries fell out of the 
bomb bay again without do- 
ing any major damage to the 
place, which flew upside 
down for several seconds 
until the pilot brought it 
under control and back on its 
course for a safe return to

Kenney Reveals 
Plans to Speed 
Okinawa Bases 

FAR EAST AIR 
FORCES, PHILIPPINES 
— "As soon as we are in 
position we will attack 
Japan from 10,000 feet 
and from 10 feet with fire 
and explosives, with 
bombers and fighters — 
and we'll do it 24 hours a 
day/' yesterday declared 
Gen. George C. Kenney, 
commenting on the assign- 
ment of the Seventh Air 
Force on Okinawa to his 
Far East Air Forces com- 
mand. Kenney added: 

"With the addition of the 
Seventh AAF to the Far East 
Air Forces, we are rapidly 
moving into position to cover 
the air over Japan from our 
Okinawa bases. As the air arm 
of Gen, MacArthur's forces, we 
have now joined together the 
Central Pacific and the south- 
west Pacific air theaters. 

"The Seventh has come from 
the east/' Kenney said, and 
"the Fifth has come from the 
South and the 13th has come 
from the southeast. Okinawa is 
a long way from Hawaii and 
from Port Moresby and from 
the Solomons but we have 
learned something with every 
move. 

The Seventh Air Force, com- 
manded by Brig. Gen. Thomas 
D. White, is already represented 
on Okinawa with B-24 Libera- 
tors and B-25 Mitchells. 

Under the Pacific Ocean 
command last year the Seventh 
moved its bases 2,000 miles 
closer to Tokyo, hitting the 
Marshalls and the Marianas for 
landings on Kwajelin, Eniv/e- 
tok, Saipan, Tinian and Guam. 
Their bombers ranged over 
16,000,000 square miles of the 
Pacific neutralizing Yap, 
Woleai, Wake, Iwo Jima and 
other Jap bases. 

White, who took over the 
Seventh Command from Maj, 
Gen, Willis Hale, served as 
deputy commander of the 13th 
Air Force under Maj. Gen 
Paul B. Wurtsmith.

SCOUTING EXPEDITION 

An odd, perhaps deeply significant, pa% n h as emerged 
from the news ihh week. Coinciding with the ?j rst [ qqq plane 
assault on Tokyo was a vigorous criticism of Jap 4fl ' s W a T leaders 
for hiding truth from the people, by the d^ n 0 f Japanese 
journalists, Soho Tokutoml. At the same time i ^ ss ; 3 f an t Secre- 
tary of State Joseph Grew took occasion to jj^j Japan 
had made any bona fide peace offers* 

It is too early to attempt to draw specify conc | us ; ons from 
these seemingly unrelated developments. carr ; eS its 

own connotation pointing toward a disintegrate 0 f Japanese 
resoluteness, which, when merged, could f° r ^ ac j ow an earlier 
end of the war than present schedules would >jj ca f e# 

The language used by Grew in denying j apanese peace 
offers was interesting in itself. For the ffrsj t ; m ^ foe State 
Department went on record officially as rev^|j ng ^ at - 



con- 



* ! ,g qt1 Francisco, one of the "fightingest" a i 

n t the TJ S Navy, participated, in tne inv*»

Japan 

Okinawa was the 30th Jap- 
anc-se-held island and possession 
against which guns <rf ^<;J* 
year-old cruiser 
since Pearl 
escaped 



versa tions relating to peace have been repo^j +Q tn ; s office 
from various points of the world," 

He went on to say that "in no case had ^ approac h been 
made to this government, directly or indirectly ^ a person who 
could establish his authority to speak for the j apanese govern- , 
ment/* 

The inference 1% obvious that powerful 

elements among 

Japans hierarchy are scouting American pg^; c opinion, and 
world opinion, for a preview of what actual } eNnS fo e Allies 
would insist upon. 

It !s an old trick. Hitler practiced it fo r tw0 yearS before 
the rotten structure of Fascism In Europe wa< f orc ;b|y torn down 
by Allied arms. It is an attempt to sow seed 5 of dissent among 
the nations allied against Japan; a devio^ appea | + 0 war- 
v/eary elements among our own people. 

Just as Hitler failed, so will Japan fail, As Srew pu f \\ t 
"Japanese militarism must and will be erush^ j ne policy of 
this government has been, is, and will eonh n , je +0 fe e ^condi- 
tional surrender." 

Japan's agents of peace, who are seeing j Q ejc t rac + some- 
thing more than unconditional surrender, ^ doomed to dis- 
appointment.

sad fact thaj^apan ^ only to accept.

/cites to Curtail 
Export of Coal 



WASHINGTON — Overseas 
shipments of American mined 
coals, except to the U* S. Army 
and Navy, will be prohibited un- 
less they have received specific 
approval of the Solid Fuels Ad- 
ministration for Wat, Adminis- 
trator Harold L. Ickes an- 
nounced Wednesday, 

The ruling, effective of July 
20, is not designed to determine 
or establish quotas for export 
but to give SPA closer control 
over the sources and types of 
coal destined for export abroad, 
he said* 

Among factors to be consid- 
ered in determining approval of 
shipments for export are 
whether they fall within govern- 
ment quotas that may be estab- 
lished from time to time; 
whether the size and kind 
sought should be made available ; 
or whether purpose for which 
the coal will be used can be met 
with lower grades than those 
requested.

Stassen Sees Possibility 

Of Unanimous Charter Okay 

SAN FRANCISCO— Navy Commander Harold E. 
Stassen back on active duty after serving as a delegate 
to the United Nations conference, yesterday declared he 
saw "definite possibility of unanimous ratification of 
the United Nations charter in the U. S. Senate " 

"I am encouraged by sentiment for the charter 
which I encountered in Washington and throughout the 
nation," Stassen said. "It will surely be ratified. It 
would be most appropriate since the Senate made a 
unanimous declaration of war, if its declaration of peace, 
the United Nations charter, also was unanimous." 



He said main contribution of 
the U. S. delegation at the con- 
ference was "the steady support 
of the basic principles resulting 
in the adoption of human rights* 
full discussion of the aspects of 
the charter, and leadership m 
mediating discussion among 
other countries." 

Stassen asserted "all the pow- 
ers were drawn closer by the 
conference," enabling them "to 
find a common meeting ground." 
He added that with sound poli- 
cies and good faith anions gov- 
ernments "wo can make it 

work." . iU 

Turning to the war m tne 
Pacific, Stassen said "we must 
count on a long, bitter fight," 



although observing, "surrender 
would be the smartest thing the 
Japanese coid£ do. They are 
already beattfh." 

He said that "Japanese air 
strength was broken last Sep- 
tember and October and has been 
going down ever since. Our 
strategic bombing has reduced 
Japan's ability to produce air- 
craft in sufficient numbers to 
replace her losses/'

GUAM — Another fleet 
of from 500 to 550 Super 
Fortresses from the Maria- 
nas dropped over 3,000 tons 
of incendiary and explosive , 
bombs before dawn yes- 
terday on four Japanese 
cities and oil centers spread 
over 480 miles of Honshu 
and ShikokiL 

The new attacks ranged from 
Uwajima on the west central 
coast of Shikoku, to as far east 
as Utsunomiya, a city of 80.C00 
population, 60 miles north of 
Tokyo, Other cities hits along 
the way were the munitions 
center of Ichinomiya, 9 miles 
northwest of Nagoya on the 
main dotibletrack line between 
Nagoya and Gifu, and Tusuru- 
ga, which lies on the west cen- 
tral part of Honshu, 

The attacking waves of 
Super Fortresses dropped in- 
cendiaries on the four cities 
and demolition bombs on Ka- 
wasaki petroleum center on 
the reclaimed island in Tokyo 
Bay. Located there were fa- 
cilities of Nippon Oil Com- 
pany* Standard-Vacuum Oil 
Company, Rising Sun Oil 
Company, and the Mitsui 
storage depot. 

Yesterday's assault marked 
the 49 th saturation fire mission 
of Super Forts from the Ma- 
rianas and brought their total 
of Japanese homeland cities 
hit to 38. 

The attack came after lighter 
bombers and fighters had car- 
ried the air war to the Jap* 
anese homeland in quick suc- 
ceeding blows prior to the rec- 
ord-scale 1,000 XL S. Navy car- 
rier strike on Tokyo airfields

THE LAST LAP 

The announced transfer this week of all American Army 
air force planes on Okinawa to the command of General Mac- 
Arthur presses a significant expansion in the already-intensi- 
fied air war Against Japan. 

The move accomplished two things. First, it advanced 
General MacArthur's operational control 1,000 miles closer to 
Japan — from the Philippines to Okinawa. Today, General Mac- 
Arthur's advance guard stands poised only 350 miles from the 
southern tip of the Japanese homeland island of Kyushu. 

Second, it added to MacArthur's command another air 
force — the Seventh Air Force — to bolster striking power 
of the already battle-tested Fifth and 13th. 

So far, Japan has been rocked only by armadas of B-29 
Super Fortresses, punctuated from time to time by carrier planes. 
Now, as the 13th, the Fifth, and the Seventh shuttle their planes 
onto Okinawa's rapidly expanding runways, something new in 
the strategic campaign to erase Japan's war potential will be 
added. 

As General George C. Kenney, MacArthur's air deputy 
and commander of Far East A!r Forces announced yesterday: 

"As soon as we are in position we will attack Japan from 
10,000 feet and from 10 feet, with fire and explosives, with 
bombers and fighters — and we'll do it 24 hours a day.' r 

This something new that has been added is pinpoint bomb- 
ing by fleets of Liberators, Mitchells, Havocs, Lightnings, Thun- 
derbolts, and Mustangs — a technique perfected in jungles of 
New Guinea, mountain ranges of Luzon, and sweeps through 
Bismarck and China seas. 

B-29's will continue to carry the main brunt of high altitude 
pattern bombing. But key plants, bridges, railways, airdromes, 
shops, docks and refineries which collectively spell Japan's ability 
to resist invasion now are in for the same round-the-clock treat- 
ment as paved the way for Germany's defeat on the continent 
of Europe. 



Griswold Sees 
Fast Cleanup 
r Noirith Luzon 



A fast, aggressive cleanup of 
the enemy in northern Luzon 
was promised yesterday by Lt. 
Gen. 0. W. Griswold, command- 
er of the 14th Corps. 

Although the Japs are not 
capable of major organized re- 
sistance, a quick mop up is de- 
sired. The enemy has been driven 
into the unexplored Sierra Ma- 
dre mountains, rising 7,000 feet 
east of the Cagayan valley and 
,the Cordillera range to the west. 

Griswold said it was imprac- 
tical to comb the trackless moun- 
tains. Small patrols will be 
sent out until most of the estim- 
ated 15,000 Japs left wore elim- 
inated.

eral Robert E. Hannegan first

Hannegan said the stamp 
breaks a precedent by portray- 
ing living persons. He added: 
"We honor the individuals here 
depicted who, by God's mercy, 
still live amongst us. In the 
glorious tradition of the Marine

Urgent Need 

Of US. Aid 

All plans on rehabilitation

Dr. Locsin counseled patience 
if help is not immediately forth- 
coming from Ainerica because 
"the requirements of war must 
come first and the rehabilitation 
of our country comes next." 

Filipinos, he declared, are in 
a situation which calls for united 
and concentrated action on the 
part of Filipino leaders and "of 
a people, one and resolute."

with D.D.T. a few days after 
the operation was under way. 
Similarly at Correffidor, 
planes equipped with tanks 
filled with D.D.T. in oil solu- 
tion were called in to elimin- 
ate millions of flies that rose 
from the bodies of Japanese 
soldiers after the short, bitter 
battle. 

Before large-scale spraying 
by air was adopted, tests were 
made in a rice paddy and a 
sago swamp, both heavily in- 
fested with insects. After 
spraying, it was found that al- 
most 100 per cent of insect life 
has disappeared. 

Now it is standard procedure

possible after its occupation by

as "one of the miracle develop, 
ments of this war" and gave j 
equal credit with atabrine fo 
lowering the incidence of % 
most disabling tropical disease; 

Since malaria ceased to be ; 
major problem in the Manil; 
area, malaria control and sur- 
vey units have been given othei 
work. Some were detailed I

others to work on fly control. 

They are given a large share

Vinson Supports Full Job 
Plan Under Senate Study 

WASHINGTON — Fred M. Vinson, director of 
war mobilization and reconversion, Thursday night 
reiterated support of the Murray- Wagner full em- 
ployment bill now before the Senate banking 
committee. 

Vinson described the bill as the "first necessary 
step from which a full dress program of economic 
policies to promote the well-being of our free compe- 
titive economy will stem." 3? 



The bill would have the 
government step in with fede- 
ral works projects if necessary 
to keep employment from fall- 
ing below specified standards. 

American producers, Vinson 
said, "will supply goods and 
employment" but creation of 
markets to absorb products of 
employment cannot be left to 
chance. "Business, labor and 
agriculture cannot in themselves 
assure maintenance of high 
levels of production and em- 
ployment" and "government 
acting upon behalf of all people 

sUDmty." assume this respon - 

President Truman recently 
announced he would nominate 
Vinson as secretary of Treas 
ury when he returned 
Berlin.

Grew Reveals 
No US. Sugar 
Goes to Spain 

WASHINGTON — Act- 
ing Secretary of State 
Joseph C, Grew yesterday 
announced that no sugar 
was being shipped from 
the U. S. to Spain. 

In accordance with a joint 
British- American supply agree^ 
rnent, Grew added Spain was to 
receive 30,000 tons of sugar 
during the first half of 1945, 
supplied from British sources in 
the Caribbean and being trans- 
ported on Spanish ships* Spain, 
in return, has agreed not to 
enter the world sugar market 
for any other sugar, he said. 

Grew explained this quantity 
is not only below the Spanish 
requirements but is 40 percent 
less than Spain received 
under a similar agreement in 
the second 6 months of last year.

Removal of Nazis From Spain 
Slowed by Transport Shortage 

MADRID — Plans for the deportation of German 
nationals from Spain are being held up primarily be- 
cause of lack of transportation facilities, a New York 
Times dispatch declared Thursday. 

Tire dispatch said an official 
source declared while the Allies' 
representatives had not agreed, 
precisely, on persons whom they 
desired repatriated to Germany, 
each had his own lists and it was 
a matter only of comparing 
them, He indicated they wore 
principally interested in depor- 
tation of known agents and high 
German officials.

Outlaw Band of 29 Japs 
On Okinawa Wiped Out 

OKINAWA — A band of 29 heavily armed Japanese 
was wiped out, Thursday, in a two-hour battle with alert 
American troops, marking the first organized enemy at- 
tack since the Okinawa campaign officially closed. 

The Japs attempted to infiltrate American lines 
and upset gun emplacements at the 24th Corps head- 
quarters* They succeeded in moving to within 200 yards 
of Lt, Gen. John R. Hodges' headquarters, when they 
were surprised by a 12-man American patrol. 
— & Two Jap maehinegun 



ing kept under some sort of 
surveillance, there was no longer 
any attempt to restrict their 
movements within Spain, it was 
indicated* 

The "general idea," the offi- 
cial declared, "is that they can- 
not fret out of the country, and 
while we do not like to see them 
circulating freely, the best we 
can do is to hope to get them 
back to Germany as many as 
possible, as quickly as possible/' 



posi- 
tions were discovered by the 
patrols as it n cared through the 
heaVily wooded hilly country 
near Nakagusuku castle. Both 
machinegun positions were man- 
ned, and Americans opened fire. 

The Japs used machineguns 
and mortars from behind trees 
and rocks. An inspection of 
the equipment on the dead 
showed it to be of both Ameri- 
can and Japanese manufacture, 
with American carbines and food 
probably stolen from stores. 

Six sabers were taken, indi- 
cating Jap officers were among 
the band.

Okinawans Help Ameri<

nciais now disclosed Wednesday. 

l?lan O^S Xa?e chosen to aid the AMG are 
distinctive red helmets and yellow arm bands, 
of them are former mayor s^ of villages. 
"We hope eventually to have* 
to 60 of them in each of our 



ten camps established for Oki- 
nawan civilians," said Lt. 
ward Uhlir of the AMG public 
safety department. * , 

The AMG divided the island 
into three military districts in 
order to more easily administer 
the affairs of more than a 
quarter million Okinawans. Si- 
multaneously, authorities were 
faced with the gigantic problem 
of turning the island into a huge 
military navy and air base. 

In addition to public safety, 
the authorities also were active 
in re-uniting parted families 
through inter-district exchange. 

"We have had some heart- 
rending scenes when parents, 
who have given their children 
up for lost, again are joined 
with them. These scenes refute 
the general impression that Oki- 
nawans are emotionless and 
stoical, immune to the horrors 
of war," Naval Welfare Officer 
Donald Blackburn observe d.

CALCUTTA — Maj, Gen. 
Claire Chennault, one of 
America's most spectacular 
air commanders and former 
head of the famous American 
Volunteer Group — the Flying 
Timers— yesterday announced 
his retirement as comman- 
der of the U. Si 14th Air 
Force based in China. 

The announcement was 
made simultaneously in Cal- 
cutta and Kunmimr and 
Chunffkingr with permission 
of Lt. Gen. A. C, Wedemeyer, 
commander of U. S. forces m 
the China theater. 

It came two days after it 
was announced, an augment- 
ed TJ- S. Air Force in China 
would be headed by Lt. Gen, 
George E. Stratemeyer. 

Chennault had retired eight 
years ago for his health, and 
had spent most of that tune 




in China, being summoned to 
active duty again in the U.S. 
Army after entrance of 
America into war. 

In a statement announcing 
retirement, Gen, Chennault 
said the "Japanese now are 
beaten in the air in China." 
He expressed hope he would 
return home as soon as the 
transition is made to Gen. 
Stratemeyer's new organiza- 
tion.

Shakeup in Franco 
Government Rumored 

MADRID, SPAIN— Spanish 
newspapers yesterday carried 
the full text of "The Bill of 
Rights" unanimously passed 
Saturday by parliament but 
made no mention of the 
shakeup believed imminent 
in the Franco cabinet. 

Franco has dropped the 
secretary general of the Fa-

apparently in a move to make 
his government more accept- 
able to the United States, a

ties. 

Location of yesterday's 
air blows had not yet been 
announced. 

Admiral Nimitz declared 
flatly the aerial and naval 
bombardment of northern 
Japan was being carried 
out for "purpose of extend- 
ing and tightening the naval 
and air blockade of Japan 
and destroying Japanese 
resources/* 

Actually, Admiral Nimitz an- 
nounced the shore bombard- 
ment of Hokkaido hours before 
it was confirmed by reports 
from the fleet— holding telling 
the enemy that the U. S. fleet 
was going to strike again, an un- 
precedented action. The bomb- 
ardment then began at 35 min- 
utes after midnight yesterday, 
Tokyo time, 

A special announcement from 
naval headquarters on Guam 
said that Saturday's heavy 
naval gunfire demolished the 
steel mill at Kamaishi, Nearby 
eoke ovens were heavily hit 
and at last report, great fires 
in the city had spread to the 
harbor area. 

Of the enemy shipping toll 
Saturday, 15 were sunk and 24 
were damaged. Most of them 
were small commercial type* 
but dne ,old destroyer was list- 
ed as sunk and two destroyer- 
escorts as damaged. 

Twenty-four Japanese planes 
were destroyed and 62 darni 
aged on the ground Saturday 
and another was shot down near 
the American task force. Nimitz 
said most of the enemy aircraft 
were found on airfields at Mat- 
sushita, Matsudo and Misawa 
on Honshu, adding: 

i( No opposition to our forces 
was reported." 

The 27 locomotives were de-

EPIC IS CLOSED 

Raymond Swing, noted American radio commentator, 
brings up a significant point which gives added meaning to the 
unprecedented hammer blows now being rained against the Jap- 
anese homeland by the United States fleet. 

Swing hails the penetration of Japanese home waters as the 
close of the "long epic of Japan's safety in space." 

He points out that this week's carrier attacks "demonstrated 
that we can control the coast and air over Japan at any time 
we choose and even suicide tactics of Japanese flyers can be 
rendered useless. 

"Japan has been made safe in all its history by the divinity 
of geography. It was invulnerable. One can well believe that 
not a Japanese leader in 1941 took seriously the possibility that 
Japan could be severed from the empire it was about to con- 
quer and itself be invaded. The Japanese were puffed up by 
their own security. 

"Today, we are masters of geography. It is no longer a 
shield to Japan." 

The point is that Germany too, relied on the 3,000 miles of 
Atlantic which separated the United States from the mainland 
of Europe, laughed at American plans to swing the balance of 
power on the continent. 

Germany too believed that the closer she was driven to her 
home frontiers the shorter her supply lines would grow, while 
those of her allies would lengthen into disaster. But history 
proved otherwise in Europe. 

And today, in the waters off Japan, within gunshot and 
eyesight of a startled Japanese population, history also is prov- 
ing otherwise in the Pacific.

Though Samar was liberated 
some eight months ago, condi- 
tions in many towns, especially 
in the western and northern 
sections, have not yet returned 
to normal, according to Agripi- 
no Escareal, former assembly- 
man from that province, who 
arrived in Manila this week. 

Escareal said even schools 
have not yet been opened and 
the new governor has not been 
able to hold a single session of 
the provincial board. 

Prices of foodstuffs, especial- 
ly in the provincial capital, 
were exorbitant, he said. Rice 
is scarce in many municipali- 
ties and substitute crops are 
not available. Transportation 
throughout the province is ex- 
tremely difficult on account of 
bad roads and absence of 
vehicles.

12 P.I. Officers 
Arrive in US. 
For Training 

LOS ANGELES— Twelve Fi- 
lipino officers arrived in Los 
Angeles Saturday, en route to 
an eastern army base for spe- 
cial training in preparation for 
operations against Japan. 

The | men, who were sent to 
the U. S.. by Gen. Mac Arthur, 
were met by Mrs. Maria Que- 
zon, widow of the late Filipino 
president. All of them are sur- 
vivors of the death march from 
Bataan, except one, who fought 
as a guerrilla until the islands 
were liberated. 

"Every Filipino is ready to 
give his life in the attack on 
Japan. We want to remove the 
Japanese threat to peace in the 
Far East," asserted Maj. Ernes- 
to Banes, ranking officer of the 
group. ^ 

The men will return to the 
Philippines after an intensive 
course in ordnance at the Aber- 
deen, Md., proving grounds to 
become key men in the reconsti- 
tuted all-Filipino Army division 
under Maj. Gen. Basilio Valdes. 



Twenty-seven men were gra- 
duated from the Manila Fire 
Department Training School at 
Tanduay on July 10. This 
brings the total to 101 since the 
opening of the training school 
last April. Lt. Col. Joseph L.

graduates-

Reveals Enemy 
Now Fighting 
Smarter War' 

GLENS PALLS, N.Y.— 
jiie surrender exacted of 
Japan will have to be ex- 
acted by force, Undersec- 
retary of War Robert Pat- 
terson declared here Sat- 
urday, adding "Japan 
will not surrender to an 
inference, an inference 
that it is beaten." 

"We must prepare ourselves 
to win the war with Japan the 
hard way— by killing Japanese 
soldiers right through the ruins 
of Tokyo and throughout the 
home islands/ 1 he warned. 

Patterson expressed the opi- 
nion that the enemy soldier is 
fighting more effectively and 
has developed a new method 
of cave warfare. He pointed out 
that from now on the fighting 
will be in a country favoring 
the defender. 

"The Japanese are fighting a 
progressively smarter war*' he 
observed, adding: "On Okinawa 
they did not attempt the de- 
fense of the beaches, where 
they would be under point- 
blank naval gunfire. They went 
back to prepared positions. In 
other words they picked their 
battlefield."

tig, who commanded guerrillas 
in Mindanao, for his part in the 
liberation of the Philippines. 

The resolution said Col. Fer- 
tig had established the Com- 
monwealth government in cer- 
tain sections of Mindanao be- 
fore the arrival of American 
troops. 

Fertig succeeded in coordinat- 
ing all guerrilla units in Min-

Christians and non-Christians, 
the resolution said.

Mrs. MacArthur Lauds 
Showing Of Filipiniana 

To almost all of its WAC 
and GI audience at the Rex 
Theatre Tuesday niprht, fl Fili- 
piniana," the Phibsec Athletic 
and Recreation Section's presen- 
tation of Philippine folk songs 
and dances, was an entirely new 
experience; but to Mrs. Dou- 
glas MacArthur, wife of the 
General of the Army, it was an 
occasion to renew acquaintance 
with old friends- Playing to a 
packed house headed by repre- 
sentatives of American military 
and Philippine governments, the 
show gave a glimpse of native 
art and culture seldom offered 
now in battle-torn Manila. 

"It was a lovely show indeed/' 
Mre. MacArthur said. |f I am 
very glad to see your folk dances 
and hear your folk songs again, 
r especially liked the Bamboo 
Dance. It's an old favorite of 
mine," 

The general's wife praised 
the performance and the people 
responsible for it and said she 
thought it would be a good idea 
to show Philippine dances back 
in the States to give more 
Americans a chance to see local 
art at its best

WITH 24th DIV., MINDA- 
NAO — A story of 40 Japanese 
women and children, with 
their throats cut, gave re- 
newed indication today that 
thousands of the emperor's 
subjects in the Davao area 
may resort to mass murder 
and suicide. 



Haru Ito, a foreman and 
civilian employe of the Jap 
army before his capture, told 
an officer of the 24th Division 
staff that he had seen the 
bodies in the Tamogan sector 
on July 1. Some bodies had 
also been cut by artillery fire. 



Ito told the officer sole 
survivor was a 12-year-old 
girl who had been left behind 
by retreating Imperial troops, 
along with thousands of other 
civilians who broke up into 
small bands seeking food and 
water. # 

The child said sick, starv- 



ing women, fearing capture, 
found themselves between 
American and Jap lines. 

Artillery shells dropned in 
the vicinity, and frantic 
mothers killed their children 
and then themselves. Those 
who would not commit suicide 
were murdered by the others.

JAPAN CAN'T HALT INVASIC

CASTING THEIR SHADOWS 

Within the past few days American carrier planes have sent 
more than 1,000 planes over Tokyo in successive days without 
meeting challenge. # 

Within the past week, two separate forces of American 
battleships have knifed through Japan's sacred offshore waters 
to bombard key cities. 

According to the book, this should be impossible. Ac- 
cording to naval strategy, as worked out in the classrooms, war- 
ships must never engage in protracted operations within range 
of home-based airpower. 

Imagine what would happen should a Japanese fleet sail 
within five miles of San Francisco harbor, within reach of our 
Flying Fortresses, Liberators, or Mitchells. Imagine the internal 
turmoil, the unrest, the loss of public faith which would ensue 
in America should such a catastrophe transpire. 

What has happened to Japan? Why does Japan s air 
force refuse to protect the air over its sacred capital? Why 
does Japan's Navy, shattered though it may be, refuse to put 
up even token resistance? 

The answer is that the battles of attrition are beginning to 
pay off. The distant battles of New Guinea, Kwajalein, Moro- 
tai, Leyte, Iwo Jima, and Luzon are beginning to reap dividends. 
Japan's fruitless campaigns to halt General MacArthurs ad- 
vance from the south and Admiral Nimitz's sweep from the east 
have cost Japan the thousands of squandered planes, ships and 
men which today could be defending her own coasts and her 

own cities. , 

The people of Japan must be asking a lot of questions these 
days. They know that the first requisite to invasion is the ability 
of an enemy to conduct operations within gun range of Japan s 
coastal defenses and within bombing range of Japan's land-based 

airpower. ■ i I 

The Japanese know, too, that this week, off Japans coast- 
line, the first requisite to invasio^has_been met. 



Super Forts Demolish 
7 Airfields on Kyushu 

GUAM— Japan's aviation maintenance and repair 
facilities at seven airfields on Kyushu were destroyed 
and from 90 to 100 percent destroyed at six other air-

May, the 21st Bomber Command announced Sunday.

New Labor Chief 
Pushes All-Out 
War Schedule 

WASHINGTON — Secretary

day/urged labor and manage- 
ment to cooperate to the ±ui 
lest in the interest of victory 
over Japan and for a sound 
post-war economy. 

To management, Schwellen- 
bach said, "I shall expect man- 
agement to refrain from doing 
those things, thoughtlessly or 
purposefully, which provoke 
men and tempt them to act 
first and to reason later. 

Addressing labor, he said 
that the government had creat- 
ed adequate machinery to set- 
tle labor disputes peaceably. 
Asking workers to respect the 
"no strike" pledge he added, 
"To advance any demand to a 
point of stopping production 
instead of using the machinery 
available for a peaceful settle 
ment is not in the national in 
terest and will not be support 
ed by public opinion."

Another Destroyer 
Joins U. S. Fleet* 

BATH, MAINE — The 2,000- 
ton destroyer, named for the late 
Rear Admiral James Henry 
Glennon, U. S. N., was launched 
Sunday from the Bath Iron 
Works ways on the Kennebec 
river. 

The vessel is the second des 
troyer to bear the Glennon name, 
the first having been announced 
as lost last July "during opera- 
tions for Europe's liberation." 

Glennon commanded a battle- 
ship squadron in the last war 



Secretary of the Navy For- 
restal's press conference, ex- 
nects to Return to a new com- 
mand Vn the Pacific shortly. 
Barbey, under the direc- 
tion of General Douglas Mac- 
Arthur, landed more than 
1,000,000 soldiers ^nd marines 
and upwards of 1,200,UUU 
tons of supplies and equip- 
ment during 56 amphibious 
operations in less than two 
years. 

The operations ranged from 
the assault of June, 1943, when 
a handful of men stormed the 
tiny Woodlark and Kanwma 
islands southwest of New Geor- 
gia, to the latest Allied stab at 
Balikpapan. 

Barbey was in tactical and 
administrative command of 
more than 800 ships carrying 
more than 100,000 navy men 
en route to Lingayen Gulf — 
a lighting force larger than 
the U. S. peacetime navy of 
1937. 

He is a firm believer in put- 
ting assault troops and sup- 
plies speedily ashore before 
enemy land and air power can 
be mustered for a counter- 
attack. 

A striking example of this 
was his landing 55,000 men, 
plus most of their equipment, 
ashore at Hollandia, Aitape, 
and at Tanahmaran Bay in 
four hours on April 22, 1944. 

The largest invasion by the 
Seventh Amphibious Force was 
the northern attack force strike 
in Lingayen Gulf, January 9, 
1945. 

In the assault and follow-up 
operations his transport and

With the help of a unit of the U. S. Army, officers 
of the Paraiiaque sub-precinct of the Manila Police Fri-

Manila Military Phone System 
Switches Over to Dial Basis 

A Phone call at noon Sunday from MaJ. Gen. Edmond H. Leavey, Deputy 
rnmmander, AFWESPAC, to Maj. Gen. Spencer B. Aiken, Theater Signal Of- 
«!S Scnal ed the cutover that put military telephone communications in the 
Manila Sea on a dial basis, terminating an expedient system which had operat- 

Sl T C he Changeover means that it is now possible to telephone over the 250- 



rmlc length of Luzon from Batangas to Lmgayen 
than thirty thousand circuit miles of copper wire. 

Numerous technical difficul- 
ties had to be overcome by Ma- 
nila Signal Corps units which 
worked twelve to eighteen 
Wrs a day rehabilitating 
bombed and sabotaged equip- 
ment of the Philippine Long 
nistance Telephone Company. 
Pintine of the central Manila 
exchanV was an additional 
complication. 

According to an executive of 
fh p Manila Communications 
Svteion the present system 
g£SS r-« radically different 
rSttern from communications 
gstems installed in pr™« 
Pacific operations such as Hol- 
fandia and Leyte. He com- 
S the task of jnstaUation 
Cl rehabilitation in Manila to 



the setting up of wire commu- 
nications in Paris, following its 
re-occupation by Allied troops. 
"The Manila job was even more 
difficult than the Paris opera- 
tion due to the greater extent 
of enemy sabotage and the ef- 
fect of American bombing/* 
he said. 

Extent of the cutover was in- 
dicated by comparing facilities 
of a one-position, 40-line cap- 
tured Japanese switchboard to 
the present automatic step -by- 
step equipment, which is si- 
milar to that used in most 
urban areas of the United 
States. The Japanese switch- 
board, termed the "Manila Ex- 
change/* during the first days 
of the American re-occupation, 
served twenty-seven lines in 



Facilities required more 

comparison with the new sys- 
tem which serves and estimat- 
ed 2,500 telephones in the 
Manila area. This was rough- 
ly equivalent to wire facilities 
in an American city of 50,000 
population, 

A realistic sign of the sys- 
tem's growth is the 3,363 per- 
sonnel now in the Manila 
Communications Division as 
compared with the Jap switch- 
board staff of twenty-seven 
signal corps personnel. Ameri- 
can WAC and enlisted person- 
nel, and Filipino women ope- 
rators, some of whom served in 
similar capacities before the 
war, are doing the actual job 
of providing communications 
facilities for Manila and its 
suburbs.

Battleship Force Stands Off 
Honshu in Six-Hour Assault 

GUAM — Eyewitness descriptions of the historic 
American Third Fleet task force bombardments of the 
Japanese* coast last Saturday and Sunday told how S. 
battleships, cruisers and destroyers "swaggered back 
and forth almost within rifle shot" of Honshu and Hok- 
kaido without opposition. 

James Lindsley, aboard the Battleship South Dakota

iron works at Kamaishi in northern Honshu.

ers was in plain sight of Japan 
for three hours before the bom- 
bardment started and for some 
time afterward. The Japanese 
chose to do very little about it* 
As this is written there is no 
report of damage to American 
vessels in this action— one of 
the most spectacular in the Pa- 
cific war." 

For the moment, Hokkai- 
do's important coal supplies 
— 3D percent of the empire's 
coal production — were com- 
pletely cut off as a result of 
U.S. sea and air assaults dur- 
ing the last two days, the 
Associated Press reported 
from Guam. 

Both rail and port installa- 
tions were so badly crippled 
that the enemy will be unable 
to manage more than a frac- 
tion o£ normal traffic, naval 
sources said. 

Shelling of Kamaishi was 
described as one of the most 
successful ever delivered by 
American ships against indus- 
trial targets. 

National Broadcasting Com- 
pany Correspondent Joe Hain- 
line, describing Sunday's bom- 
bardment of the Hokkaido 
steel center of Muroran, said 
the three super battleships 
Iowa, Missouri, and Wisconsin 
"after one practice salvo never 
missed their target."

REPEATING HISTORY 

. To get an idea of what po 55 ;b!y may transpire in the Battle 

5 ^fV^UT 0 P rofitab, y ^view what happened in the 
Bathe of the Philippines. 

These two battjes probably will share several things in com- 

m °1l Ik k t 1 P r ° b,em ' 35 ^erican forces stand poised 
on the threshold of Japan, is not unlike fhe task which lay ahead 
of General MacArtW only nine months ago before the Phil- 
ippine campaign was launched. 

U n u "A f ' Siml h? y f f t er "I"- BofH are island groups. 

Hokkaido, Honshu and Kyushu have their counterparts, geogra- 
phically :n Leyte, Mindanao and Luzon. In area, Japan is only 
shghtly larger — 148,756 square miles to 115 600 

Log.stically and tactically, there are the same amphibious 
conditions to m ee f. Troops must be staged, fleets gathered, 
supp.es massed for an overwater landing on hostile island shores. 

The story of the Battle of the Philippines is a classic in 
m.Iitary strategy. General MacArthur, smoothly meshing the 
components of and, sea, and air power, directed over 30 major 

fk o7T r - amp ib ' OUS ' dndIn9s throu 9h scattered islands of 
the Philippines group. In each case the Jap was overwhelmed 
in every category of arms. In each case he was outwitted. 
In each case he was outfought. In something like eight months, 
a Japanese army of more than 400,000 men was cut down and 
wiped out by an inferior number of American troops. 

Japan would do well to study events which led up to the 
first blow ,n the Philippine campaign, as well as the campaign 
itself For the same team— General MacArfhur and Admiral Hal- 
sey— have been ticketed for a repeat performance. 

Preceding the Leyte landing, General MacArthur secured 
the small :sand of Morotai, from which planes were launched to 
br-ng Mindanao and the lower Visayas under American land- 
based air power. 

/ Preceding the Leyte landing, Admiral Halse/s Third Ple-t 
went on a rampage of the sea lanes which sent carrier planes 
and battleship shells over Formosa. Japan, Iwo Jima, the Ryu- 
kyus as well as the Philippines, leaving enemy strategists com- 
pletely baffled as to where the next blow would fall. 

Today, the stage is being set for another American move. 
The seizure of Morofai has its counterpart in the winning of 
Luzon, Iwo Jima and Okinawa from which American air forces 
have initiated land-based strikes against Kyushu, against For- 
mosa, against Korea, against the China coast. 

Today. Halsey's fleet again is on the rampage, just as it 
played a similar role 1 1 months ago in smashing Japan's power- 
ful airforce on the ground and in the skies, sinking or scattering 
her shipping, and bombarding key shoreline defenses. Whether 
the next move will be against Japan, or some place on the main- 
land of Asia remains to be seen. That is for Japan to guess 
This much is obvious. In the Philippines, America fashioned 
the end of the beginning for Japan. Today, in the wafers off 
foltyo, fhe world is witnessing the beginning of the end

wiped out by Germans in one of 
the most abominable crimes of

"We Americans approve of the 
speed with which Czechoslovakia 
is setting up a special people's 
court to try collaborators and 
war criminals. It is important

Army Supplies 
2 Million Tons 
Of Europe Aid 

WASHINGTON— The XL S 
9 nJ^Ann shi ' } l>ed more than 
-,000,000 tons of foodstuffs for 
lading of civilians in liberated 
areas since liberation of Euro- 
pean countries began last year, 
the War Department announced 
yesterday. 

Feeding of civilians in these 
areas by Allied troops is an ob- 
ligation only so far as the feed- 
ing may be necessary to pre- 
vent diseases, or riots or unrest 
such as might prejudice military 
operations or endanger Ameri- 
can troops. Otherwise it is not 
w ob il- ation of the Army, the 
De P ai,t "i B nt explained. 

Wheat and flour have ae^ 
counted for more than 70 per 
cent of all food exported for 
civilian feeding in Europe. 

Grew Welcomes War 
Entry By Italians 

WASHINGTON— Acting Sec- 
retary of State Joseph C. Grew 
yesterday commenting on Italy's 
declaration of war against 
Japan declared, "We are very 
happy to have our former enemy 
with us," 

Grew's statement was made 
shortly after the Italian ambas- 
sador, Alberto Tarchiani, an- 
nounced his country's action at 
a news conference. 

Italy is the 46th nation now at 
war with Japan. 



Unconditional Surrender 
Terms for Japan Are Aired 

WASHINGTON— Unconditional surrender meaning 
simply that the Japanese must lay down their arms, 
and the junking of their medieval system in "an orderly 
way" were propositions advocated by U, S, Sens. 
Elbert D, Thomas of Utah and Thomas C, Hart of Con- 
necticut, in a radio talk sponsored by the Department 
of State yesterday, 

Thomas explained the Japanese must lay down their 
arms to create groundwork for the people themselves to 
rebuild their country along: peaceful democratic lines. 

Concern inn; our basic policy inf*" " — J 

talking to Japan, Thomas as- ' 
serted "It is the policy of tel- 
ling the truth," 

He said that President Tru- 
man had made it clear that 
unconditional surrender will not 
moan death or enslavement for 
the Japanese people. 

Hart declared that Japanese 
militarists must be "absolutely 
discredited" before their people, 
and that the people themselves 
should "clean their own house, 
under their own constitution as 
rapidly as possible/ 1 adding that 
their medieval system should be 
"junked in an orderly way," 

Hart maintained that the 
Allies should occupy Japan as 
lon£ as is necessary to insure 
order in the world and to pre- 
vent new aggression, explain- 
ing: 

"That means until all the Jap- 
anese forces have been dis- 
banded, and all military equip- 
ment is removed or destroyed, 
and until a government that is 
free of militaristic elements and 
influences has been established."

Senate Group 
Approves Hike 
In US. Wages 

WASHINGTON— A resolution 
recommending Senate Congress 
give early consideration to 
amending the Fair Labor Stand- 
ards Act "with a view to rais- 
ing the statutory minimum 
wage and broadening coverage 
of the act" was yesterday en- 
dorsed by a Senate sub-commit- 
tee* The resolution specifically 
would direct that the War La- 
bor Board consider any wa^c 
under 65 cents an hour sub- 
standard. 

The law now fixes 40 cents 
an hour as the wage which may 
be paid by business" in interstate 
commerce, and, as the War La- 
bor Board accepts 55 cents as 
sub-standard, it charges wages 
can be raised to that level with- 
out regard for the wage stabili- 
zation program, 

The report pointed out, des- 
pite the relatively high level of 
war- time wages, millions of 
American workers and their fa- 
milies are today forced to exist 
on earnings insufficient to pro- 
vide even the barest minimum 
standard of living.

Not Even Pistol Shot Fired 

At Armada Off Hokkaido Coast 

ON BATTLESHIP IOWA OFF MURORAN— "The 
battleship Iowa is sitting within sight of Japan firing 
screaming salvos into Muroran but still the Japanese 
are not fighting/' yesterday wrote Ernest Hobrecht of 
the United Press, an eyewitness to the U- S. naval, air 
and sea bombardment of northern Japan, adding: 

"Not even an enemy pistol has been leveled at our 
warships although we are within 1,000 yards of land. 

"It is incredible that we could venture this close to 
the enemy homeland without a fight. There is land to 
port, land dead ahead and land to starboard. There 
must be Japanese shore batteries on that land, but they 
are not firing. 



"Approximately 1,000 tons of 
shell from the Iowa and other 
mifrhty warships of Admiral 
William F. Halsey's U. S. Third 
Fleet are crashing into Japan — 
the first time in this war that 
an enemy's industries have been 
brought under naval gunfire. 

"The main targets are the big 
iron and steel works at Muroran 
on the southern tip of Hokkai- 
do. To get into firing position 
we had to steam almost 125 miles 
into enemy water between Hok- 
kaido and Honshu. 

"The attack is now endjng. 
Our 16-inch guns have roared 
more than 800 times in 58 
minutes. 

"Our gunners fired with dead- 
ly accuracy. How accurate can 
best be described by quoting the 
words of spotters flying over 
the target. They repeatedly 
said 'No change — no change/ 
signifying our blows were pro- 
perly aimed. 

"T he spotters reported 'exten- 
sive damage/ and said the areas 
were 'thoroughly worked over.' 
"Our 10-ton broadsides 
caused a terrific explosion in 
the Nihon Steel Works. The 
Wanishi Iron Works and the 
Mitsubishi Coal factory were 
wrecked. When we fjirst 
peered out through the mur- 
ky morning we could see nu- 
merous buildings with tower- 
ing smoke stacks. Now, there 
Es smoke and fire and devas- 
tation in Muroran, once a 
city of 107,000 population. 

"While surface units were 
pounding Muroran, carrier 
planes were continuing their at- 
tacks on the Japanese home- 
lands. One pilot was forced 
down by a Japanese plane. He 
made a water landing near the 
d stroyer McGowan and was 
>avi d. 



"Our patrol planes kept the 
Japanese out of the air — at least 
in the vicinity of these ships. 
There was no Japanese attempt 
to attack us from the air or from 
the shore batteries. 

"It is all like a dream — that 
we could do what we have with- 
out opposition. 7 '

I wo Fighters Nip Honshu, Bag 37 
Planes, Meet Slight Opposition 



GUAM — More than 100 
Iwo-based Mustang fighters 
Sunday renewed the ham- 
mering of Honshu, destroying 
or damaging 37 Japanese 
planes and encountering the 
first enemy air opposition in 
several weeks when a mea- 
ger eight Jap planes rose to 
intercept the Mustang sweeps 
over airfields in the Nagoya 
area. 

The Mustang bag of Jap 



planes was made in strikes 
at six Nagoya airfields and 
in low level strafing assaults 
on shipping in Nagoya Bay 
and on railroad yards. Three 
Mustangs were lost. 

Four of the eight Jap in- 
terceptors were shot down by 
our fighters and three others 
were damaged. Nine enemy 
planes were wrecked on the 
ground and 21 others were 
listed as probably destroyed 



or damaged. 

In the strafing runs on rail 
and shipping targets, the 
pilots said they destroyed or 
damaged locomotives, gaso- 
line tanks, hangars and other 
airdrome installations. They 
also reported hitting five 
small freighters and three 
sampans. Anti-aircraft fire 
over the targets was "me- 
dium to intense."

Patrol Kills Fugitive Jap 
Air Chief on Okinawa 

OKINAWA— Lt. Col. Tokiharu Soyagi, Japanese 
air commander on Okinawa, was killed by a tL S. patrol 
as he attempted to flee from a camouflaged hideout in 
the northern mountains, Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell dis- 
closed yesterday. 

When Americans captured the Kadena airfield on 
the first day of the Okinawa invasion, Soyagi retreated 
northward,, fighting desperately from hill to hill 

The former commander of the^ 
air sector of Okinawa disap- 
peared during the battle, which 
broke the last organized resist- 
ance on the island. 

A 60-man American patrol 
was organized to capture him 
and the remnants of the Jap 
battalion. 

The patrol climbed almost per- 
pendicular cliffs in sweltering 
heat, and through brush so thick 
that it had to be cut away. Even 
trails had been camouflaged by 
planting brushes in them where 
they branched off mam paths. 

Soyagi was betrayed by a tiny 
wisp of smoke rising above a 
neatly camouflaged hut. 

Lt. Wallace S, Amioka of 
Honolulu got to within five feet 
of the gray-haired, gray-goateed 
Japanese who was sitting in the 
shade reading Soyagi was 
dressed in a striped kimona 

He was shot and killed instant-

freedom.

Hitachi Is Subjected to Two- 
Hour Concentrated Assault 

GUAM — Following up a 1 ,500 earner plane 
assault on Tokyo Tuesday launched from the 
world's most powerful naval force, American and 
British battlewagons again shelled the Japanese 
coast line early yesterday morning northeast of 
Tokyo. 

The British battleship King George V and 
her escorting ships joined Admiral Halsey's Third 
Fleet super battleships, cruisers and destroyers 
In the historic bombardment of the Hitachi area, 
60 miles up the coast from the Japanese capital. 

It was the first time in the war British war- 
ships had fired shells into the Japanese 
"^homeland. 

The bombardment followed by 
only a few hours the 1,500-pIus 
carrier plane attack on Tokyo's 
military installations and air- 
fields, extending northeast to 
Hitachi . 

The great men of war, includ- 
ing some of the most devastating 
battleships of the American and 
British Navies stood of the east- 
ern shore of Honshu in a rainy, 
misty night Steadily they 
threw their 2,700-pound sixteen- 
inch shells into Hitachi's highly 
concentrated aircraft, electrical 
and diesel engine plants and cop- 
per smelters, and also attacked 
nearby Sukegawa, 

Correspondents watching 
the show from aboard Ad- 
miral Halsey's warships 
reported the dreadnaughto 
closed to within about six 
miles of shore, hut the Jap- 
anese offered no opposition. 
The attack started about mid- 
night Tuesday and continued 
two hours. Overhead, British 
and American carrier planes 
flew protective cover, but their 
defensive escort proved uwieccs«

DOCTORS RELEASED 

WASHINGTON — Approxi-

Army policy is "to return" as 
many doctors to civilian prac-

Previous announcement that 
about 7,000 doctors would be re- 
leased during next nine months

Agusan Practically 
Cleared of Japanese 

Except for enemy remnants 
who fled to the distant moun- 
tains, Agusan province is cleared 
of Japanese, according to Agus- 
tin Casenas, Commonwealth 
provincial governor who arrived 
in Manila this week. The pro- 
vincial and municipal govern- 
ments are functioning smoothly 
under the guerrilla-appointed 
officials. 

Agusan was liberated by 
American and Filipino guerri- 
llas. But although peace and 
order had been restored in the 
different municipalities long 
ago, normalcy has not yet re- 
turned to the province, Casenas 
pointed out. Not a, single school 
has been opened since the Jap- 
anese occupation of the province. 
Three-fourths of Butuan, the 
capital, was destroyed when the 
guerrillas and the Japs staged 
an 11-day battle in the heart of 
the town sometime in March, 
1943. Food, however, is plenti- 
ful, he said. 



in supplies of fats and oils, 
sugar, condensed and evaporat- 
ed milk, canned fruits and 
vegeSbles. Rice and dried bean 
supplies will get shorter. 

He explained he was taking 
-positive steps- to increase pro- 
duction and improve distribu- 
tion of food. But he emphasized 
transportation difficulties make 
it impossible to move to con- 
sumers all of the fruit and 
fresh vegetable supplies. Also, 
because of the time it takes .to 
produce food, "not much relief 
from actual shortages can be 
expected during 1945." 

Possible arrangements for 
food importation from South 
America were among remedies 
now under consideration to re- 
lieve food shortages. 

The U. S. Army was curtail- 
ing many of its food require- 
ments, especially sugar needs 
which had been reduced by 
68,000 tons to release the com- 
modity so the fresh fruit crop 
could be preserved. 

Anderson stressed food needs 
of impoverished peoples of 
Europe must not be forgotten 
but noted that "we must be 
honest with them on this ques- 
tion, as we intend to be with our 
own people, and not lead them 
to expect more than we can 
supply. We still have a war to 
win."

CHUNGKING— "Justice, not

government in the treatment of 
puppets and collaborationists," 
recently declared Dr. P. H. 
Chang, Chinese -government 
spokesman, 

"If we were lenient toward 
puppets we would be doing a 
gross injustice to others who 
have suffered through their cci^ 
labor ation with the enemy," lie 
added, 

Chang cited the example of 
China's Chang Shan-kun, whom 
he described as being not unlike 
Britain's radio traitor, "Lord- 
Haw Haw/' who was arrested 
and committed to stand trial in 
accordance with the law of 
treason. 



among the shipping destroyed 
Which totaled 71,000 tons, while 
another 234 vessels totaling 
88,000 tons were damaged, in- 
cluding seven destroyer-escorts 
and three patrol craft, three 
train ferries, one transport, one 
cargo ship, nine tankers, and 14 
medium merchantmen. 

In the heaviest toll ever exact- 
ed by Allied forces against Jap- 
anese rail facilities, American 
carrier planes destroyed 84 
locomotives and damaged 40 
others. They also destroyed or 
damaged, factories, oil tanks, 
railroad yards, stations, ware- 
houses, bridges, ammunition 
depots, canneries and docks* 

The attacks were pressed 
through extremely adverse 
weather without loss of a single 
American surface ship. Sixteen 
XL S, airmen and 24 planes failed 
to return. 



Japanese Must Choose 

WASHINGTON— "Japan can follow the Ger- 
man example and see her cities destroyed or she can 
be realistic and save something for the future," 
Vice Admiral Daniel Barbey said in a radio talk 
yesterday* 

"If the Japanese continue fighting, then what 
happened to German cities and factories will seem 
like peaceful prosperity and perfect by comparison/' 
the veteran 7th Amphibious force commander said. 
He emphasized landings in Japan and China are 
"equal possibilities" and that a landing force could 
be ready within 30 to 90 days, depending on the size 
of the force, 



Volume of Food 
Reaching City 
is Increasing 

Foodstuffs are now arriving 
by the truckloads in Manila 
from the provinces, indicating 
an ever increasing trade be- 
tween the city and the rest of 
Luzon, the Emergency Control 
Administration reported yester- 
day. 

The EGA is reported to have 
encouraged the movement of 
food supplies from the provinces 
to the city to assure residents of 
their food requirements which 
the administration could not 
fully satisfy with weekly ration 
of imported rice and canned 
goods. 

Chickens, eggs, vegetables 
and fruits topped the list of 
foodstuffs entering the city, ac- 
cording to the EC A, Fresh and 
dried fish were also being 
brought here in greater volume 
together with various house- 
hold articles. 

Other foodstuffs coming to 
the city from the provinces in- 
cluded bananas, mangoes, avo- 
cado, pineapples, coconuts, pea- 
nuts, cattle and pigs.

Fighter Plane 
Offensive on 
Japan Mapped 

I WO JIM A— America's long 
range fighter planes "are going 
to make everybody in Japan 
feel war/' Brig. Gen. Ernest 
Moore, heading the Seventh 
Fighter Command, declared yes- 
terday, adding: 

"Take Japanese towns of 
10,000 to 12,000 population, or 
less, and imagine what happens 
if enemy fighters — ours— hit 
them every day, There will be 
pressure from all over Japan to 
quit the war." 

Moore's Seventh Fighter 
Command Mustangs fly almost 
continuously over the enemy 
homeland. 

Commenting on the recent fail- 
ure of the Japs to put fighters 
in the air against American at- 
tacks, Moore said he believed 
the Japs had a reasonable num- 
ber of planes but that they can- 
not get parte because of E-29 
attacks on aircraft plants*

the President for a more rigid 
enforcement of the executive 
order limiting the increase of 
rentals to not more than 125 
percent of the pre-war level. 

It was pointed out in the pe-

tasted the solution, he found it 
palatable. His nephew, Zamora, 
partook of the first mixture, he 
said. 

The next day he got more al- 
cohol and prepared a similar 
mixture. This time other rela- 
tives and neighbors joined in 
drinking his concoction. The fol- 
lowing day all felt sick and at 
least six were taken to the hos- 
pital for treatment. 

Three of the victims, Armando 
Godoy, Alberto Domingo and 
Adriano Buenaventura were 
later sent home after treatment 
but three others were so badly 
poisoned that Zamora died Sat- 
urday and Fuentecilla developed 
blindness* 

Police stated Tamayo will be 
charged with homicide through 
reckless imprudence for the 
death of Zamora,

More than 150 Liberators, 
Mitchells, and A-26 Invader 
attack bombers of General 
MacArthur's Far East Air 
Forces, protected by a cover 
of 50 Thunderbolt fighters, 
Tuesday made the first 
large scale attack of the war 
on the important Jap-held 
port of Shanghai where 
they seriously damaged the 
airfields and harbor. 

Detailed results of the bomb- 
ing were not observed due to 
the thick weather but all bombs 
were seen to fall in the target 
area. Today's communique 
from General MacArthur's 
headquarters also revealed that 
for the second consecutive day 
units of FEAF were over the 
mainland island of Kyushu. In 
one of the most strategically 
important strikes of the day 30 
Thunderbolts sealed off two 
tunnels northwest and south- 
west of the port of Kagoshima 
on the southwest tip of Kyushu. 

Ml railroad traffic to Ka-

PHILIPPINES NEED TRADE 

The following editorial Is reprinted from the St, Louis, 
Globe Democrat: 



Mi 



The 



Philippic Islands have been liberated from Japanese 
domination but it will be a -long time before they are freed 
from results of Japanese exploitation. The islands' most pres- 
sing needs are reconstruction and strong trade ties with the 
UnHed States. Both are deeply intertwined. Already limited 
commercial ship service has been restored to the Philippines 
from Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf ports. But this flow will be 
meager for some time. Before tt can assume proportions to 
bring anything like prosperity to Filipinos, much reconstruction 
must be accomplished, * And this in turn will depend largely 
upon what sort of trade arrangements Washington will afford 
an independent Philippine nation. Sound rehabilitation of that 
country demands a sound future economy which is based ex- 
tensively upon Philippine commerce* 

If. when Filipinos obtain full independence their exports to 
this country must pay our full tarriffs, trade and industry in the 
islands will be crippled. 

Free trade with the United States brought $90,000,000 of

stripped certainly to a major extent from the islands' commerce

BREMEN— U. S. Army and 
Navy technicians are examin- 
ing German military inven- 
tions, including a controlled 
weapon which pursues enemy 
planes, it was disclosed here. 
Monday. 

Army ordnance officers 
have been confronted with 
a whole series of wire-con- 
trolled weapons, from a 
clumsy "Goliath," which 
failed in Italy and Russia to 
a high velocity shell, attached 
to 18,000 feet of wire which 
literally can pursue its tar- 



The Germans worked on 
wire-controlled weapons 



because of swift British- 
American success in counter* 
ing radio-activated devices. 
Wire-controlled ' weapons are 
comparatively free from 
enemy interference. 

Despite failure of the "Go- 
liath" — an explosive-laden 
robot tank — the Germans 
seemingly weri convinced 
the principle was sound. 

Anti-aircraft shells, at- 
tached to lengths of wire, 
have been found, all of small 
calibre, which can be fired 
from the ground or from 
planes. 

An expert manipulator was 
discovered capable of sending 



shells from a plane toward 
an enemy aircraft and which 
could counter all evasive ac- 
tions. The plane-borne shell, 
Gei m rnan blueprints revealed, 
was expected to be particu- 
larly effective against tanks. 

In attacking a tank, air* 
craft usually first pass above 
a. vehicle to be sure of its 
identity. Then they make an 
extremely dangerous return 
attack, with the tank's guns 
waiting for them. The Ger- 
man "X-shell" i s fired back- 
wards from the plane after it 
has passed above the tank, 
making a dangerous second 
Pass unnecessary.

"What is still more import-

can and British heavy bombing 
teamwork which figured so 
largely in bringing Germany to 
its knees, a press dispatch dis- 
closed yesterday. 

Even while British naval car- 
rier planes operated with U. S. 
Third Fleet fliers in pounding 
the Tokyo area this week, air 
officials of the two nations 
studied a prospective tie-up of 
big British bombers with 
American Super Fortresses in 
strikes at Japan. 

Completion of the conferen- 
ces between Lt. Gen. Barney M. 
Giles, deputy commander of the 
U. S. Army Strategic Air Forces 
and British Air Marshal, Sir 
Hugh Lloyd, was announced 
Wednesday. 

Should the British put a force 
of bombers into the Pacific war, 
it would make a total of at 
least 10 allied tactical and stra- 
tegic air groups already attack- 
ing the Jap homeland, or pre- 
paring to do so.

U-Boat Sightings 

BUENOS AIRES— Argentine

boat surrendered at Mar del 
Plata. 

The British Admiralty prev- 
iously said four German sub- 
marines had not been accounted 
for. Editor of the Argentine 
newspaper El Tribuno of Dolo- 
res near the Atlantic coast told 
the Associated Press there was 
no doubt two submarines were 
sighted by more than 100 people 
shortly before noon Wednesday.

announced that "rockets are go- 
ing to be stepped up to two and 
a half times to day's production

steeply rising schedule," he 
said.

GUAM — A security blackout veiled operation of the 
great combined American and British battle fleet in 
Japanese home waters yesterday, following week-long 
bombardment by surface craft and carrier-based planes 
of vital enemy centers on Honshu and Hokkaido, 

Admiral Chester W. Nimitz limited yesterday's an- 
nouncement of naval action to harassing aerial opera- 
tions in which 11 cargo ships were sunk and five dam- 
aged in waters off Korea and Honshu Wednesday.

Juan Is Silent on 
Franco King Plan 

BERN, SWITZERLAND — 
Prince Juan of Spain, exiled son 
of Alfonso the Thirteenth, made 
no comment yesterday as Gen- 
eralissimo Franco tried in Mad- 
rid to return Spain to a mo- 
narchic! farm of government. 

However, the Bourbon Prince 
previously has said that if he 
should become king he would 
seek a political constitution by 
popular vote, protection of in- 
dividual rights and political lib- 
erties, popular legislative as- 
sembly, and elimination of un- 
just socia l conditions. 



-® McNutt said he was here "by 
direction of the President" and 
would make reports to the 
President on what he saw and 
heard here. He said he was 
here as "an observer." 

McNutt scotched the sugges- 
tion he would return to the 
Philippines in some high post, 
saying his work here was done 
when he left the high commit 
sionership in 1939, after having 
Ailed that post two years. 

The forceful war manpower 
commissioner refused 1 to be 
drawn into a discussion of the 
independence question. He s&id: 
"The word has been given and 
it will be kept." 

He said he was here "to be 
of help" and would be in the 
Philippines as long as it was 
necessary. He was particular- 
ly interested to see what could 
be done in matters affecting 
public health. He also wanted 
to know how much could be al- 
lotted to the Philippines out of 
private funds raised in the 
United States* for relief. 

In Honolulu, McNutt picked 
up Walter Dillingham, who is 
interested in getting Filipino 
laborers for Hawaii. McNutt 
said he wanted to find out 
whether these laborers could be 
spared here,

Drop 4,000 Tons 
On Four Cities 
In Night Attack 

GUAM— A record-break- 
ing force of more than 600 
Super Fortresses, following 
up the greatest fleet surface 
and air bombardment in 
history, dropped almost 
4,000 tons of incendiary 
bombs on four industrial 
Honshu cities before dawn 
yesterday, 21st Bomber 
Command headquarters in 
the Marianas announced. 

Yesterday morning's targets 
were Hitachi, Choshu Fukui 
and Okazaki, raising to 46 the 
total of Japanese industrial 
centers attacked in the latest 
Super Fort campaign. In ad- 
dition, the Nippon Oil Compa- 
ny's refinery north of Osaka 
also was hit, making the 10th 
oil center marked for fire bomb 
destruction. 

Returning crewmen said 
raging fires were started in 
all four cities. Fires visible

Concentrate on Jap Defeat, Not 
Surrender, Chinese Envoy Urges 



WASHINGTON — Dr. Wei 
Tao-Ming, Chinese ambas- 
sador to the United States, 
when asked about reports of 
Japanese peace feelers, yes- 
Wdav declared "I think we 
should concentrate on defeat- 
ing Japan, rather than to 
figure out a surrender for 
japan/' 



The Chinese envoy was 
questioned after he had con* 
ferred with Acting Secretary 
of State Joseph C. Grew. 

One correspondent asked 
whether Dr. Wei meant that 
the road to victory against 
Japan was military and not 
diplomatic, he replied: 



"Yes, why should we make 
it easier for Japan, by figur- 
ing out a way for her?** 

Asked concerning reports 
Madame Chiang would leave 
the United States soon for 
China, Dr. Wei said lie had 
no comment, but that Ma- 
dame Cbiang had recovered 
from her recent illness.

■NfcWS hUK I HE PROVINCES 

Beginning today, 5,000 copies of the Manila Free Philip- 
pines will be mailed by courtesy of the Bureau of Posts to post- 
offices on Luzon, Samar, Leyte, Marinduque, Masbate, Mindoro, 
and Palawan provinces. 

It will be the policy of the United States Information 
Service to increase distribution of this paper to those cities and 
areas In the war-devastated Philippines where no local news- 
paper facilities or information are available. 

For -Hiree years, the Philippines was compelled to live in a 
news blackout imposed by a ruthless military oppressor bent on 
world conquest. It had to be thus. For the suppression of 
truth is a fundamental tenet of totalitarian government, whether 
engineered by Japanese war lords, or their counterparts in 
Germany and Italy. Fascism cannot exist in a society which has 
free access to news. 

News and information, undistorted and truth-seeking, were 
among the gifts which liberating American armies brought to the 
Philippines. News in itself is perhaps one of the greatest gifts 
of all. As General MacArthur once put it, ''news to the soldier 
is as important as bread end bullets." It is no less important to 
civilian populations. 

To news-starved residents of distant barrios, who have been 
virtually isolated from the outside world for three years, and 
intentionally isolated by the Japanese from their neighbors in 
other islands of the Philippines, the Manila Free Philippines aims 
to f'lHhis still unserved role, until normal informational facilities 
c^r, be restored through private channels. 



Holland Asks for Juvenile Court 



Manila Chief of Police J. P.<^ 
Holland has recommended to 
the department of interior the 
establishment of a juvenile 
court to speed up the disposi- 
tion of cases involving juvenile 
delinquents now piling up in 
the city courts. 

Col. Holland told the depart- 
ment that frequently minors 
stayed in jail for weeks with- 
out any action taken unless 
relatives take the initiative. 
He said during the period from 
June 15 to June 30 some 180 
minors were arrested in the 
city and on July 5 there were 
62 juvenile cases pending in 
court. The rate of arrests has 
gone up this month, he added.

Russian Paper 
Cites Peace 
Goal in Meet 

MOSCOW— The high goals of 
"a secure and lasting peace 
based on friendship and 
justice," can be attained at the 
Potsdam conference, Red Star, 
the official Soviet Army news- 
paper declared Thursday. 

Governments of the Soviet 
Union, Great Britain and the 
United States should be able to 
cooperate closely to achieve 
these goals, the paper said. 

"Everything depends on 
mutual understanding and 
agreement on all the questions 
at hand at Potsdam, as well as 
a sober approach towatfi the 
vital changes in the life of 
Europe resulting from the de- 
feat of the Fascist hordes. 

"The solution of the prob- 
lems of Potsdam will decide 
whether humanity will inherit 
and secure a lasting peace 
based on friendship and jus- 
tice." 

Over Million Shells

lery shells at the Japanese in 
82 days of the Okinawa cam- 
paign, Col. Edmund B. Ed-

10th Army, announced yester- 
day. 

This figure was exclusive of 
rifle, machinegun, grenade, and 
mortar fire, and does not include 
the thousands of tons of naval 
shells poured into the islands. 

The Japanese fired 100,000 
rounds or approximately six 
percent of the American total. 
Great quantities of the Jap- 
anese artillery shells hurled in 
this- effort previously were 
spoiled in damp caves, Edwards

set off a series of tremendous 
blasts that shook this area. 
Twelve persons were known to 
nave been injured, and one was 
missing. 

Four terrific explosions rocked 
the foundations of every build- 
ing for miles around, shattering 
glass from hundreds of win- 
^k^u^* littering the streets 
ot both Halifax and Dartmouth. 
*ire shot 150 feet in the air

drumfire. 

About 10,000 persons were 
evacuated from their homes in 
the danger zon£ when the main 
magazine in the naval arma- 
ment depot was threatened. 

Street lights were cut off by 
the blasts but the night sky was 
brilliant with flashes and flames. 

It recalled the 1919 disaster 
when the French ammunition

half of Halifax was leveled or 
burned and 1,600 persons were 
killed. 



Enables Manila to Serve

As the United Nations marshal forces i

ZSSSZ Soever before witnessed | 

hlSt °mt t the port of Manila is playing a i 
rf. I^sal %b of keeping General MacAi 
forces supPlS with all the necessary eq„ 
supplies c P a P n not be deni ed. And strange 
seem Manila, prepared forO- 
just an emergency long 
before anybody dreamed 
about the present global 
conflict. 

The idea for the expansion of 
Manila's ptfrt facilities was in- 
corporated in the original dev- 
elopment plans for the city of 
Manila more than 35 years ago 
by the great American architect, 
Daniel H. Burnham. But plans 
remained in musty files yntil 
about three years prior to the 
outbreak of hostilities m the 
Pacific. 

In 1&39, in spite of the fact 
that Manila's Pier 7, then was 
one of the longest piers in the 
world, the need for more and 
better docking facilities began 
to assert itself. The reclamation 
of the north port area, which 
is now handling as much if not 
more traffic as the south har- 
bor, was started after the Com- 
monwealth national assembly 
had authorized an initial outlay 
of P2,500,000.00 An additional 
P500,000.00 was later appro- 
priated for construction of 
breakwaters necessary to pro- 
tect the new harbor. 

Material for the reclamation 
process was supplied by what 
was dredged in the "basin" and 
in the approach channels to the 
new harbor. To protect the har- 
bor from rapid silting and from 
bad weather, a breakwater mea- 
suring more than two miles was 
constructed; The Manila north 
harbor plans called for the con- 
struction of 12 piers with an ag- 
gregate total of some 7,500 me- 
ters of berths, of which 1,600 
meters were for ocean-going 
liners. This immense berthing 
space is now handling the major 
bulk of the present supply 
traffic in the Pacific. 

As planned by the American 
dreamer, Burnham, the entire 
dock area was to be served with 
rail and motor service. Al- 
though these plans were not vet 
fully achieved when the war 
broke out and Uncle Sam's forces 
driven from the islands, the un- 
tinished job nevertheless provid- 
ed ample groundwork for the 
extensive development of the 
nort even while the wreckage of 
Japanese shipping in the bay 
was being cleared.

People's Council 
Asks Chungking, 
Yeu an Harmony 

CHUNGKING— The People's Political 
Council yesterday urged the national gov- 
ernment to establish unity with the 
Chinese Communists and inaugurate 
freedom of speech and the press, a news 
dispatch declared yesterday. 

Some 170 council members called on 
the government to "force unity with the 
Yenan Communists before the convening 
of the national assembly." 

They also urged other political parties 
be given a legal status and that the peo- 
ple's election machinery be organized by 
districts and provinces. 

Nearing end of its two-week session, 
the council authorized the government to 
determine when the people's assembly 
should convene to frame the Chinese 
constitution. 

The council abstained from recom- 
mending the date, leaving the possibility 
that the constitutional convention, tenta- 
tively set by the Kuomintang congress for 
November, might be postponed. 

During the discussion on the constitu- 
tional convention, council members 
argued strongly against calling it in Nov- 
ember but there was no outright petition 
of the Kuomintang under discussion. 

Premier T. V. Soong will appear be- 
fore the closing meeting of the council 
today and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek 
will deliver a speech to the group.

Essential Drivers 
Only to Get Cars 

WASHINGTON— The initial 
sales of new 1945 automobiles 
will be limited to "essential

Administration announced yes- 
terday. 

These are the same drivers 
who have been eligible for 1942 
models, the last produced be 
fore war demands pushed auto- 
mobiles from the assembly lines. 

Eligibility lists for 1945 mo- 
dels will be expanded as rapidly 
as production and supply per- 
mits, Max McCullough, OPA 
rationing chief, declared. 

Those eligible to draw new 
cars include: law enforcement 
and other authorities, mailmen, 
physicians, surgeons, licensed 
veterinarians, ministers, mem- 
bers of the armed forces or 
state military officials "for of- 
ficial business only," taxicab

Chinese Retake Main Enemy 
Base in Central Chekiang 

CHUNGKING — Chinese troops on July 5 recap-

about 55 miles south of Hangchow, main enemv base in 
central Ch ekiang province, the Chinese High Command 

-^said Thursday. 



Drop 4,000 Tons . . . 

(Continued from Front Page) 

This war production center, 
some 78 miles north of Tokyo, 
houses electrical equipment, 
machine tool, aircraft parts, 
tank and locomotive plants. 

Fukui is the prefectural cap- 
ital, an important industrial 
and rail center 45 miles south- 
west of Kanazawa. 

Okazaki is the old and in- 
flammable industrial suburb 
southeast of Nagoya, producing 
aircraft parts, ordnance elec- 
trical equipment and light 
metal parts, as well as the site 
of hundreds of small backyard 
industries. 

The Amagasaki branch of the 
Nippon oil company on which 
Super Forts dropped high ex- 
plosives, is considered the most 
important refinery - in the 
Osaka area. 



It was also reported Chinese 
forces from Pukiang were me- 
nacing a stretch of the Che- 
kiang-Kiangsi railroad operated 
by the Japanese south of Hang- 
chow, and recaptured a point 
15 miles northwest of Kweilin 
in northeast Kwangsi province. 

Kweilin was the largest of 12 
American air bases overrun by 
the Japs last November, six of 
which have already been re- 
covered. The Chinese were dev- 
eloping a pincers drive on the 
air base city along a subsidiary 
route from Liuchow to Kwa- 
Kweilin. bypassing enemy-held 
Hsiuje Nhsien. 

In a renewal of fighting on 
tl\e Indo-China frontier, the 
High Command reported Chinese 
forces drove about 1,300 Jap 
troops back across the border 
after the enemy had launched 
three counter-attacks within 
two days. 



"There was a few seconds 
wait. Then the overcast skies 
off Tokyo split open in living 
flames as our naval guns 
crashed forth their first salvo 
and red hot clusters of shells 
plunged toward Japan's sacred 
soil. 

"T h e bombardment of 
Tokyo's front yard had be- 
gun. At six minutes past 
midnight when the bombard- 
ment ended, the U. S. war- 
ships turned back toward the 
sea off Choshi Point, only 35 
miles from the Japanese 
capital. 

"We fired full nine-gun sal- 
vos, and the battleships shiver- 
ed mightily and slid sideways 
more than a yard in the water 
with the recoil. 

"The glare of belching flames 
from scores of guns turned 
night into day, momentarily, 
before darkness closed in once 
more. Again and again* the 
naval broadsides, totaling near- 
ly 2,000 tons, shattered the si- 
lence and the blackness as the 
bombardment mounted in fury. 
"Like the previous two 
bombardments of the Jap- 
anese coast, this assault was 
strategic in nature. Hitachi 
is a network of heavy indus- 
try, stretching from that city 
to Tokyo. It is sprinkled 
with steel forges, munition 
plants and engineering fac- 
tories, furnishing a livelihood 
for a greater part of its esti- 
mated 500,000 people. 
"Here, the basic raw mate- 
rial from the mountains beside 
the coast line — particularly 
copper — are turned into finished 
products for Japan's war 
machine. 

Yet an amazing fact is that 
not once during the 51 minutes, 
of bombardment — nor up to the* 
moment of this writing several 
hours later — did the Japanese 
interpose a challenge. 

"Said one enlisted navy man: 
'Why, I just can't understand 
it. They didn't even send out 
a rowboat against us.' "

DANGEROUS THINKING 

Within the past week or two, considerable loose talk of 
peace between the United Nations and Japan has been kicking 
around. Some newspaper statements have gone so far as to 
outline sketchily peace terms which the United States supposedly 
would exact from Japan. In most instances, these reports are 
attributed to "informed sources," and draped with a semi- 
official cloak. 

Knowingly or not, those giving currency to this sort of think- 
ing are aiding and abetting a carefully contrived Japanese 
"peace offensive." This kind of thinking is dangerous. These 
rumors should be squelched and p'nned down to their source — 
the propaganda mills of Tokyo. 

There is no use denying that there are elements within the 
United Nations who would buy peace at any price. They are 
the war-weary, the misguided, or the seil-out crowd. They have 
lost sight of the reason for which the war was fought, or never 
had it in the first place. To these elements, clever Japanese 
propagandists have appealed in order to split public thinking 
slow down America's war effort, dull her incentive to win. 

To discuss peace now between Japan and the United States 
on any other terms but unconditional surrender is unthinkable. 
There are too many American graves sprinkled from Kwajalein 
to the Philippines, too many families broken up, too many homes 
destroyed, too many millions expended, too many hours of toil 
spent, too many plans for a better world charted. 

Today, in the summer of 1945, let those who would toy with 
the idea of a negotiated peace ask, who is winning the war? 
For whose benefit would peace on terms short of unconditional 
surrender redound? Who would gain by leaving intact Japan's 
internal structure, her feudalism, her suppression of thought, 
her power to wage another war? 

Let them ask, Why should the United States, after battling 
for four long years to the threshold of victory, pause to bargain 
with a bleeding, battered enemy whose bargaining power has 
been shorn? 

There is no back-alley to victory — real victory. The road 
to lasting peace must continue tortuous. 

To the mongers of peace feelers and peace rumors, there 
can only be one answer, an answer expressed last week by Act- 
ing Secretary of State Joseph C. Grew in these words: 

"Japanese militarism must and will be crushed. The policy 
of ihk government has been, is, and will continue to be uncon- 
ditional surrender."

Romulo Urges 
More Payments 

WASHINGTON — Payment 
of $100,000,000 by the U. S. 
government to cover all war 
damage to private property 
in the Philippines would be 
"not nearly enough," Brig. 
Gen. Carlos P. Romulo, Phil- 
ippines resident commission- 
er, declared yesterday. 

Romulo said he "welcomed" 
U. S. Senator Millard Tyd-

Matson Plans 
To Hike Fleet 

SAN FRANCISCO — Plans 
for a greatly expanded freight 
service between Hawaii and 
continental U. S. ports were 
announced Friday by the Mat- 
son Navigation company which 
disclosed transit between Ha- 
waii and California ports would 
be cut to five-and-a-half days 
from seven before the war. 

The company will also cut 
transit time from Hawaii to 
Pacific northwest ports to six 
days as compared to the 11 
days of pre-war shipping. 

Matson also will have direct 

eekly sailings from Atlantic 
and Gulf Coast ports to Hawaii 
in conjunction with the Isth- 
mian Steamship Company, en- 
abling reduction in the Atlantic 
run from 30 to 17 days. 



P. I. Division Will 
Train at Tagaytay 

Tagaytay, pre-war cadre for 
Philippine Army trainees in 
Cavite, has been allocated to 
the Philippine Overseas Divi- 
sion as a training site, it was 
disclosed yesterday by Maj. 
Gen. Basilio Valdes, Philippine 
Army chief of staff. 

The Philippine Overseas Di- 
vision, which is slated to take 
an active part in the invasion 
of Japan is in process of orga- 
nization. The officers and men 
to compose this division will be 
given specialized training at 
Tagaytay, as soon as training 
facilities are built, Valdes said. 



Protests Against 
Guerrilla Recruiting 

Gov, Juan O. Chioco of Nue- 
va Ecija, in a communication 
received yesterday by the de- 
partment of the interior, re- 
ported that guerrilla officers 
are going around in his pro- 
vince enlisting men to join 
their organizations. 

He requested the interior de- 
partment to put a stop to this 
practice as young men were 
forced to abandon their farm 
work in some instances. 



He said "millions °f Ameri- 
cans in the eastern half ot tfte 
nation will have to keep warm 
on 50 percent of the coal and 
coke normally burned and they 
cannot expect more than tnree 
gallons for every four normally 
consumed. " 

The solid fuels administrator 
stressing that the U. . S . fuel 
shortage is close y related to the 
European situation, said that 
"list estimates indicate tnaf 
Eu fope will be 25,000,000 tons 
short of coal that it needs be- 
tween now and next April. 
"I do not want it ever to be 
said Americans liked their 
comforts so much that they 
did not lift a finger to shield 
the brave men and women 01 
the devastated countries of 
our Allies from the marrow- 
chilling ordeal that faces 
them this winter. We can- 
not expect a friendly hand- 
shake from hands swollen 
with chilblains," he said. 

Ultimately Europe's coal prob- 
lem will be solved by Europe, 
and the mines of Europe can 
be restored to working order 
with "little or no outside help," 
he said. But it cannot be done 
over night, "and until it can 
be accomplished America must 
help." 



8,700 Crime Cases 
Probed to Date 

Some 8,700 criminal cases 
have been investigated by the 
Meisic Branch of the city 
fiscal's office from the first 
week of last March to July 20, 
according to official figures. In 
the main office at the old Cen 
tral Hotel, more than 2,000 
cases had been disposed of dur 
ing the same period. These 
figures do not include cases of 
juvenile offenders. 

Records further disclosed 
that theft, robbery, possession 
of Army property and illegal 
possession of firearms formed 
bulk of cases investigated. In 
the case of illegal possession of 
firearms, a city prosecuting at- 
torney declared last week that 
in the majority of cases, the 
gun toters not infrequently tell 
the police they- are guerrillas.

BERLIN — The Russians ye < 
terday were praised for the 
cooperation and fair dealing j

"To the Russians, business j 
business and they are seriou

around any bush. The Rus- 
sians analyze point by poini 
and decide what position the} 
are going to take. When the 
conference begins, they state 
their case and their opinions. 

"That does not mean they 
have made up their minds be- 
fore they sit down. It does 
mean that everyone else at the 
conference has to, know his 
stuff and be able to present his 
case as thoroughly as the Rus- 
sians."

WASHINGTON— Industrialist Henry J. Kaiser has* 
prepared a bill calling for nationwide voluntary prepaid 
medical care which would be introduced in Congress by 
Sen, Claude Pepper, Democrat of Florida, it was an- 
nounced here Friday. 

Kaiser's bill, based on experience in providing 
group health insurance monthly to 125,000 employes of 
his enterprises, would permit establishment of group 
medical facilities through the Federal Housing* Adminis- 
tration, which insures home mortgages made by private 

"^financing institutions. 

Kaiser empjiasized his pro- 
ject was not "socialized medi- 
cine in the sense of a social 
experiment" but provided a 
"method for stabilizing and 
rationalizing the economics of 
medical practice within a sys- 
tem of free enterprise." 

The principal points in Kai- 
ser's bill were: 

1 — F inancial assistance 
through bank loans to groups 
interested in setting up facili- 
ties for prepaid medical care, 

2— Technical assistance to 
FHA by the U. S, Public Health 
Service. 

3 — Limitations on FHA's ad- 
ministrators' jurisdiction con- 
cerning control and supervision 
of such facilities, except for 
those provided by law, 
. 4 — Preferential use of exist- 
ing private or public facilities.

GUAM— Nearly 100 Super Fortress bombers from 
the Marianas struck at the Ube coal liquefaction plant 
on the southern tip of Honshu early yesterday morning, 
press dispatches from Guam reported. 

Close to 500 tons of demolition bombs were dropped 
in the latest attack, which was carried out from medium 
altitude. It marked the 11th Japanese oil plant at- 
tacked in the Super Fort campaign against Japanese 
homeland fuel installations.^ 

The Ube coal liquefaction 
plant was one of the largest in 
Japan. It produces synthetic 
oil, especially important to the 
Japanese war machine because 
of difficulties now encountered 
in bringing oil from Indonesian 
and southern regions. 

Target area of yesterday's at- 
tack, according to dispatches, 
covered over 6,300,000 square 
feet The plant was constructed 
on reclaimed land on the water- 
front adjacent to the mouth ot 
the Kato River. Ube is an indus- 
trial and coal center with a po- 
pulation of 100,000. The city 
was hit by firebombs on July

Navy Also Reveals 63 Ships, 
110 Planes Blasted Last Week 

GUAM — American Third Fleet light units smashed 
a four-ship Japanese convoy off the entrance to Tokyo 
Bay yesterday morning and bombarded Chichi Jima in 
the Bonins, 550 miles to the south, Fleet Admiral Ches- 
ter W. Nimitz revealed yesterday. 

At the same time, Nimitz listed 63 Japanese vessels 
sunk or damaged, 110 planes destroyed or crippled on 
the ground, and devastating blows on ground installa- 
tions — all in strikes against Japan between July 18-33 
by U. S. carrier- and land-based planes and British car- 

■f rier planes. Among the dam- 
aged vessels was a 32,000-ton 
battleship. 

Breaking a four-day silence 
on whereabouts of the U. S. 
Third Fleet and a carrier task 
force of the British Pacific 
Fleet, Admiral Nimitz said it 
had been operating directly off 
the east coast of the main Jap- 
anese island of Honshu. 

He credited light units with 
sinking two, probably sinking 
a third, and damaging a fourth 
of a four-ship convoy five 
miles west of Nojima Cape, 
which guards Tokyo Bay. Other 
light units simultaneously 
swung their guns on the town 
of Omura on Chichi Jima in the 
Bonins. No damage was suf- 
fered in either operation. 

Tabulating results of last 
week's series of strikes against 
the Tokyo area by U. S. and 
British carrier-borne planes, 
Nimitz revealed that Allied 
planes swept from Yokosuka 
naval base to Mito and Kiryu 
on the northern edge of the 
Kanto plain, and to a string of 
airfields above Tokyo. Targets 
included naval concentrations, 
ammunition dumps, railroad 
yards, hangars, oil tanks, and 
small industrial plants. 

At Yokosuka naval base 
American planes last Wednes- 
day sank a destroyer, one cable 
layer, three small cargo vessels 
and seven motor torpedo boats. 
The Japanese battleship hit 
was the Nagato which Ni- 
mitz described as "heavily 
damaged." The Nagato, one 
of Japan's four known re- 
maining battleships, is 26 
years old. Her super struc- 
ture was extensively dam- 
aged. Other ships damaged 
were a converted destroyer, 
an old destroyer, four lug- 
gers and two small craft. 
. In addition, they destroyed 
six locomotives, four hangars, 
one ammunition dump, an oil 
tank and a power plant trans- 
former and damaged railroad 
cars and turntables, many bar- 
racks and shops. American 
Planes destroyed 30 Japanese 
planes on the ground and dam- 
aged 42 others, while British 
carrier pilots destroyed 13 and

my freighters and damaging 
another in the Gulf of Siam. 
Others to the north sank a 
schooner, harassed harbor craft 
and bombed rail installations in 
French Indo-China. 

In the Balikpapan area Sat- 
urday night Australian forces 
advanced three miles north on 
a road leading inland from -Ba- 
likpapan to the oil fields, as the 
enemy withdrew from defense 
positions. 

Fighter units of the RAAF 
attacked the Sandakan area in 
northern Borneo, destroying or 
damaging military installations 
and motor transport and start- 
ing fires among storage facili- 
ties. 

PT boats attacked enemy 
bivouac areas in the Samarinda 
area. ,

Pope Praises 
U.N. Charter 

VATICAN CITY— Pope Pius 
12th has praised the United Na- 
tions charter as a "more effi- 
cient" instrument than the 
League of Nations, press dis- 
patches said yesterday* 

The pope made this statement 
in his study to a party of 
American newspaper and radio 
editors and writers. He told 
them that only through the dis- 
semination of truth can another 
"mass misfortune" such as a 
global conflict be avoided. 

"It is an invaluable service 
your profession offers to so- 
ciety, breaking down barriers of 
time and space and assisting air 
members of the vast human 
family to share their joys and 
sorrows, their triumphs and 
disasters, their hopes and fears," 
he said. 

Speaking with feeling of the 
late President Roosevelt with 
whom he corresponded frequent- 
ly, the pope said "we feel for 
Mr Truman similar affection 
and for all people of your great 
country-" - 



Art Treasures 
Are Returned 
To Italy Owners 

FLORENCE, ITALY— More 
than $-500,000,000 worth of art 
treasures, stolen by the Germans 
to swell collections of Hermann 
Goering and other high rank- 
ing Nazis, were returned here 
Sunday in 13 freight cars 
guarded by American military 
police* 

Among the paintings are 
works by Michael Angelo and 
Raphael, Donatello's "Saint 
George" and Eanaeh's "Adam 
and Eve/' The value of the art 
treasures was estimated by Lt 
Col. Ernest DeWald of the 
Allied Commission and Giovanni 
Poggi, supervisor of the two 
Florence galleries from which 
the treasures were stolen. 

Eleven paintings still are 
missing from the collection 
taken by the Germans from the 
Uffisi and Pitti palace galleries 
here. 

When the Allies threatened 
Florence, the Nazis dumped pic- 
tures and other works of art 
into trucks and fled to Bolzano 
where they ran out of gasoline* 

The trucks stood two days in 
the public square during the 
rain and Allied bombardment* 
Finally the Germans moved 
some of them to San Leonardo, 
about 40 miles from Bolzano 
and others to a prison camp 
about 60 miles northwest of 
Bolzano*

Starting next month the north 
branch of the Philippine General 
hospital on Calle Espafia, Sam-

Opium Board Charges Spain 
Violates Narcotic Traffic 

LONDON — Franco Spain has persistently ignored 
its obligations under the international convention to 
assist the Permanent Central Opium Board in efforts 
to control the international narcotics traffic, it was dis- 
closed yesterday in a delayed dispatch to the N. Y He- 
rald Tribune. 0- 



Spain not only neglected to 
file the requisite reports on nar- 
cotics with the board, but also 
constantly imported narcotic 
drugs in excess of quotas fixed 
for her, President Sir Atul 
Chatterjee declared at a recent 
board meeting. 

"Even before the war," Chat- 
terjee said, "we were not sa- 
tisfied with the way Spain 
carried out her obligations in 
view of the fact that she had 
ratified the 1925-1931 conven- 
tion on control of the narcotic 
traffic, 

"We have asked for explana- 
tions but in only one case have 
we had a reply, and it was un- 
satisfactory/ 1 Chatterjee de- 
clared.

BREST, FRANCE— France's 
"main task is to reconstruct" in 
order to fulfill her "present and

Gen, DeGaulJe said Sunday in 
a radio broadcast* 

DiBcussSng the coming Octo-

350 Planes Rock Shanghai, 
Blast 13 S hips, 45 Planes 

A record breaking flight of more than 350 Old- 
nawa-bascd bombers and fighters slashed at the 
Shanghai area Sunday, destroyed or damaged 13 
enemy ships, and an estimated 45 planes on the 
ground, General Mac Arthur announced this morning* 
An enemy destroyer, a 3,000- ton freighter-trans- 
port and a smaller freighter were definitely sunk. A 
destroyer escort, two sub-chasers and a 10,000-ton 
transport and six freighter-transports of 3,000 tons 
each were probably sunk, and numerous small craft 
were destroyed. 

Using everything from fragmentation to l T 000-pound bombs, 
Liberators, Mitchells and Invaders concentrated on Kiangwan, 
Taehang and Tinghai airfields in and around Shanghai, cater- 
ing runways and destroying buildings. Three large and several 
smaller fires were started at Kiangwan, the largest airfield in 
China, and capable of staging all enemy planes in China and 
Manchuria* Much of the shipping was caught in the Whangpoo

The city of Kure, with a pre- 
war population of £75,000 and 
one of the four largest naval 
yards in Japan, was capable of 
repairing warships and naval 
auxiliaries of all categories. 
Super Fortress fleets, how- 
ever, hit Kure July 2 and 
burned out 50 percent of the 
built-up area. Kure also was 
attacked by carrier planes 
last March when Admiral

24 ships, including 15 to 17

Yesterday's smash at Kure 
marked the first reappearance 
of Admiral Halscy's Third Fleet

when they attacked Yokosuka 
naval base and Tokyo areas. 
In that raid, they sank 12 ships

Army Helps Restore 
Philippine Industry 

The United States Army is doing everything pos- 
sible to develop Philippine natural resources, Lt Gen. 
W. D, Styer, commanding general AFWESPAC, told 
a press conference here yesterday. 

In addition to handling re-deployment of thousands 
of troops and millions of tons of supplies and equipment, 
the Army is engaged in a sweeping program to rehabili- 
tate Philippine industry, 



Pointing to urgent need for 
building materials, General 
Styer said two cement plants 
already were operating and 
lumber mills were being re- 
equipped rapidly as possible. In 
addition, the Army planned to 
rehabilitate other' civilian mills 
and to aid in rebuilding the 
hump and copra industries, Cor- 
dage, edible oils and fats, soap 
and rattan furniture are a few 
of the badly needed manufac- 



tured items that could be pro- 
duced in the Philippines, saving 
time and valuable shipping 
space, he said. 

Some products of Philippine 
production will be available im- 
mediately to civilians, General 
Styer said. Army materials 
are furnished where necessary, 
and equipment is supplied to put 
damaged factories back into 
operation under Army contract

MANILA

Unit 



Like an intricate jigsaw puzzle, with each piece so seemingly 
unrelated at the start, yet fitting together so neatly and com- 
pletely at the finish to make a work of art, that is the way 
the master plan of strategy to defeat Japan is unfolding in 
recent weeks. 

Perhaps the best evidence of the result of this long-range 
blueprint for American victory came out of Japan last weeK, 
when the greatest naval force in history combed the skies over 
the homeland and ranged the coastlines without meeting inter- 
ference. A War Department spokesman suggests the reason 
why Japan's air force refused to meet this challenge was because 
of fuel shortages in the homeland. This was no accident. 
The situation was brought about through a calculated campaign 
that encompassed three phases: 

1 — Air and sea attrition of Japan's tanker fleet. . • 

2 — Bombardment of Japan's source of supply. 

3 — Invasion and seizure of key oil fields. 

For four long years, lonely American submarines have 
been plying Japan's sea lanes, paying particular attention to 
tankers. The same* is true of the air fleets of General Mac- 
Arthur, Admiral Nimitz, and those based in China. So success- 
ful has this campaign been that today, the story from submarine 
headquarters, and from air force commands is that there are 
no more targets to sight. 

The second phase was initiated and carried through sys- 
tematically by the first air forces based in New Guinea, which 
flew through all sorts of handicaps of weather and distance 
to smash at Japan's stolen oil fields in Borneo and elsewhere 
in the East Indies. The campaign reached its height when 
American troops liberated the Philippines, enabling new 
blows to be struck from shorter distances, and paving the way 
for the third phase, now being conducted by Dutch and Aus- 
tralian troops in three sections of the oil-rich island of Borneo. 

Today, no oil from Tarakan, Brunei Bay or Balikpapan flows 
into the yawning holds of Japanese tankers. These fields are 
in Allied hands, and within months, this oil will probably power 
many of the invasion craft, planes, warships and trucks that 
participate in the final assaults. 

There is yet a fourth phase to this strategic battle of oil. 
At present it is being conducted by B-29 fleets from the 
Marianas. It is the last step in a coordinated campaign to 
cripple Japan's war potential. Early Monday, some 100 of 
the giant bombers struck at the Ube coal liquefaction plant 
on Honshu— one of the largest in Japan. Its function is to 
produce synthetic" oil. Just as it was no accident that Jap- 
anese planes lacked fuel to rise from the ground last week, it 
was no accident that Ube happened to be the llth Japanese 
I plant smashed by Super Forts since the first of the year. 
Today, the last bits are falling into place in the mosaic 
of victory which began as far back as the Coral Sea. Every 
bomb, every bullet, every step of an infantryman's march, every 
turn of a warship's propeller, and every bubbling wake of a 
torpedo has played its part. _ 



B-29's Cripple 
Oil Refinery 

GUAM— "Excellent- results" 
were obtained by B-29's parti r 
cipating in the demolition bomb- 
ing attack against the Ube Coal 
Liquefaction Company at the 
extreme southwestern end of 
Honshu, returning pilots re- 
ported yesterday. 

Pilots said results ranged 
from "unobserved to excellent 
as planes struck through the 

clouds. , ... . 

The attack was made without 
opposition and all planes re- 
turned safely. Anti-aircraft 
fire was light. 



Pays Tribute 
To Slain Yanks 

MALMEDY, BELGIUM — 
Charles Sawyer, U. S. Ambas-

murdered by the Nazis when 
he spoke from the site of a 
memorial chapel to be erected 
in the victims' memory. 

The soldiers, numbering 
more than 100, were brutally 
murdered on orders of an SS 
Panzer officer after they had 
been captured during the Nazi 
Ardennes offensive in 1944. 

Sawyer said he hoped the 
world would not forget the 
German atrocities.

Like an Intricate jigsaw puzzle, with each piece so seemingly 
_ated at the start, yet fitting together $o neatly and com- 
pletely at the finish to make a work of art, that is the way 
the master plan of strategy to defeat Japan Is unfolding in 
recent weeks. 

Perhaps the best evidence of the result of this long-range 
blueprint for American victory came out of Japan last week, 
when the greatest naval force in history combed the skies over 
the homeland and ranged the coastlines without meeting inter- 
ference. A War Department spokesman suggests the reason 
why Japan's air force refused to meet this challenge was because 
of fuel shortages in the homeland. This was no accident. 
The situation was brought about through a calculated campaign 
that encompassed three phases: 

1— Air and sea attrition of Japan's tanker fleet, * 

2 — Bombardment of Japan's source of supply* 

3 — Invasion an d seizure of key oil fields. 

For four long years, lonely American submarines have 
been plying Japan's sea lanes, paying particular attention to 
tankers. The same, Is true of the air fleets of General Mac- 
Arthur, Admiral Nimiti, and those based in China. So success- 
ful has this campaign been that today, the story from submarine 
headquarters, and from air force commands is that there are 
no more targets to sight. 

The second phase was initiated and carried through sys- 
tematically by the first air forces based in New Guinea, which 
flew through all sorts of handicaps of weather and distance 
to smash at Japan's stolen oil fields in Borneo and elsewhere 
in the East Indies, The campaign reached its height when 
American troops liberated the Philippines, enabling new 
blows to be struck from shorter distances, and paving the way 
for the third phase, now being conducted by Dutch and Aus- 
tralian troops in three sections of the oil-rich island of Borneo. 

Today, no oil from Tarakan, Brunei Bay or Balikpapan flows 
into the yawning holds of Japanese tankers. These fields are 
in Allied hands, and within months, this oil will probably power 
many of the invasion craft, planes, warships and trucks that 
participate in the final assaults. 

There is yet a fourth phase to this strategic battle ot oil. 
At present It is being conducted by B-29 fleets from the 
Marianas. It is the last step In a coordinated campaign to 
cripple Japan's war potential. Early Monday, some 100 of 
the giant bombers struck at the Ube coal liquefaction plant 
on Honshu— one of the largest in Japan, Its function is to 
produce synthetic' oil, Just as it was no accident that Jap- 
anese planes lacked fuel to rise from the ground last week, it 
was no accident that Ube happened to be the Hth Japanese 
oil plant smashed by Super Forts since the first of the year. 

Today, the last bits are falling into place in the mosaic 
of victory which began as far back as the Coral Sea. Every 
bomb, every bullet, every step of an infantryman's march, every 
turn of a warships propeller, and every bubbling wake ot a 
torpedo has played its part-

OS MEN A STUDIES HAWAII REQUEST 



Jap Leaders Know Nation 
Is Defeated, Says Barbey 

PORTLAND, ORE, — The Japanese are In a critic- 
al position "because Japanese leaders know they are de- 
feated and will have to decide what their country is to 
do," Vice Admiral Daniel Barbey, veteran of 56 opera- 
tions against the Japanese, declared yesterday* 

"The Japanese people might not realize they are de- 
feated, although they must see the uncertainty in their 
leaders 1 statements and the destruction of their cities," 
he added. 

Barbey, commander of the Seventh Amphibious 
Force, home on leave, discussed the invasion of the Japan- 
ese homeland and said the Invasion might be staged in 
China. 

"Invasion of the Japanese homeland is a certainty, 
but just which step it Is In the whole plan is a mystery," 
Barbey observed. 



Vinson Takes Oath as 
Secretary of Treasury 

WASHINGTON— Fred M. Vinson, former director 
of economic stabilization, yesterday took his oath of 
office as secretary of the Treasury before members of 
both houses of Congress and of the executive branches 
of government. 

He succeeded Henry J. Morgenthau, Jr : , in colorful 
ceremonies held in the ways and means committee cham- 
ber of the U. 5, House of Representatives. House 
Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas presided. 
_ " , - p. TTi i In his first address, Vinson 

Ex-U.S. Bund Head 
Commits Suicide 



WITH U.S. 7th AKMY, GER- 
MANY— Ludwig Kuehner, des- 
cribed by American officers as 
a former Milwaukee, Wis., Bund 
leader and espionage agent for 
the German consulate in Chi- 
cago, committed suicide shortly 
after his arrest a week ago, a 
news dispatch said yesterday* 

Kuehner ended his life in the 
Mosbach jail- In a signed state- 
ment he admitted he began 
spreading the Hitler doctrine 
in Milwaukee before 1939. 

He served in the German 
army in the last war, moved to 
Milwaukee in 1933, remaining 
there until the outbreak of war. 
Kuehner returned to Germany 
to become a lieutenant in the 
Nazi army. 



PRINCESS RETUKNS 

GOUROCK, SCOTLAND — 
Princess Juliana of Netherlands 
and her three small daughters 
arrived here yesterday aboard 
the Queen Mary, 



declared "there is much more 
to be done in stabilizing the 
economies of countries the 
world over. May I say that 
there can be no stable world 
economy without sound econo- 
my in \hn United States. I 
have no illusions as to the dif- 
ficult road ahead/ 1 

Citing the need for coopera- 
tion, Vinson called on the ''help 
of all branches of government 
and of the American people, 
for in the main, the job must 
be done by the people." 

At the close of his address, 
the large audience rose in ova- 
tion to the new secretary. 



KENNEY HONORED 

WASHINGTON — Gen. George 
C. Kenney, commander of Far 
East Air Forces, has been 
awarded a second Oak Leaf 
Cluster to the Distinguished 
Service Medal for "long-range 
planning and brilliant and dar- 
ing leadership," the War 
Department announced yester- 
day, . * 



McNutt's Job May 
Be Abolished m 
Cabinet Shuffle 

WASHINGTON— The Office 
of War Mobilization and Re- 
conversion is studying a pro- 
posal to create an 11th cabinet 
post— that of the department of' 
welfare and security, it was 
reported yesterday. 
Washington observers said this 
rendered uncertain future sta- 
tus of Paul V* McNutt, war 
manpower commissioner and 
director of the Federal Social 
Security Administration, now 
in Manila as a special represen- 
tative of President Truman, 

According to the plan, the 
new department would take 
over the functions of several 
agencies loosely attached to the 
security administration. Pos- 
sibly some of the war manpow- 
er commission's tasks would 
be transferred to the labor de- 
partment, 

President Truman's prefer- 
ence for cabinet members of 
his own choosing makes un- 
likely McNutt's selection for 
the new cabinet post, it was 
said. 



Retain Contends 
He Aided Allies 

PARIS— Marshal Henri Phil- 
ippe Petain, testifying yester- 
day, at the opening session of 
his trial, on charges of treason, 
contended his armistice with 
the Germans in 1940 saved 
France and aided an Allied vic- 
tory- 
Prosecutor Andre Mornet 
demanded the death penalty, 

Petain said he was "heir to 
an unprecedented catastrophe/' 
and that he had only carried 
out the advice of military lead- 
ers when he asked the Germans 
for an armistice, 

Paul Reynaud, French pre- 
mier when the Nazi tide was 
overrunning France, testifying 
for the prosecution, was the 
only other witness, 

Reynaud accused Petain of 
political lassitude and personal 
ambitions. He said both Petain 
and General Maxime Weygand 
were blinded by political 
hatreds and put every obstacle 
in his way to block plans for 
carrying on a fight against Ger- 
many from North Africa. 

Reynaud insisted this was "a 
trial of French honor." He said 
that up to the last moment the 
French Government had as- 
sured Prime Minister Churchill 
that Fiance would never sign 
a separate armistice with Ger- 
many. 



Flying Boxcars Soon Will Speed 
Freight, Even Tanks, to Pacific 

HA GERSTOWN, MD.— "Flying boxcars," huge new C-82 cargo planes now 
rolling oif assembly lines here, will shortly be speeding heavy freight, including 
light tanks, to the Pacific, according to an Army officer attached to a local plant. 



Designed as a cargo ship and 
transport for airborne infantry- 
men, the C-82 has 93 percent 
of the cubic capacity of a rail- 
road box-car carrying a maxi- 
mum load of nine tons. 



The planes have a range of 
up to 4,000 miles and a cruis- 
ing speed of better than 200 
miles an hour. 

Because of their level floors 
at truck bed height the trans- 
port's cargo, which will include 



trucks, and heavy artillery, can 
be loaded and unloaded rapidly. 

Many will 1 be used as evacua- 
tion planes on their return 
trips. Each can accommodate 
34 patients in litters. 



Dillingham In Manila 
To Secure 6,000 Men 

President Osmena is giving serious consideration to 
a request made by Hawaiian sugar interests to recruit 
Filipino laborers, Malacanan sources said yesterday. 

Walter Dillingham, prominent Hawaii industrial! r., 
is in Manila to try to secure 6,000 Filipino laborers. He 
is a member of the party of War Manpower Commis- 
sioner Paul V. McNutt, ^ 



McNutt told newsmen on his 
arrival in Manila last week 
Hawaii was faced with an acute 
labor crisis, and the United 
States as well as the Army was 
threatened with a sugar short- 
age. 

The Commonwealth govern- 
ment had previously refused to 
allow export of Filipino labor- 
ers to Hawaii. Presidential 
Secretary Jose 3. Reyes said it 
would be inadvisable to permit 
farmhands to leave the Phil- 
ippines at least until require- 
ments of the United States 
Army and Commonwealth war 
work and rehabilitation pro- 
jects had been met. 

This question is expected to 
figure prominently in forth- 
coming talks between McNutt 
and Filipino leaders. McNutt 
has said he would try to see if 
these laborers could be spared 
here. 



Army Helps • . . 

(Continued from Front Pose) 

Reviewing what he termed 
u one of the outstanding ad- 
vances in history" from Austra- 
lia to the Philippines, General 
Styer told of the tremendous 
supply problem which had been 
overcome by service units in 
the theater. Several million 
tons of equipment and sup- 
plies have been landed in 
the Philippines since D-Day, 
last October 20, During the 
months of July, August and 
September, several million more 
tons of supplies, and several 
hundred thousand troops will 
pour into the Philippines, more 
than doubling the present per- 
sonnel in AFWESPAC. 

Units comprising the Philip- 
pine Base Section are estab- 
lished in strategic areas from 
Zamboanga to Lingayen Gulf, 
forming a network of supply 
lines to units in every part of 
the Islands. Harbor works 
have been repaired and extend- 
ed and rail facilities have been 
put back into operation. The 
Port of Manila, nearly doub- 
ling its pre-war capacity, can 
berth 22 Liberty ships in South 
Harbor and four in North Har- 
bor. Rail lines have been put 
into operation into North Har- 
bor an4 win b$ extended to 
include South Harbor. 

General Styer ended his 
press conference with high 
praise for the unsung work of 
the Medical Corp, the Military 
Police and the service troops 
who work through mud, rain, 
and heat, often under enemy 
fire, with none of the headlines 
that go to combat units.

STANDING UP 

One of the big reasons why American troops of the Mac- 
Arthur command have been able to storm nearly 80 separate 
beachheads without initial opposition in the past three years of 
combat in the Southwest Pacific has been the masterful use of 
supporting airpower by land-based planes. 

Not once have the Japanese been able to pin down the first 
assault waves and block reinforcements and supplies from reach- 
ing shore. Behind this series of successes lies the deft touch of 
(General George C. Kenney, MacArthur's air chief and com- 
m'ander of the now expanded Far East Air Force. 

Wednesday night, at a special press conference in Manila, 
Gen. Kenney revealed that the world hasn't seen anything yet, 
in the way of air support for ground operations. Kenney didn't 
say where American troops would land next, but, he promised: 

"It'll be the biggest massing of airpower the world has 
eyer known. When we finish, the whole Japanese army will be 
immobilized. They will be bomb happy. The troops will have 
been stung by terrific blows from which they won't be able to 
recover. 

"And before our troops go in any place, there will not be 
a^bridge or a decent road left for enemy use. I expect our 
troops to go ashore anywhere we choose with an almost total 
lack of opposition. They will go in standing up." 

Gen. Kenney speaks now with more authority than at any 
other time in the war. The same air commander who worked 
with a pitiful handful of Liberators and P-40's in the early stages 
of the war to accomplish the miracles of Buna, Finschhafen and 
Lae, now counts 5,000 combat planes under his control. And 
th*e figure for all allied air forces in the Pacific will mount to 
1(3,000 after redeployment of air strength from the European 
theater is completed. 

To the men of the infantry — the men who must make the 
beachheads — Gen. Kenney's pledge that they will go in "stand- 
ing up" means more than words can convey. 

It means the same low rate of casualties which have marked 
each amphibious campaign under General MacArthur's com- 
mand, it means swifter attainment of objectives, and it means, 
in the final battles that are shaping, up, a quicker passage to 
home and a world once more at peace. 

Japan, faced with the prospect of 5,000 ton single as-, 
saults from the Okinawa bases of General Kenney's alone, can 
read only one message in General Kenney's pledge — the most 
terrible ordeal from air bombing that any nation has ever been 
called upon to face in the history of war. 



Japan Doomed and Navy Helpless 
Says Halsey; Pledges New Blowi 

ABOARD ADMIRAL HALSEY'S FLAGSHIP OFF JAPAN— "I said aft< 
the far-flung battle for Leyte Gulf that the Japanese fleet was routed, beate 
and broken and nothing has happened, since then, to change my opinion," At 
miral William F. Halsey declared Thursday as his Third Fleet struck at the Jap 
anese homeland for the 16th consecutive day. 

"What is left of the Japanese navy is helpless, but just for good luck w 
will hunt them out of their holes. 



"The enemy air force still has 
planes, and those planes, 
manned by suicide pilots, are 
capable of inflicting damage. 
But the combination of B-29's, 
ground power of Okinawa 
based air forces, and the ac- 
curacy of our carrier planes are 
reducing the enemy's air po- 
tential to that of a nuisance. 

"It can not and will not 
stop us. The Pacific Fleet is * 
striking, and will continue to 
strike with every weapon it 
has. Our big: guns inflicted 
tremendous damage on north- 
ern steel plants. Previously, 
these had been safe, even 
from B-29's. 

"Our light forces have pene- 
trated to the very entrance of 
Tokyo Bay, smashing and raid- 
ing coastal shipping lanes and 
shooting up all available coast- 
al targets. 

"In the northern part of the 
empire our carriers have al- 
ready wrought almost unbeliev- 
able destruction on enemy 
shipping, industry and trans- 
portation. 

"Radio Tokyo has told the 
Japanese people to save every- 
thing in order to resist the 
threatened invasion, and in the 
meantime to prepare their 
strength and weapons. But 
that will have no effect, what- 
soever, on the ultimate out- 
come. 

"Japan is a doomed nation."

ture of two more German 
generals, two and one-half 
months after fighting 
ended, was announced yes- 
terday by Third Army

Lt. Gen. Otto Hoffman, 
SS chieftain, surrendered 
in Munich, complaining he 
resented "thoughts that 
the people throughout the 
world regarded the SS as 
a criminal organization." 

The other high-ranking 
Nazi was Col. Gen. Hans 
Von Salmuth, captured at

burg, on a tip from civil- 
ians.

Chinese Besiege 
Air Base City 

CHUNGKING — Chinese 
troops, sweeping toward almost 
isolated Kweilin from the south 
battled into the outskirts of the 
ex-14th Air Force base of 
Yangso and laid siege to the 
Japanese stronghold, a high 
command communique said yes- 
terday. 

Yangso lies 44 miles south of 
Kweilin. Meanwhile, Japanese 
troops launched a sweep south 
of the Yangtze River. to protect 
the vital Japanese trans-conti- 
nental corridor from Korea to 
Hongkong, and bitter fighting 
continued along China's vulner- 
able invasion coast west of For- 
mosa, the communique said. 



New Weapon to Counter 
Suicide Planes Found 

HAMILTON, JNTARIO — A weapon to counteract 
Japanese suicide planes has been developed at a local plant 
here and will be produced in quantity, Rear Admiral B. W. 
Greathead of the British Admiralty revealed Tuesday. 

The nature of the weapon, designed for use by the 
Royal Canadian Navy and other Allied warships, was not 
revealed. Reportedly, it is called the "Disintegrator." A 
number of "Disintegrators" already have been turned over 
to the Canadian Navy. 



Heavy Damage 
Is Inflicted 
In B-29 Raid 

GUAM — Seven industrial 
targets in Osaka and Nagoya's 
industrial area sustained "heavy 
damage" as a result" of Tues- 
day^ record breaking attack by 
625 Superfortresses, the 20th 
Air Force headquarters said 
yesterday. 

Only one Superfortress was 
lost in the attack, although 180 
B-29's landed at Iwo on the re- 
turn trip because of battle dam- 
age or dangerously low fuel. 

The pilots said Jap air op- 
position was almost negligible, 
but anti-aircraft fire was the 
heaviest they had ever seen 
over Osaka. 

"I could see our bombs go 
down, and when I looked again 
the buildings were not there," 
one B-29 crew member said, 
reporting damage to the im- 
portant Kawanishi Aircraft 
plant at Takarazuka, 8 miles 
northwest of Osaka. 



Senator Says Unconditional

WASHINGTON— Sen. Warren G. Magnuson, Wash

^surrender means just that 
Magnuson took the floor dur 
ing a speech by Sen. Burton K 
Wheeler, Democrat of Monta 
na, who said there was "a rising 
flood of demands for a defini 
tion of our terms to the Japan 
ese. The Japanese are whipp 
ed, now. If they had an; 
sense they would surrender 
now." 

"The quickest w r ay to enc 
this war is to say to the Japan 
ese that it is unconditional sur

nuson asserted. If fighting 
on means annihilation of th< 
Japanese empire, then let th< 
Japanese know it. 

"Any information that w<

Cruiser Battered at Leyte Comes 
Back to Join in Okinawa Victory 



WASHINGTON— Although 
Jap suicide planes seriously 
hurt the light cruiser St. 
Louis in the Leyte Gulf bat- 
tle, they could not prevent 
her from coming back to fight 
through the Okinawa cam- 
paign, the U. S. Navy re- 
vealed Wednesday. 

The St. Louis closely sup- 
ported American landings at 
Leyte for 13 days. Then a 
Jap plane dived fro-i the 
clouds and directed a bor:Vb 
at her while she \v. r, ,>w 
on November 27. 



The bomb missed, but 
immediately 10 planes ap- 
proached and one — a single- 
engined dive bomber — peeled 
off for a suicide swoop. 

Guns from the St. Louis 
opened fire, knocking the 
diving plane out of control. 
But it crashed in flames 
against the vessel's starboard 
side, causing fire and explo- 
sions on the cruiser. 

Then five other Kamika- 
zes selected the cruiser for 
attack. In a desperate, 40- 



minute battle, six of the ten 
enemy planes were shot 
down. 

The cruiser was seriously 
damaged and 15 men were 
killed, but she was still afloat 
and full of fight. 

Then came the job of bat- 
tle-damage repair and the 
cruiser's speedy return to 
action. At Okinawa, the St. 
Louis was able to fire 26,265 
rounds of five-inch and six- 
inch projectiles, weighing, in 
all, 2,116,585 pounds into the 
Jap installations. 



7,300 Japs Die 
In Burma Battle 

CALCUTTA— Tank-led Brit- 
ish infantrymen in Burma's 
Pegu hills have killed over 1,300 
Japanese and are locked in a 
battle with an estimated 3,000 
survivors along a 70-mile jungle 
stretch. 

As the conflict entered its 
third day, Allied headquarters 
said yesterday another 80 Jap- 
anese were captured and hun- 
dreds w^ere destroyed in air ar- 
tillery assaults. 

An estimated 5,000 enemy 
troops earlier this week drove 
from several points in attempts 
to cross the Rangoon-Mandalay 
railway and escape toward 
Thailand. They w^ere part of 
an estimated 50,000 who were 
isolated in scattered pockets be- 
tween the Irrawaddy and Sit- 
tang rivers.

Current Bomb Tonnage Rained on Japan 
Tops Average Rate Reached in Europe 

WASHINGTON The recent explosive tonnage dropped on Japan excells the 

average impact rained on Germany by both the Royal Air Force and the U. S. Army 
Air Forces in closing- days of the European campaign, Lt. Gen. Ira C. Eaker, deputy 
rommander and chief of staff of the Army Air Forces, declared at a War Depart- 

ment press conference yesterday. 

The peak load dropped on Germany in a single 
month was 185,000 tons, Eaker said, adding that 270,000 
tons will be dropped on Japan, monthly, by the end of 
1945. 

One Superfortress does the work of five Flying 
Fortresses he said, pointing out that Flying Forts were

Confesor Raps 
Illegal Use of 
Arms, Banditry 

Former Secretary of Interior 
Tomas Confesor Wednesday 
ni"ht declared the most impor- 
tant problem of the country to- 
day is the restoration of law 
and order, asserting that there 
are still thousands of firearms 
in the possession of lawless ele- 
ments. 

Addressing personnel of the 
department of interior at party 
given in his honor, Confesor 
urged "firearms be used for 
legitimate purposes and not for 
lawlessness." 

Confesor, who is leaving soon 
for the United States t<> assume 
his Washington post as member 
of the Philippine Rehabilitation 
Commission, presented a brief 
review of the activities of the 
present administration. 

He pointed out that the ad- 
ministration restored to a cer- 
tain degree cheap transporta- 
tion and carried on the distri- 
bution of relief supplies through 
the Emergency Control Admi- 
nistration which is doing 
P5,000 000 worth of business

He enumerated the six points 
as follows: 

1 — Increase in the pay of the 
soldiers of the Philippine Army. 

2 — Early settlement of pen- 
sions, back pay and other al- 
lowances accruing to Filipino 
soldiers or their beneficiaries. 

3 — Speedy organization and 
activation of the Philippine

4 — Relief for disabled soldiers. 

5 — Relief and employment 
for Filipino veterans who have 
been reverted to civilian life. 

6— Processing of guerrilla

Japan's remaining* airpower 
was also held by Vice Admiral 
Marc C. Mitscher, commander 
of Task Force 58, who soon will 
succeed Fitch as deputy chief 
of naval operations for air. 

Fitch added: 

"Today Japanese aviators 
often high tail for cover when 
the roar of our approaching 
planes is heard. Suicide crashes 
appear less frequently. Why? 

"Because the enemy is pos- 
sibly making every effort to 
save available planes and to 
build up reserves for the next 
air offensive and an impending 
invasion. Also, t\ey may be 
short of gas, of trained pilots, 
and aviation parts. 

"And, finally, the output of 
their aircraft factories, arsenals 
and metal industry plants has 
been seriously crippled by our 
carrier plane attacks teamed 
with Superfortresses. 

Seventy niillion people, 
cramped in the Japanese home-

nation has ever received in 
history."

LONDON — The Conservative national gov- 
ernment of Winston Churchill went down to 
defeat on its domestic policy yesterday under a 
tidal wave of votes which swept into office, 
Clement R. Attlee's Labor 
party espousing a socialist f 
program for nationalist re- 1 
'construction; 

Labor secured 387 seats j 
and Churchill's Conserva- 
tives 194 in the House of 
Commons, out of 640 seats at 
stake. With supporting 
groups, the Labor party held 
over 400 seats. 

Churchill resigned 1 a s t J 
night to King George, who 
immediately commissioned 
Attlee to form a new govern- 

meilt The British Press Association called Labor's 
victory the "most astonishing and significant of 
the century." Churchill and Antony Eden alone 
survived the Conservative-Liberal cabinet of 13. 
Among the defeated were L. S. Amery, secretary 

of India, and Sir William (Continued on page 2>

IN AWFUL CLARITY 

Today, the governments of the United State» Britain and C hma of- 
ficially gave Japanese a last chance to step back from the threshold of 
annihilation." , . ki . . 

In clear, concise language, President Truman and retiring Prime Mas- 
ter Churchill, with concurrence ^ President Chiang Ka.-shek outhned ,usf 
what "unconditional surrender" means. 

The terms are harsh. They do not permit Japar . to enjoy the frujts 
of conquest. The borders of Japan would be pulled back to the ma^n 
islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shlkoku and such . . -nmor ' ' sla ?<^ « 
we determine." Allied troops wouW occupy the home and Stern iust.ce 
would be meted out to those who "deceived and misled the people of 
Japan Into war. Japan's military forces would be disarmed. 

On the other hand, the proclamation offers a way of life perhaps 
more just in defeat, than Japan today enjoys from its own crazed leaders. 
The proclamation specifically states Japan "shall not be enslaved as a 
race or destroyed as a nation." There would be restorat.on of freedom 
of speech, religion, thought, and respect for fundamental human r.gh[ts. 
Eventual Japanese participation in world trade would be permitted. 

The terms are harsh, yes. , But these terms of unconditional surrender 
are nothing compared to the utter annihilation which America, Britain, 
and China are prepared to wreak on the enemy. Japan today stands ai 
the crossroads of history. It is a question of deciding -whether she wants 
a future on our terms, or none at all. 



Churchill Loses... 

Beveridge, author of the much publicized Beveridg-e social 
security plan. 

The first post election statement from Attlee yes- 
day hailed the voting trend as "the first time in the history of 
this country that Labor has ever had a clear cut majority. It 
will enable us to implement the policy of the Socialist party," 
Attlee added. 

Throughout the campaign, Attlee had pledged his party 
to nationalization of mines, heavy industries and transport and 
public ownership of the Bank of England. 



TEXT OF PROCLAMATION TO JAPAN 



WASHINGTON — The following: 
proclamation by heads of the United 
States, United Kingdom, and China 
was signed by the President of the 
United States, Prime Minister of 
United Kingdom at Potsdam and con- 
curred in by the President of National 
Government of China who communi- 
cated with President Truman by dis- 
patch : 

"1 — President of the United States, 
the President of the National Govern- 
ment of the Republic of China, and 
the- Prime Minister of Great Britain, 
representing the hundreds of millions 
of our countrymen, have conferred 
and agree that Japan shall be given 
' an opportunity to end this war. 

- "2— The prodigious land, sea and 
air forces of the United States, Brit- 
ish Empire and of China, many times 
reinforced by their armies and air 
fleets from the west, are poised to 

. strike the final blows upon Japan. 

'.This military power is sustained and 
inspired by the deternvmation of all 
the Allied nations to prosecute the war 
against Japan until she ceases to re- 
sist. 

"3 — The result of the futile and 
senseless German resistance to the 
might of the aroused free people of 



the world stands forth in awful cla- 
rity as an example to the people of 
Japan. The might that now converges 
on Japan is immeasurably greater 
than that which, when applied 
to the resisting Nazis, neces- 
sarily laid waste to the lands, the in- 
dustry and the method of life of the 
whole German people. The full ap- 
plication of our military power, 
backed by oiu resolve, will mean the 
inevitable and complete destruction 
of the Japanese a^med forces and just 
as inevitably the utter devastation of 
the Japanese homeland. 

"4 — The time has come for Japan to 
decide whether she will continue to be 
controlled by those self-willed . mili- 
taristic advisers whose unintelligent 
calculations have brought the Empire 
of Japan to the threshold of annihila- 
tion, or whether she will follow the 
path of reason. 

"5 — Following are our terms. We 
will not deviate from them. There are 
no alternatives. We shall brook no 
delay. 

"6 — There must be eliminated for 
all time the authority and influence 
of those who have deceived and mis- 
led the people of Japan into embark- 
ing on world conquest, for we insist 



that a new order of peace, security 
and justice will be impossible until 
irresponsible militarism is driven 
from the world. 

"7 — Until such a new order is estab- 
lished and until there is convincing 
^roof that Japan's war-making power 
is destroyed, points in Japanese terri-. 
tory to be designated by the Allies 

shall be occupied to secure the achieve- 
ment of the basic objectives we are 

ore setting forth. 

"a—The terms of the Cairo Decla- 

tfion shall be carried out and Jap- 
anese sovereignty shall be limited to 
the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, 
Kyushu, Shikoku, and such minor 
islands as we determine. 

"9 — 'The Japanese military forces, 
after being completely disarmed, 
shall be permitted to return to their, 
homes with the opportunity to lead 
peaceful and productive lives. 

"10— We do not intend that the 
Japanese shall be enslaved as a race 
or destroyed as a nation, but stern 
justice shall be metea* out to all war 
criminals, including those who have 
visited cruelties upon our prisoners. 
The Japanese Government shall re- 
move all obstacles to the revival and 
strengthening of democratic tenden- 



cies among the Japanese people. 
Freedom of speech, of religion, and of 
thought, as well as respect for the 
fundamental human rights shall be 
established. 

"11— Japan shall be permitted to 
maintain such industries as will sus-~ 
tain her economy and permit the exac- 
tion of just reparations in kind, but 
not those which would enable her to 
rearm for war. To this end, access" 
to, as distinguished from control of 
raw materials .shall be permitted. 
Eventual Japanese participation in 
svorld trade relations shall be per-^ 
mitted. 

^. 12 ^ T1 } e occupying forces of the 
Allies shall be withdrawn from Japan 
as soon as these objectives have been"

sponsible government.

Stressing the enormous striking power of the Allies "poised

MORE TO COME 

* 

These must be days when bomb-happy Japanese must re- 
flect with cleep longing on the years that wera when all a good, 
loyal citizen had to do was sip salci, sniff a cherry blossom or two, 
arid knock off for the rest of the day. 

Life now is not too pleasant In the homefand'~not at all 
like the multi-colored brochures the Japanese Chamber of Com- 
nrferce used to spread across the world's magazines pages, in- 
* vfting tourists to view Mt. Fujiyama, the dwarfed gardens, and 
the hoop-like bridges. 

Today, Japanese are busy ducking bombs and shells- For 
the past 16 days, the greatest naval force in the world has been 
fc?ombarding Japan's coastlines I wrecking shipping, and filling 
the skies full of carrier planes. In between, record fleets of 
B-29's have been methodically tearing the gears out of Japan's 
war machine, while Okinawa-based bombers chew up transpor- 
tation and crater airfields. 

As If all that were not enough, there is another significant, 
perhaps final, touch, which should add another furrow of worry 
to. bedeviled Japanese civilians as they crawl in and out of air 
raid shelters. 

The new cloud on the horizon Is the fact that for the first 
time in this war, American troops are not engaged in any major 
land battle in any theater. The crack troops which liberated 
the Philippines in eight months, which knocked over Saipan, 
Guam, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, are more or less idle, or more 
or less available for new offensives, whichever way one looks 
at it. 

Right now, Japan's war leaders are engaged in the un- 
happy game of trying to guess where the American-made 
tKunderbolt of invasion will strike next. 

There are as many possibilities as there is geography in 
the Pacific, for America, with control of the seas, the skies, 
and the best equipped Army In the world, can pick and choose. 

Within the past weeks, the world has seen American naval 
units swirl through the Kuriles in the north Pacific, off the , 
Japanese homeland, and in the South China Sea near Chekiang 
province on the Asiatic mainland. At the same time. Mac- 
Arthur's air fleets have stepped up bombings of Kyushu and 
carried out record-scale smashes at the key Japanese-held 
Chinese bastion of Shanghai. 

Where America's idle armies may strike next, only Amer- 
ica's top war chieftains know. But that they will strike, with 
overwhelming power, the whole world knows, down to the last 
person in Japan,

The disposition of the several ^^ H ™°gtotrifi economies of both the p 

tools will be important to the luture peace timem^ 

ed States and foreign coun-^ 
tries 

Attention is focussed on the 



nit 



machine-tool situation by the 
expansion by Congress of the 
Export-Import Bank to supply 
credits for purchases from the 
United States. Congressional 
action last week raised the 
bank's capital from $700,000,000 
to $3,500,000,000, thereby assur- 
ing the United States' position 
in the economic rehabilitation 
of the world* 

Leo T, Crowley, Foreign Eco- 
nomic Administrator, told a 
Senate'committee that plans for , 
extending credits from the bank 
would include assistance to the 
Soviet Union, Belgium, the Ne- 
therlands, and Denmark, and 
probably to other countries such 
as Poland and Italy when con- 
ditions are appropriate for ne- 
gotiation. 

According to official esti- 
mates, there will be about 
567,000 government- owned ma- 
chine tools eventually available 
for purchase. Scope of the sur- 
plus tool supplies depends di- 
rectly on the rate of war pro- 
duction cutbacks. Impact of the 
eventual release of this great 
number of machine tools "may 
be gauged by the fact that 
American industry owned only 
about 1,000,000 machine tools at 
the end of 1939, and about 70 
percent of these were over 10 
years old." The government's 
present surplus is equal to about 
half of all tools owned by indus- 
try, and almost equals the num- 
ber of obsolete tools,

to the resisting Nuzis, neces- 
sarily laid waste to the lands, 
the industry and the method 
of life of the whole German 
people* The full appKc&tipn 
of our military power, backed by 
our resolve, will mean the in- 
evitable and complete destruc- 
tion of the Japanese armed 
forces and just as inevitably the 
utter devastation of tho Japan- 
ese homeland, 

"4 — The time has come for 
Japan to decide whether she will 
continue to be controlled by 
those self-willed militaristic ad- 
visers whose unintelligent cal- 
culations have brought the Em- 
pire of Japan to the threshold 
of annihilation, or whether she 
will follow the path of reason. 

"5— Following are our terms, 
We will not deviate from them. 
There are no alternatives. We 
shall brook no delay, 

"6— There inn at be eliminated 
for all time the authority and 



influence of those who have de- 
ceived and misled the people of 
Japan into embarking on 
world conquest, for we Insist 
that a new order of peace, se- 
curity and justice will be impos- 
sible until irresponsible militar- 
ism is driven from the world. 

"7 — Until such a new order is 
established and until there is 
convincing proof that Japan's 
war-making power is destroyed, 
points in Japanese territory to 
be designated by the Allies shall 
be occupied to secure the 
achievement of the basic ob- 
jectives we are here setting 
forth, 

"g— The terms of the Cairo 
Declaration shall be carried out 
and Japanese sovereignty shall 
be limited to the islands of Hon- 



shu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shiko- 
ku, and such minor islands as 
we determine. 

"9 — The Japanese military 
forces, after being completely 
disarmed, shall be permitted to 
return to their homes with the 
opportunity to lead peaceful and 
productive lives, 

"10— We do not intend that 
the Japanese shall be enslaved 
as a race or destroyed as a na- 
tion, but stern justice shall be 
meted out to all war criminals, 
including those who have visited 
cruelties upon our, prisoners.

Churchill Defeat Causes 
Sensation at Conference 

POTSDAM — News of the British Labor party's 
election triumph produced a political sensation among 
delegations of three Allied powers meeting here .yester- 
day. 

The defeat of the Churchill government marked the 
second break in the original "Big Three," leaving Stalin 
as the only member of that triu mvirate. 

First impression here among^ - 
correspondents was that Cle- 
ment Attlee would extend 
Churchill the courtesy of in- 
vitation to return to Potsdam 
as a member of the British 
delegation. , 

Speculation also centered 
around how many of Britain s 
commitments as made by Chur- 
chill and Foreign Minister 
Anthony Eden from Teheran 

would be shouldered by the 
shrewd, bald Lab°rite A«I^ 
who previously sat at Potsdam 

as an observer.

Only 3*20© of Once Utu -M Luftwaffe 
Remains After Nazi Disintegration 

^^TTrrTTmm ^vr Tv/r a TXT i T< Un 4Vir» T.nftwmfp^ t Viv itc^if «onth ft« own inter- nrocedures. 



FRANKFURT ON MAIN— 
All that is left in the Ameri- 
can zone of the vaunted 
Luftwaffe that once ruled 
most of Europe's skies — and 
that even planned to bomb 
New York— is a group of 
3,200 signal and mechanical 
specialists who do odd jobs 
for the U.S. forces, a dispatch 
to the N. Y. Times said 
Thursday. 

The Luftwaffe, dissolved in 
a chaos of German collapse, 
so quickly that it will take 
many months of investiga- 
tion to ascertain just what 
happened to it. The biggest 
organized chunk of it, situat- 
ed in the U. S. zone at the 
time of surrender, was 48,000 
men. 

An additional 70,000 were 
reported in the British zone, 
and there are an estimated 
50,000 to 90,000 among the 
Germans in Norway. 



The rest of the Luftwaffe 
— once totaling about 1,000,- 
000 — was dispersed in confu- 
sion. 

A block of 48,000 was kept 



by itself, with its own inter- 
nal administration. They 
have been gradually sifted 
and released, according to 
regular prisoner of war 



Osmefia Will Recommend 
Pension for Mrs. Quezon 

President Osmena plans to recommend to Philippine 
Congress the granting of a pension to Mrs. Manuel L. 
Quezon, Malacanan announced Friday. 

This is in line with the American practice of aiding 
widows of former Presidents, it was said. 

August 1, first anniversary of President Quezon's death, 
has been declared a public holiday. A high mass will be 
said at San Beda Church at 9 a.m. President and Mrs. 
Osmena will attend. 

The Commonwealth Radio hour of the department of 
information will be devoted to the memory of the late 
President. From his office in Malacanan, President Osmena 
will deliver an address over a hookup extending to the 
United States. The broadcast will begin at 12:45 p.m.

Malacanan has announced 
the appointment of Maximo M. 
Kalaw as technical assistant to 
the President. He has been as-

in Washington. 

This was the first indication 
Kalaw had ceased to be secre-

Kalaw left Manila about two 
months ago to attend the Unit-

two being the departments of

Leaflets Spring

WITH 32nd DIVISION 
IN NORTH LUZON — 
Thirty -nine members of a 
Formosan labor battalion, 
the largest single enemy 
group ever taken by the 
32nd Division in the Paci- 
fic, came into American 
lines carrying American 
surrender leaflets yester- 
day. 

The surrender followed 
a day in which Yank 
troops suspended their 
fire, while surrender leaf- 
lets were dropped over re- 
maining Jap pockets in 
northern Luzon and the 
Japs were given a chance 
to surrender. The For- 
mosan group, wearing tat- 
tered clothing, gave up 
near Marasat Grande in 
the Cagayan valley. r 



1 Killed, 2 Hurt In Hijack Attempt 



Julian Baluyot, of 102 J. 
Planas Int. Juan Luna, was 
shot to death Thursday night, 
and two women were more or 
less seriously wounded when 
they attempted to hijack a truck 
loaded with* medical supplies on 
the corner of Juan Luna and 
North Bay Boulevard, it was 
learned from the Manila police 
department yesterday. 

Capt. Vard Vicent of the 
49th Medical Dept. Center, ad- 
mitted the shooting to police 
investigators. He stated that 
early Thursday evening, he 



was following a truck loaded 
with medical supplies as it 
rolled along North Bay Boule- 
vard. Near the corner of 
Juan Luna, a group of Filipi- 
nos clambered up the truck 
as it slowed down and started 
dropping boxes of medical sup- 
plies to the ground. 

The officer tried to stop them. 
When they ignored his order 
Vicent fired his gun and downed 
one of them. 

Sebastiana Torres and Basi- 
lisa Talabucon of 1950 North 
Bay Boulevard were wounded.

LeBrun Flays 
Petain s Record 

PARIS — Former French 
President Albert LeBrun, sob- 
bing as he told in detail of the 
collapse of the French republic, 
joined ex-Premier Edouard 
Daladier yesterday in accusing 
88-year-old Marshal Henri 
Philippe Petain of plotting to 
destroy democracy in France 
and turning the nation into a 
satellite of Nazi Germany. 

LeBrun was the third of 
France's pre-war leaders to 
testify against the aged hero of 
Verdun, later chief of the 
Vichy government. LeBrun 
accused Petain of permitting 
Germans to starve the French 
by taking prodigious quantities 
of food out of France. 

So enfeebled by age and 
weariness that he frequently 
could not hear testimony which 
may cost him his life, Petain 
twiqe refused to speak in his 
own defense.

delegate on the UNRRA Coui 
cil, Hendrickson said. "Thei

made to Russia at this time be

Following his resignation, 
Churchill issued the following

Only Two Soions 
Oppose History 
Making Policy 

WASHINGTON — In a 
history making decision the 
U. S. Senate yesterday ra- 
tified the United Nations 
world charter with an al- 
most unanimous vote of 8S 
to 2. 

The Senate thereby pledged the 
U. S. to join with 49 other 
Allied nations in an interna- 
tmna] peace-keeping organize 
tmn and climaxed the reversal of 
an American policy typified hy 
the rejection of the Lea^ur of 
Nations 25 years a#o. 

The ratification, followed six 
days of discussion in the Senate 
dunnj- which approximately fid 
senators outlined their views 
They raised only a handful, of 
criticisms of charter provision, 
although its proponents cau- 
tioned that it was not a perfect 
document. 

With ratification of the char- 
ter by Great Britain, Russia, 
China, France, and a majority 
of other countries, the machin- 
ery will be set in motion for the 
establishment of a league anions 
Allied nations geared to an at- 
tempt at. settlement of interna- 
tional disputes by peaceful 
means, or force, if necessary. 

The only two negative votes 
submitted were ma de by Sena- 
tors William K. Lan^r, Rcpub- 
Ucaii, of North Dakota, and 
Hen nk Ships lead, Hepublican, 
of Minnesota.

committee of the U. S\ House \tf 
Representatives were in Manila

FULFILLMENT 

• 

* The following editorial, expressing gratitude of the 
splendid assistance rendered by Filipinos in^ the ivar 
against Japan, and emphasizing obligations ivhich fall on 
the United States, is reprinted from the Louisville, Ken- 
tucky, Courier -Journal: 

★ * ★ 

"The news that the first U.N.R.R.A. shipment of supplies — 
food, clothing and medicine — is on its way to the Philippines 
and that our Army engineers are making miraculous headway 
in the long time job of restoring bomb devastated Manila in- 
dicates a beginning toward fulfillment of our obligations and 
responsibilities to the Filipino people. 

"Our brave allies in the Pacific have prior claim on what- 
ever help we can render. Their ceaseless guerrilla warfare against 
the Japanese has made possible liberation of the islands in 
little more than eight months with a minimum of American 
lives. And their loyalty to the United States, their trust in 
our good intentions, have given us an opportunity to advance 
our prestige in the Orient by furthering not only the independ- 
ence of the Philippines, but their national destiny as well. 

"Generd MacArthur, in his recent speech before the Com- 
monwealth legislature, promised that the Army would progres- 
sively give more and more aid to Filipinos as the war situation 
' permits. He also expressed confidence that the United States 
would not fail to help islands achieve economic stability once 
independence has been granted. Fulfillment . of the first of 



in 

thlse promises is on way.

an than any surface craft 
have yet ventured, nine 
American destroyers en- 
tered Tokyo Bay last 
Sunday night in bright 
moonlight, fired 16 torpe- 
does and blazing guns at 
a big Jap merchant con- 
voy, and destroyed at least 
two of the vessels. 

After the attack, the 
destroyers left the bay suf- 
fering no casualties or 
damage. 

Naval officers, declaring 
at least two of the. convoy 
vessels had been sunk,

retreated up the bay. Jap 
ships returned the fire 
without scoring any hits.

Kaiser to Enter 
Cheap Car Field 

SAN FRANCISCO — Henry 
J. Kaiser, the shipbuilder who 
is already planning to build 
ships, planes and houses after 
the war, will also go into the 
automobile business with the 
manufacture of a large light- 
weight low-priced car to be 
called the "Kaiser," he said 
yesterday. 

The new car would be built 
on the West Coast by a new 
company to be known as the 
Kaiser-Frazer corporation. An- 
other new car called the 
"Frazer," large middle-priced 
auto, will be produced at the

Mich. 



American Reaction Mixed to Labor's 
Surprise Victory in Briti sh Ballot 

SAN FRANCISCO — American reaction to thej>~ 
British election with its success of the British Labor 
Party ranged from jubilancy in labor and liberal circles 
to calm acceptance and outward manifestations of dis- 
appointment" among conservative elements. 

William Green, president of the American Federa- 
tion of Labor said "Labor's victory in Great Britain 
must be interpreted as an outcome of the insistent de- 
sire of British workers to gain higher living standards 
and a greater degree of economic and social security." 

i ® Joseph, Curran, president of 

the National Maritime Union of 



Yugoslavs Will 
Hold Election 

BELGRADE— Yugoslav Vice 
President Edvard Kardelj said 
yesterday elections would be 
held this fall, declaring "Yugo- 
slavia, which never had a demo- 
cracy, will be able to build up its 
democratic order" on the basis 
of election laws to be proposed 
next month. 

The projected laws, he ex- 
plained, would impose "certain 
restrictions on the democratic 
ticket for all those who collabo- 
rated with the,, enemy and have 
not since rehabilitated them- 
selves. 

"Those who consciously or vo- 
luntarily fought on the side of 
the enemy cannot be creators 
of the new Yugoslavia." 



China Consul Silent 
On Trading Curbs 

Chinese Vice Consul Chih- 
Hwa Chen told newsmen yester- 
day his country is interested in

ship with the Philippines, stat- 
ing that local problems should 
not be permitted to affect such 
relationship. 

This statement was made in 
reply to questioning on reaction 
of the Chinese community to re- 
cent legislative attempt to na- 
tionalize retail trade and to 
award lease of stalls in public 
markets only to Filipinos. 



Largest Helicopter 
Tested by Navy 

WASHINGTON— The world's 
largest helicopter and the first 
to be specifically designed for 
air transport operations, has 
completed its flight tests, it was 
announced here yesterday. The 
ship carrying two motors, one 
at each end, is the first success- 
ful design using that plan. 

Built by a Philadelphia en- 
gineering firm under contract 
with the U. S. Navy's Bureau 
of Aeronautics, the craft has a 
streamlined fuselage 48 feet 
long and 13 feet high. 



Truman Praises 
Penicillin Leader 

WASHINGTON — In a mes- 
sage sent from Potsdam last 
night, President Truman praised 
Sir Alexander Fleming, discov- 
erer of penicillin, as the man 
to whom "world owes a debt of 
gratitude difficult to estimate.'' 

Truman expressed regret 
that he was unable to attend 
the dinner at which Fleming 
received the 1944 "Humanita- 
rian Reward" of the Variety 
Clubs of America, the national 
charitable organization of show 
business. 



the Congress of Industrial Or- 
ganizations, said he regarded 
the labor victory as a "welcome 
sign of the growing strength of 
labor and the progressive forces 
in building a post-war Europe 
of free people." 

Sen. Walter F. George of 
Georgia, ranking' Democratic 
member of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, expressing 
frank surprise, asserted the 
change "will inject a certain 
amount of uncertainty" in inter- 
national relations. However, he 
thought the election results 
should have no influence on the 
prosecution of the war against 
Japan. 

Sen. George D. Aiken, Repub- 
lican, of Vermont predicted 
"vast repercussions" in India 
and elsewhere. While asserting 
that England had by no means 
gone Communist, Aiken pre- 
dicted the "Labor Party would 
not be so anxious as the old gov- 
ernment to restore an Italian 
king to the throne." 

Rep. Charles A. Eaton, New 
Jersey, a delegate to the United 
Nations confei'ence, did not ex- 
pect any "wild radical change" 
as a result of Churchill's defeat. 

Rep. John E. Rankin, Demo- 
crat, Mississippi, foresaw in 
Churchill's defeat an indication 
of a "Communist trend," adding 
"I'm disappointed with the elec- 
tion results' in England. Church- 
ill was a great man and a 
great servant of his people. His 
defeat is distressing." 

Senator Warren R. Austin, 
Republican, Vermont, said "I 
have no doubt that .Attlee will 
carry out the general policies 
and principles of Churchill even 
to making "some improvements 
in the details." 



Fatso Suffers 
Heart Attack 

MONDORF LES BAINS, 
LUXEMBOURG— Former 
Reichsmarshal Hermann 
Goering suffered a heart 
attacked during an elec- 
trical storm here Saturday. 

Fear of thunder and 
lightning caused Goering's 
attack, according to an 
army surgeon at the inter- 
rogation camp where the 
Nazi war criminal was 
interned. 

Diminishing the use of 
paracodine, to cure Goering 
of his long standing drug 
habit, did not contribute 
to the heart attack, the 
surgeon said. 



Adurru Favors 
Old Labor Court 

Secretary of Labor Marcelo 
Adurru will recommend to 
President Osmena the revival of 
the court cf industrial relations 
to facilitate the handling of 
cases involving conflicts between 
labor and capital, it was learned 
yesterday. 

Labor leaders representing 
the Committee on Labor Organi- 
zation petitioned President Os- 
mena for the creation of na- 
tional labor relations board sim- 
ilar to that in the United States 
to replace the court of industrial 
relations. 

Adurru expressed the opinion 
that the achievement of a labor 
court does not depend on its 
name but on the men in it. He 
said that if the court of indus- 
trial relations were revived and 
placed in capable hands it would 
prove satisfactory to both labor 
and capital. 



NAZI SHELLS FOR JAPS 

PARIS — Col. T. J. Kane of 
Ordnance Section of the U. S. 
Forces in the European theater 
said here yesterday part of 
nearly 1,000,000 tons of cap- 
tured German ammunition will 
be used against Japan. 



Attlee Adviser Reveals 
Plan to Erase Franco 

LONDON — Professor Harold Laski, Socialist, in- 
tellectual and writer — called the power behind the scenes 
of the new British Labor government — yesterday an- 
nounced that a major aim of the Attlee cabinet was to 
wipe out political "plague spots" .in Europe especially 
that of the Nationalist government in Spain. 



Implying that British labor 
intends to move actively in op- 
position to Fascist regimes, 
Laski said, "We intend to use 
our influence to erase those 
nlague spots represented by the 
Franco regime. 

"The period of non-interven- 
tion is over. At l&st we are 
<roing to be in a position to do 
full justice to our Spanish com* 
rades," meaning those Republi- 
cans who are working in exile 
for Franco's overthrow. 

Laski did not mention other 
"plague spots" but it was in- 
dicated that the labor landslide 
was bad news for the right wing 



•governments of Portugal as well 
as Greece. 

The chances of the kings of 
Greece, Yugoslavia, and Bel- 
gium regaining their thrones 
likewise was lessened by Brit- 
ain's swing to the left in the 
recent election, it was pointed 
out.

Jap Aide Says Nation Unaffectei 
By Allied Demand for Surrende 



'No Q4mis Choke, J km To 




-{mm 



c 



SAN FRANCISCO — Radio Tokyo yesterday, 
broadcasting its first reaction by an eminent public 
Japanese personage to Thursday's Allied surrender 
proclamation, declared "the entire Japanese nation 
will remain absolutely unaffected in- resolute deter- 
mination to save their country from extermination. " 

While Japan awaited an address by Premier 
Suzuki, Gen. Jiro Minami, president of the Greater 
Japan Political Association, said in a press interview 
that Japan never would offer its unconditional 
surrender. 

Tokyo Radio quoted Minami 
as saying, "The Japanese nation 
will be ready to talk peace only 
when the whole of East Asia is 
freed from Anglo-American 
exploitation. Peace conditions 
put out by the enemy war lead- 
ers in their Potsdam proclama- 
tion are exactly contrary to 
what the Japanese people think 
are righteous. 

"Hence, the natural conclusion 
would be that the Japanese 
nation has no other choice than 
to push ahead with its war ef- 
fort in fullest observance of the 
Imperial Rescript declaring war 
on the United States and Great 
Britain. 

"The enemy certainly will 
follow up this Potsdam pro- 
clamation with further inten- 
sified attacks, not only with 
explosive bombs but also with 
'paper' and 'voice* bombs, but 
one thing: is certain — that the 
entire Japanese nation will 
remain absolutely unaffected 
in their resolute determina- 
tion to save their country 
from national extermination," 
Minami was quoted as say- 
ing. 

Domei news agency, in wire- 
less transmissions to the people 
of East Asia, for the most part 
listed terms of the surrender 
proclamation factually. 

Tokyo morning newspapers 
also carried rather prominently 
the story of Potsdam, under 



Okinawans 'Grateful' for U.S. 
Charity, Spokesman Declares 



British elections. 

Domei reported headlines on 
surrender proclamation stories 
as follows: 

Asahi Shimbun — "United 
States, Britain and Chungking 
announce final conditions for 
Japanese surrender. Believed 
to be move largely aimed at 
propaganda effect." 

Hochi Shimbun — "Proclama- 
tion betrays enemy's daydream 
and illusion,. Japanese people 
paying no heed to enemy's 
move." 

Youmiri Hochi Shimbun — 
"Potsdam proclamation crafty 
move taken with eyes both on 
Japanese people and enemy's 
own internal situation." 

Nippon Sangyo Kaizai — 
"Surrender terms will be en- 
tirely ignored. Enemy's pro- 
paganda maneuvers will be 
blasted."

WITH U. S. FAR EAST 
AIR FORCES, LUZON — 
America's newest warplane — 
the B-32 super bomber — made 
its first mission May 29 and 
wiped out a small Japanese- 
held village in Luzon's Caga- 
yan valley, it was revealed 
yesterday for the first time. 

Only two of the sky giants 
designed to join long-range 
smashes against Japan itself 
made the attack. But they 
dropped thousands of pounds 
of bombs on Antatet, Jap- 
anese supply center 12 miles 
southwest of Ilagan, 



f £ %J KJL 

The B-32's, only slightly 
smaller than the Nippon- 
smashing B-29's, started their 
operations under Gen. George 
C. Kenney's Far East Air 
Force. Bombs were dropped 
shortly before noon. 

Hundreds of soldiers 
watched the sturdy, glisten- 
ing planes depart from a busy 
Luzon airfield. They were 
unescorted on the hour and a 
half mission. Spectators all 
were conscious that the event 
heralded future mass opera- 
tions of B-32's from the Phil- 
ippines. 



Col. Merrill D. Burnside, 
overall commander of the 
operation, said the new bomb- 
ers demonstrated they are a 
"topnotch" weapon. They 
performed perfectly and justi- 
fied all predictions. Satur- 
day's strike was the first time 
a B-32 had ever dropped 
bombs anywhere in the world, 
he said.* 

The mission involved pre- 
cision bombing from 10,000 
feet with 1,000-pound bombs. 
The target was a tiny cluster 
of buildings showing faintly 



in Cagayan's broad expanse. 

Photographs showed bombs 
were laid in precise rows 
completely across the town. 
Direct hits were scored on a 
large warehouse and other 
buildings, one of which was 
presumed to be Japanese 
headquarters. The target 
was selected primarily to pro- 
vide an operational test with- 
out opposition from anti-air- 
craft guns or enemy planes. 

The new super-plane, squat, 
barrel chested, and formid- 
able, dwarfed all other planes 
on the Luzon field.

VICTORY FOR MANKIND 

In the decisive months which followed victory in the last 
war, all those peoples who turned their backs on world respon- 
sibilities, and Americans were one of them, helped lay the 
groundwork for today's butchery. 

Today, the United States, through the action of its Senate 
Saturday, has laid the groundwork for tomorrow's enduring 
peace, as the first major country to approve the United 
Nations world charter. 

In the intervening 27 years, the world has learned the folly 
of isolation, of erecting barriers between nations, of ignoring 
wrongs committed against neighbors. Americans, as well as 
British, Russians, Chinese, Czechs, French, and all the others, 
have learned that it avails nothing to withdraw into a shell of 
indifference, pull the covers over one's head, and pretend "it 
could never happen here." 

Peoples who love peace have found that it takes more than 
love to maintain peace. They have learned that when organ- 
ized Fascism stalks the world, only organized democracy can 
erase it. 

To all those who have faith in a better world, the action 
of the United States Senate, boldly inscribing on history's pages 
that America has unequivocally abandoned traditional isola- 
tionism and taken her place among the brotherhood of nations, 
comes as a victory for mankind. 

And it is just that the only major nation which failed to ap- 
prove the League of Nations in 1918, should become the first 
to approve the United Nations in 1945. 

Church to h in Police 
Drive to Curb Delinquency 

Full cooperation will be extended by the Church 
in the program initiated by Col. J. P. Holland, provost 
marshal and chief of police of Manila, to curb the rising 
rate of juvenile delinquency, it was announced by the 
Office of the Archbishop of Manila today. 

According to a spokesman of

Hull Leads Plaudits for U. S. 
Action in Signing U. N. Chart© 

WASHINGTON — Former Secretary of State Cordell Hull commenting c 
Senate's ratification of the United Nations charter Sunday, declared that " 
overwhelming approval the Senate has given the world a striking demonstrat 
the determination of our people that this country shall meet fully its share 
sponsibility in the maintenance of future peace and security and in the adi 
ment of the well-being off- 
mankind." 
Hull's statement, released by 

the War Department, commend-

plane of its debate" on the char- 
ter and for the "fine spirit of 

non-partisanship" manifested 

throughout. 
Acting Secretary of State 

Joseph C. Grew asserted that 

"the passage of the charter by 

the Senate is a memorable event 

in the history of the U. S. and

Senators and representatives

the charter ratification, indicat-

world peace. 

Sen. Harley M. Kilgore: "In 

ratifying the charter the Senate 

has pledged this country to a 

vigorous part in international 

collaboration toward a more

Sen. Allen J. Ellender: "The 
Senate of the U. S. has opened 
the way for effective coopera-

constructive and peaceful effort 
throughout the world." 

Sen. James M. Tunnell: "To- 
day, we are all nearer the great 
c:oal of cooneration among na-

peace than we have ever been 
in the history of the universe."

tion is accepting its interna- 
tional responsibility in a new 
era." 

Sen. Harold H. Burton: "The 
genius of the charter is in its

Rep. Sol Bloom: "We have 
today made a long step forward

First Vegetables Grown in Huge 
Luzon Farm Go to Army Hospital 



The first of the vegetables 
to be served troops from the 
new Quartermaster farm, 80 
miles northwest of Manila, 
were eaten by patients of the 
60th General Hospital at the 
noon meal Saturday when 
fresh radishes were served. 

Many tons of fresh veget- 
ables — including such delica- 
cies as watermelon and can- 
taloupe—will be rushed daily 



to troops throughout the war 
theater by November. They 
will be carried in planes, 
iced freight cars, and speedy 
"reefer" vans. 

The farm, located near 
Tarlac, is in the heart of Lu- 
zon's richest agricultural dis- 
trict. It will be operating on 
a 24-hour day by fall, with 
weekly harvesting and plant- 
ing. 



Army officers and enlisted 
men, including a number of 
agricultural experts, super- 
vise Filipino workers in har- 
vesting, planting, processing, 
packaging, and in disease 
control operations at the 
huge tract. 

Modern U. S. tractors, 
planters, cultivators, spray- 
ers, and dusters are included 
in the equipment.

WASHINGTON — Brig. Gen. William F. F. Heavey, whose engineer brigade 
has made 82 combat landings in the Paci f ic, declared Sunday that he does not anti- 
cipate great difficulty in establishing bea chheads on the Japanese coast. 

Heavey, who commands the Second Engineer Spe- 
cial Bridage, told a press conference Jap suicide planes 
"will not seriously interfere with Allied landings on the 
Japanese home islands." 

He added that Gen. MacArthur's weather predic- 
tion service is so efficient that the typhoon season need 
not prove an insurmountable obstacle to projected land- 
ings anywhere. 



U.S. Occupation 
Not 'Temporary' 

BERLIN — American soldiers 
in Europe occupation duties 
will be returned to the United 
States as "conditions warrant" 
but transfers will not be so 
quick as to jeopardize peace, 
President Truman said yester- 
day. 

In an interview with the 
Army newspaper Stars and 
Stripes, Truman said occupa- 
tion of Europe was not tempo- 
rary, and problems of soldiers 
and separated families can be 
solved by getting soldiers back 
home soon as possible. 

Returning servicemen who 
want work should have <; no 
serious troubles," Truman said, 
explaining employers wanted to 
cooperate in rehiring veterans.

Van Lear Woodward, director of the Philippine mission of the Foreign Eco-

LIMA — Dr. Jose Luis Busta-

president of Peru yesterday. 
He ran with Liberal and Leftist 
backing in the June elections 
and was proclaimed president 
July 21 by the national elector- 
al board. 



"The Leyte beachhead was 
secured between typhoons which 
struck that Philippine island 14 
days apart. Yet in that opera- 
tion a complete tactical surprise 
was effected. The Japanese 
were caught off balance, believ- 
ing, as they did, that we Ameri- 
cans were not so crazy as to 
land in the middle of the ty-

plained. 

The Second Engineer Special 
Brigade is a self-contained am-

nical troops equipped with 400 
landing craft. The brigade is 
composed of ship and shore spe-

good beach positions and holds 
them after removing all shore 
and offshore obstacles.
