It is with profound joy that I extend fondest personal greetings to the 
people of Baler as they commemorate the 100th birth anniversary of the late 
President Manuel L. Quezon. 

We honor Quezon for his dynamic leadership and radical nationalism by 
which he endowed our people with an unshakable faith in themselves. As a 
statesman, he led our peaceful struggle for national independence and 
self-determination. As a citizen, he was a model of genuine patriotism and a 
source of inspiration for our countrymen. Indeed, it is impossible to depict 
the entire scheme of our political life and destiny without giving mention to 
the efforts and achievements of Quezon 

It is in this spirit that I enjoin the people of Baler to celebrate this 
occasion. Inspired by the memory of their most illustrious townsmate, I 
trust that they will consider this event as an opportunity to reinforce their 
solidarity and to inject fresh vigor to their programs for the growth and 
progress of their community. 

My wishes for a solemn and fruitful Ue!c Wtfli

The involvement and the enthusiastic response of practically all sectoral groups of the community, 
from the start of the preparation and up to the culmination of the MLQ Centennial celebration on 
August 19 this year, is by itself an expression of the love and devotion to the memory of the foremost 
son of Baler - the late President Manuel Luis Quezon. I find no words to express and convey my 
profund gratitude to all of them. 

Indeed, there is a solemn duty for all of us to get involved in this Centennial celebration of Manuel 
L. Quezon; the 100th year anniversary of his birth. The government programs of the New Society 
under the dynamic leadership of President Ferdinand R Marcos have a close parallelism if not with 
identical similarities with the basic social and political philosophy of the late President Quezon. Under 
both leadership our country attained self-determination and gained national identity and highest respect 
as a people and nation. The MLQ Centennial this year manifests Filipino unity and the emulation of the 
£* of thelate President Manuel L. Quezon towards the establishment o/a strong anTt^y F^l 



ESTRELLO T. ONG 
Municipal Mayor 






Reminiscence, indeed, can be a most delightful adventure. And for us who are now fondly looking 
back during this centennial celebration of the birth of that champion of social justice and father of 
Philippine independence, our own Manuel L. Quezon, it is a great emotional experience. The historical 
picture is vivid enough. We can see how he finally led our people in breaking away from the bondage of 
empire, from the indignity of foreign domination. Because of him and other leaders like him, we are 
today enjoying that wonderful sense of oneness as a people. 

On this centennial celebration, our hearts are swelling with pride. We are honoring a great man, one 
from our very own. We feel we can flaunt about with vicarious feelings of success and glory. So let it 
be but certainly, we are also honoring this Star of Baler because we owe him a debt of gratitude! 
Through the political independence movement which he spearheaded, he finally gave the Filipino people 
a common identity! And, in addition, he gave notice to the world that we were going to solve our 
problems in our own way. 

As we look back let us give President Manuel L. Quezon the honor he deserves by giving meaning 
to the noble causes he staunchly stood for - not just by way of grandiose lip service here and now during 
anniversaries but by actually contributing ourselves heretofore towards the alleviation of the social 
problems of our countrymen. Let not any one of us be entitled to moralize about poverty, for instance 
unless he contributes towards the actual easement of that poverty - not by alms or by charity alone but 
by a deep involvement in the solution of the social problem itself. Indeed, what is required for all of us is 
to prove our good intentions, to come out with deeds and not merely with empty extravagant 
professions! 





PEDRO Q. MOLINA 
Major General (Retired) 








To the Filipino nation, Manuel L. Quezon shall forever be remembered as a true statesman A man 
of selfless dedication to duty. A man who had the courage to uphold the primary interest of the country 
above and beyond diversified and conflicting partisan interests, to the extent of sacrificing his own life. 
His famous words, "my loyalty to my party ends where my loyalty to my country begins, " is a hallmark 
of the man 's firm devotion to his country. 

To us, citizens of Baler, Manuel L. Quezon is a model to emulate. He has shown the country that 
the people of Baler can produce a national leader who can rise up to the demands of the times. He 
exemplifies what a worthy citizen of Baler should be, and could accomplish. He handed down to us, sons 
and daughters of Baler, the responsibility of being born to leadership . . . of being able to overcome the 
seemingly insurmountable demands of progress and prosperity for our town and our people. 

The past one hundred years of Manuel L. Qiezon provokes in us a number of questions. 

Are we ready and willing to assume the burden of leadership . . . of working for the good not only 
of ourselves but also to our town and our people? Have there been significant contributions from all of 
us in creating a healthy community for Baler? Have we responded to the call to national greatness that 
our Government has been trying to instill in our hearts and minds? 

Perhaps, it is fitting that we now re-examine our role in this communis, .» M v u* s+i 
and stands that Manuel L. Quezon had drawn. Let us voZfofa ~1 ofZ^LfuTu'nftZ

To the people of the Subprovince of Aurora, the 1978 MANUEL LUIS QUEZON Centennial 
Celebration is doubly significant Our people should take pride that Quezon was born in this almost 
forgotten shores of Aurora. For as long as the legend of this great statesman lives on, it will always be 
remembered that Aurora Subprovince has made its share in nation-building. 

Baler, the birth place of our distinguished t( Kababay an, "cannot take solely the pride and honor for 
this great event - his Centennial Birth Anniversary, and must share it with the other municipalities of 
Aurora Subprovince. The municipality of Maria Aurora during the lifetime of President Quezon was a 
part of Baler, and then called barrio San Jose. Whenever President Quezon visited Baler, the Ilongots 
from barrio San Jose came to Baler to welcome him. The Ilongots rendered tribal dances and cultural 
presentations to the amazement and excitement of the late President Quezon and Party. This simple 
reminiscence shows that the municipality of Maria Aurora had already a special place and admiration in 
the heart of Quezon and his family. It is with this context that sometime in 1949, this barrio, endowed 
with its rich agricultural potentials, was made into a regular municipality and named after the Quezon 
eldest daughter - Maria Aurora. 

On this occasion, and in behlaf of my family and townmates permit me to extend my 
congratulations for a happy celebration.

/ am extending my sincerest congratulations to our guests, concerned citizens, officers and 
members of the Quezon Centennial Celebration who, in one way or another, have made this affair 
possible. 

The occasion of the town fiesta of Baler, in honor of your Patron Saint, San Luis which coincides 
with the birthday of our beloved President Manuel Luis Quezon is a momentous event in our history.

always. May this occasion also serve as a foundation of unity among the masses in attaining the goals of 
the New Society in order that progress and development be enhanced. 

It is therefore hoped that this celebration be colorful and meaningful to surpass other occasions 
that occurred during the past May peace be with us and our conscience be cleared that the spirit of 
happiness be on our family and friends.

Today, whenever we celebrate an occasion, we view the event in a very significant historical 
perspective. Our commemoration of the 100th birth anniversary of the great leader, politician, father 
and statesman - PRESIDENT MANUEL LUIS QUEZON - is our way of paying tribute not only to the 
man but also to our present collective effort at pursuing the ideals and values that man stood for, 
signifying our goals and aspirations as a people more so in the context of our present struggle for the 
formation of a new socio-economic political order. 

It is with great pride that we look back to that fateful August 19, 1878 when the man destined to 
be one of the greatest actors in the annals of our political history was born. He would later stand out to 
be declared the-FATHER OF THE PHILIPPINE REPUBLIC. 

When the great forces and strains of our historical experience at that time criss-crossed at the 
juncture where our solitary statesman stood - he acted and fought for what he believed to be what was 
right, proper and good for our people. He believed in our right at self government and fought for it for 
almost one-third of his lifetime. He was at the helm working for an independent Philippines and the goal 
was already within sight. The passing of the Tydings-McDuffy Law resulted in the 1935 Constitution - 
the basis of our system of government for the next couple of generations. It is indeed a tragedy that he 
died without witnessing the independence of our country. His efforts have not been in vain, for we, the 
Filipino peoples, still preserve the ideals that he stood and fought for. 

In behalf of the citizens of the Municipality of Dilasag, Subprovince of Aurora, Quezon, I would 
want to humbly expound my ardent esteem to the centennial celebration of our late great President and 
we as a nation salute the man who declared: "I WOULD RATHER PREFER TO SEE THE 
PHILIPPINES RUN LIKE HELL BY A FILIPINO THAN TO SEE THIS COUNTRY RUN LIKE 
HEA VENBYA FOREIGNER. "

BRIEF SOCIO ECONOMIC PROFILE 
of Baler, Aurora Subprovince 



by: MDC CONRADO P. AMAZONA 



General Description: 

Geographically, Baler lies in the northeastern part of 
Quezon Province. It is the center and capital town of 
Aurora Subprovince. The place is characteristically cool 
and invigorating. Generally, the topography of Baler is 
hilly but the populated area lies sprawled on the south- 
eastern part of the Baler Valley. It is surrounded with 
swamps and rivers which are potential for irrigation 
purposes. Baler is also rich in legends and histories. 

Agriculture: 

Baler is basically an agricultural community. Its base 
industries are rice and coconut production. Out of its 
8,565 hectares total land area, 60% has been devoted to 
agriculture. Baler is self-sufficient in rice production. Of its 
agricultural total land area, 2,626 hectares are devoted to 
coconut productions. 

Infrastructure: 

Generally, all the barangays are now accessible to 
transportation either by jeepneys or tricycles. However, 
more of these barangay roads have to be improved and 
bridges to be constructed. Majority of the main tho- 
roughfares in the poblacion have been paved. Below are 
listing of completed and proposed infrastructure projects: 

Completed: 

a) Kinalapan Bailey Bridge 

b) Public Market Annex Building 

Proposed: 

a) Agwang Bridge (connecting Baler to Reserva) 

b) Sabang Seawall (shoreline protection) 

c) Baler Port 

d) Watertank for water facilities sedimentation 

e) Municipal electrification 
Education: 

In the elementary level of education, Baler has no 
major problems since all the barangays have school 
buildings, majority with complete elementary education. 
However, secondary education should be provided in the 



locality. There are only two private high schools, one 
provincial and one barangay high school in Baler, with one 
college offering limited courses at present. 

Tourism: 

Potential for tourist development are as follow: 

a) The birth spot of the late President Manuel L. 
Quezon now converted to Quezon Park. 

b) Cemento,with its natural rock formation^ 
favorite picnickers place. 

c) Cave of Santa Isabel at sitio Castillo. 

d) The historic church of Baler. 

e) The white beach of Baler Bay. 

f) The Chapel at Ermita ridge overlooking the 
Pacific Ocean. 

g) Dicaloyungan watershed. 

Health and Sanitation: 

Health and sanitation in Baler has improved tremen- 
dously although there are more rooms for improvement. 
Garbage collections and drainage system remained as the 
two perennial problems in Poblacion, which the local 
administration is seriously and determined to resolve. 
Employment: 

The lack of manufacturing and commercial establish- 
ment in the locality creates a situation where job oppor- 
tunities are difficult to find. However, the municipality of 
Baler, with its package financial plans for the next 5-year 
period, forces a bright financial increase beginning CY 
1978. The proposed Tax Mapping of Real Estate admi- 
nistration Project which will be implemented next calendar 
year will surely increase the present municipal income by 
triple. 

True, constraints in these opportunities may not be 
avoided. To mention some, Baler is a typhoon path and 
has an average of two to three typhoons which pass the 
locality yearly. Another is the transportation problem 
which isolates the town from the adjacent provinces which 
are potential markets for its farm produce.

Obispo ay sinasabayan sa taong ito - ng ika-100 taong ng pagsilang ng yumaong anak na dakila ng 
Baler - si Manuel Luis Quezon. 

Ang kadakilaan ni Manuel L. Quezon ay laging nananatili sa ala-ala natin dahil sa siya'y unang 
pangulo ng ating Gobyernong Pilipinas at lalo't higit siya'y kinikilala na masigasig na taga-taguyod ng 
katarungang panlipunan sa ating bansa. 

Sa kasalukuyan ang katarungan ay hindi na lamang isa sa mga patakaran ng lipunan. Ito'y 
pangunahing patakaran. Walang lipunan ang maaaring ipagmalaki ninuman kung hindi umuugat sa 
katarungan. Lalo na ngayon, sa pagkamulat ng mga tao f ating napapansin ang laganap at palagiang 
aspirasyon nila tungkol sa pagkakapantay-pantay at partisipasyon na kapuwa ay nagpapahiwatig ng 
pagkalikha ngDiyos sa tao: malaya at marangal Kay a sa gitna ng kakulangan ng katarungan isinisigaw 
ng tao ang tinataglay na kanyang pagkatao. 

Ang Mabuting Balita na ipinahayag ni San Luis Obispo ay natutuon sa pagibig ng Diyos sa tao. 
u Ganyan na lamang ang pagibig ngDiyos sa tao na isinugo niya ang kanyang bugtong na anak" upang 
ilaan ang buong sarili dahil sa atin. Samakatuwid, ang tao'y pinakamahalaga sa Diyos sapagkat ang 
tao'y kanyang pinakamamahal Dahil dito, pinaninindigan ng Inang Simbahan na ang pagkilos 
alang-alang sa katarungan at ang pagpapartisipa sa pagbabago ng lipunan ay kabahagi ng pagpapahayag 
ng Mabuting Balita ng paghahari ng Panginoon. 

Nawa'y ang ating pagdiriwang ng ating Kapistahan sa Baler ay sabayan ng ating pagdiriwang ng 
ika-100 pagsilang ni Manuel Luis Quezon ayon sa nararapat Alalaon baga, isang pagdiriwang na siyang 
magbibigay sa ating lahat ng panibagong pang-unawa, sigla at determinasyon na itaguyod ang 
katarungang panlipunan, na paglabanan ang lahat na pinanggagalingan ng pang-aapi at pagsasamantala 
sa tao, lalo na sa mga walang lakas at walang tinig dala ng kanilang kahirapan at katayuan sa lipunan.

SPECIAL UNNUMBERED RESOLUTION 



WHEREAS, Aurora Subprovince has an area of 302,000 hectares, more or less, a population of 91,247 
based on 1975 census, and an average annual income of P918,001.80, by virtue of which income, it had 
been reclassified from Fifth Class to Third Class province, under Department of Finance Order No. 42-73, 
dated 3 December 1973; 

WHEREAS, the foregoing figures and statistics are mute testimonies that Aurora Subprovince can 
viably exist as a regular and independent province; 

WHEREAS, practically all provincial and national offices needed by a regular-province are already 
established and existing within Aurora Subprovince, and even the Supreme Court saw fit that there be the 
Aurora Chapter in the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, separate and distinct from that of Quezon' 

WHEREAS, the existence of the offices mentioned in the immediately preceding paragraph 
notwithstanding, there are still official businesses and transactions that can only be done in Lucena City 
thereby, compelling government officials and ordinary citizens of Aurora Subprovince alike, to travel, a 
distance of more than 400 kilometers, a travel which is both money and time consuming- 

WHEREAS, the segregation of Aurora Subprovince from Quezon, will immensely contribute to a 
much, much better administrative set-up, culminating in the process accHprsti™ ~f +u • . 
agricultural and industrial developments of the two afeas; conSde^

A RESOLUTION REQUESTING HIS EXCELLENCY PRESIDEN1 "FERDINAND E r MARCOS TO 
CREATE THE SUBPROVINCE OF AURORA INTO A REGULAR PROVINCE BY PRbblULIN IAL 
DECREE 

WHEREAS, the New Constitution of the Philippines and the proposed Local Governments Code 
provide and recognize only four (4) forms of Local Governments namely: prov.nce, cities, municipalities and 

barangavs and no subprovince: , . , , 

WHEREAS, for 23 long years Aurora had been a subprovince and the only subprovince not converted 
into a regular province, sharing 30% of all provincial taxes; fines and other revenue collected within its 
boundaries; including 30% of Internal Revenue Allotment as provided for under Sec. 2142 ot the 
Administrative Code which otherwise could have been used for its permanent improvements and benefits; 

WHEREAS, almost all national and provincial government offices had already been organized in Baler, 
the capital town, the subprovince being very much isolated from the rest of Quezon Province, where one 
has to travel through four provinces and six cities to reach the capital city, Lucena; 

WHEREAS, the creation of Aurora into a regular province will give its people the incentive, authority 
and facilities necessary to attain its goal of providing an atmosphere of economic prosperity to all and 
thereby contribute its share in the overall program of the Republic in creating a New Society by making it 
more respective to the needs of the people; 

WHEREAS, the conversion of the Subprovince of Aurora into a regular province is an obsession of its 
inhabitants who have always made it known to visiting high ranking government officials and to His 
Excellency President Ferdinand E. Marcos himself; 

NOW,THEREFORE, on motion of Councilor Bayani D. Sanchez duly seconded by Councilor Jesse P. 
Pimentel; 

BE IT RESOLVED AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED, to respectfully request His Excellency, President 
Ferdinand E.Marcos, to create the Subprovince of Aurora into a regular province by Presidential Decree.

MENSAHE 



Isang walang katulad na kasiyahan ang bumubukal sa akingpuso, dahil 
sa inyong matimyas na pagaalaala at pagpaparangal sa anting minamahal na 
ama, sa ika-sandaang taon ng kanyang kapanganakan. At higit pang 
makabuluhan ang parangal naito, dahil ito'y nagbubuhat sa puso ng mga 
mamamayan ng Baler, ang bayang sinilangan at minahal ng aming butihing 
amcu 

Sa isang anak, ang pinaka-dakilang pamana na maaari niyang tanggapin 
sa kanyang ama, ay ang patuloy at walang kupas na pagpapahalaga ng 
kanyang mga kalahi sa kanyang mga nagawa noong siyay nabubuhay pa, sa 
kanyang naipakitang halimbawa, at sa kanyang pagiging isang tunay na 
Filipino na nagtaguyod sa kadakilaan ng kanyang bayan at kabutihan ng 
kanyang kapuwa Filipino. 

Dahil dito, ako at ang aking kapatid ay taos-pusong nagpapasalamat sa 
inyong mga pagsisikap upang ang mga gintong alaala ng aking ama'y 
manatiling buhay sa kalooban ng lahat na Filipino. Sa inyong pagbibigay ng 
parangal, nawa'y maipalaganap din ninyo ang mga mahahalagang asal at 
layunin, ang mga kapaki-pakinabang na mga simulain at panuntunan na 
iniwan niya sa ating lahat, upang ang mga ito'y magamit natin ngayon sa 
pagtatampok sa kasarinlan, kasaganaan at kapayapaan sa ating bansa.

IMMORTAL WORDS 
OF MANUEL LUIS QUEZON 



"My loyalty to my party ends where my loyalty to my country begins. 99 wmMr » mM » 

'7 prefer a government run like hell by the Filipinos than a government run like heaven by the Americans 
"The voice of the people is the voice of God only when it expresses a judgment formed within the safe 

channels of serene reflection. 99 , „ 

"The rights of the majority as well as the minority should be respected and recognized. 
"We shall build a strong government that will be just, efficient and strong so that the foundations of the 

coming Republic may be firm and enduring - a government indeed 9 that must satisfy not only the 

passing needs of the hour but also the exacting demands of the future. 99 
"A new edifice shall arise, not out of the ashes of the past but out of the standing materials of the living 

present. 99 

"Other peoples of the world are straining themselves to attain higher levels of progress and national 

security. We shall not, we must not lag behind. 99 
"I have a very soft heart but I have a strong will power, and I will not help a boy to become lazy and 

easy-going. 99 n 
"I stopped every kind of abuse of the people known to me, and I assured the common man of protection. 
"I charged large fees to the rich and none whatever to the poor. I lost no cases. 99 

"Before I entered politics, I had a profession, practised it and made a success of it, both from the 
standpoint of my reputation as a competent lawyer and as a lover of justice. 99 

"The position of a fiscal gave only a salary of PI 50. 1 decided to accept it as a call of public duty. 99 

"So long as the nationalistic sentiment is not fostered to the point where a person forgets that it forms a 
part of the human family; that the good of the mankind should be the ultimate aim of all and every 
nation; and that conflicting national interests are temporary and that there is always a just formula for 
adjusting them, nationalism is noble, elevating and most beneficial sentiment. 99 

"Although I am a nationalist, my nationalism is not orthodox. 99 

"I am one of those who believe that Religion exercises a wholesome influence upon man, both as an 

individual and as a citizen. 99 
"My election was practically unanimous though there was a candidate against me and I made no 

compromise. 99 

"We recognize no substitute, admit no alternative, concede no reduction of our righteous demands for the 

absolute independence of the Philippines. 99 
"I have been all around the world. I travel to study . . . my trips are all for the good of the country. 99 
"As a good father, I did not want my children to suffer the hunger and privation that I suffered. 99 
"I came from a poor family. I am a poor man 9 s son. 99

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF 
MAJOR GENERAL PEDRO Q. MOLINA AFP (Ret.) 



Major General Pedro Q. Molina, a statuesque military officer 
whose quiet dignity and most unassuming manners have elicited a lot 
of respect and admiration from among his comrades-in-arms and 
even evoked faster heartbeats from among our womankind here- 
abouts, might very well be considered as another "Star of Baler! " 
Of course, he did not have the flair for dramatics and spectacle that 
his uncle, President Manuel L. Quezon, had - but all the same, his 
military career was an enviable and impressive record of achieve- 
ments for which our country has benefitted in no small measure. 
Indeed, his career was replete with outstanding and monumental 
achievements, even if these have sometimes escaped public notice 
because they were characterized by quiet pageantry. His deeds 
during World War II which won for him a Purple Heart and several 
other medals and decorations; his own gallant stand in Bataan as a 
simple soldier, and his survival from the infamous Death March and 
the concentration camp in Capas — all these, and more, were not 
"heroic exploits" to him but merely a "part of the day's work! " 
Looking through his modesty and humility in our search for truth 
and meaning, it can be said — and it will not be denied - that for 
sheer merit as a dedicated soldier and career man in the military; as a 
patriot par excellence, he can stand tall and erect, distinctive and 
glorious deserving so richly all the honors bestowed 

In the annals of our military history, it is written that it was 
during General Molina's stewardship that the Philippine Air Force 
had finally arrived. . .into the jet-age; that it was he who made the 
"first steps" towards its expansion, its revitalization and its 
modernization. The jet combat planes that are guarding and 
maintaining peace in our skies, and the technical strength of our 
Air-Arm today can be happily traced back and be attributed to his 
vision, insight, grit and determination. Among the many contri- 
butions that can be credited to him were the establishment of the 
PAF Flying School; the PAF Technical School, the Air Command 
and Staff School, and the country's first Air Defense and Warning 
System. 

General Molina's educational preparation goes back to his days 
at the Ateneo de Manila where he finished his grade school and high 
school. His military training began at the Philippine Constabulary 
Academy (now the Philippine Military Academy) and, later, he 
joined the Philippine Army Flying School where he graduated as a 
military pilot 

Studies abroad enriched his military training further. He 
graduated as military pilot from US Army Flying Schools: at 
Randolph and Kelly Fields, and at Enid Field, Oklahoma. He took 
up other aviation courses at Tyndall Air Force, Florida; at Air 
Command and Staff College, Air University (USAF) in Maxwell Air 
Force Base, Alabama, and at Southern Pines, North Carolina. 

In addition to this extensive aviation training, he also took up 
the Civil Air Transport Course at the American University in 
Washington, D.C., and for good measure, he had observation trips 
and special studies on the air transportation of Australia, of the 
United States and of Canada. 

General Molina held various positions of responsibility, 
rising from rank to rank in the Philippine Air Force: as Junior 
Officer, as Staff Officer, then as commander in the different levels of 
the Command. He moved on from the Squadron to the Group, and 
then to the Wing, till finally he assumed the position of 



Commanding General, a position he held in the PAF for five 
consecutive years. He moved on further when he was appointed 
Deputy Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and 
subsequently Vice Chief of Staff, with the rank of Major General. 

While serving as a major keyman in the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines, he represented our country in several vital conferences 
abroad. He was a member of the Philippines-US Mutual Defense 
Board, as Commander of the Eastern Region-SEATO, and also a 
member of the PI Delegation to a SEATO Conference in Karachi, 
Pakistan. 

General Molina closed his quiet but distinguished military 
career after having served the Armed Forces of the Philippines for 
thirty years. On July 4, 1964, he retired from active service in the 
military. And all told, his career has been resplendent with medals of 
distinction and various other decorations awarded by our own 
government and by foreign countries. Among the honors bestowed 



upon him were: 


1. 


Distinguished Conduct Star 


2. 


Distinguished Service Cross (US) 


3. 


Distinguished Service Star with 2 Banahaw Oak Leaf 




(BAL) 


4. 


Legion of Merit (Degree of Commander) U.S.

Indeed, General Molina's retirement at age 48 was a loss to the 
military. But he turned to be a mighty gain to private civilian 
endeavors. His expertise in things aeronautical, his counsel, and the 
inspiration he has never failed to generate have continued to be a 
blessing to our country. 

After his retirement, he helped organize AIR MANILA, INC. 
as Vice President for Traffic and Sales. He also helped established 
Aerospace Power. Today, as President of National Aero Manufac- 
turing Corporation, General Molina is continuing to help not only 
the government but also the hundreds of private aircraft owners in 
our republic. 

Major General Pedro Q. Molina, born in Baler March 30, 1916, 
is the oldest son of Teodorico Molina with whom he is blessed with 
three daughters and a son.

BRIEF HISTORY 



OF 
BALER 



/ 



On the northeastern part of Tayabas (now Quezon Province), 
lies a relatively small town; located at the mouth of a horseshoe 
valley nestling in the Caraballo Range of the Sierra Madre Moun- 
tains. On its eastern part is the Pacific Ocean. 

A. Legend 

According to the Noceda San Lugar, a Spanish dictionary 
printed in 1860 explaining the nature and origin of Spanish terms, 
the word "Baler" came from the term "balod," a kind of paloma 
monies which means "mountain dove," a type which was once 
abundant in the area, making it a "craddle of balod." This legend is 
the most popular and wide accepted even by \heSurian ng Wikang 
Pambansa. 

Other legends explaining the origin of the town of Baler 
include an old woman who was met by a group of Spanish soldiers 
who landed in the area and who asked the former what the name of 
the place. She responded "Vale" thinking that the soldiers 
were asking what her name was. Also, the early natives of the place 
used to call the lowland "balid" meaning "to return" an expression 
they uttered every time they would arrive from their travels in the 
surrounding mountains. However, many old people of the town 
believe that the origin of the name "baler" could be traced from the 
regime of Lakan Balid before the Spaniards came, and during the 
time of Fray Valeriano who was responsible for the founding of the 
barangay. 

B. Founding of the Town 

The founding of Baler dates back to the year 1609 with the 
coming of seven intrepid Franciscan missionaries led by Fray Bias 
Palomino who penetrated the thick forests of the eastern part of 
Caraballo Mountains. Under the leadership of Fray Francisco de San 
Antonio, other places near the bay were ministered in 1611. This 
small settlement was improved by the Augustinians and the 
Recollects who arrived in 1658. In 1703, the administration of the 
town was given back to the Franciscans due to the scarcity of 
religious missionaries in the country. 

This town was orginally situated at the right of a river named 
San Jose which had its source in the Caraballo Mountains and flows 
west to east into a big bay which was later named after the town. 
The early inhabitants of this town were mostly farmers, fishermen, 
gatherers of honey-bee and hunters numbering to 35,000 more or 
less. For trade purposes, the natives reached as far asGapan, Nueva 
Ecija as Baler was then a principal town of "El Principe," a district 
of the province of Nueva Ecija. 

On September 27, 1735, Baler was completely demolished by 
Tromba Marina, a phenomenal tidal wave that had left only fourteen 
families. Among them were the Lumasac, Angara, Bitong, Carrasco, 
Poblete and the Bijasa. Led by the town missionary, Fray Jose de 



Rafael thev swam to a neighboring hill, just by the side of the 
tow r the'wLr had subsided, the survivors decided to resettle 
in the site by the sea which they called "k.nagunasan meaning 
"devastated." Later, they decided to resettle in a new site which is 
now the poblacion of Baler. 

In the year 1798, a strong force of Moro pirates that had 
headquarters in Burias Islands and Ticao attacked the village of Baler 
and other towns on the eastern coast of Luzon. The towns were 
devastated; about 450 people were held captive, including three 
parish priests, one of whom was allegedly sold. 

Long before the Muslim invasion, the site of the demolished 
church of Baler with the town's patron, San Luis Obispo de ToIosq 
was made the site of the new church, built largely of stones and 
bricks This was the old but historically legendary garrison during 
the Spanish regime. It existed until the last month of 1939 when the 
concrete foundation of the new church was laid, as the old church 
was almost eroding and falling into pieces. The new church (which 
exists up to the present) was built through the initiative of the late 
President Quezon, his wife Dona Aurora and their family and friends 
and with the cooperative efforts of the townspeople. 

To the old folks, the church of Baler which they called La 
Iglesia de Baler" had been a very significant defense during the 
revolutions and the wars. The story of the old church had been 
portrayed in a movie-slide for cultural presentation bearing the title 
"La Campana de Baler," taken during the late fifties. 

The significance of the town of Baler in the history of the 
country is revealed in a marker installed by the Philippine Historical 
Commission at the church of the town reading; 

A Spanish garrison of four officers and fifty 
besieged in this church by Filipino insurgents from June 2 , 
1899. Offers of peace and demand were refused on five 
occasions. From newspapers dropped into the court by an 
emissary of General Rios on May 29, the garrison learned to 
the first time that the Philippines had been lost to Spain ana 
for many months there had been no Spanish flag in L uz0 
except the one waving over the Baler church. Broke 
starvation, tropical disease and depleted command arranged 
truce with insurgents and marched out of the church aero 
the mountains to Manila on June 2, 1899. Off the or«^ 
garrison, two officers, the priest and twelve men had W 
killed by insurgent bullets, two men had been wounded; $ 
men had deserted. The fortitude of the garrison was praised r 
General Emilio Aguinaldo in a public document atTarlac 
June 20, 1899. Upon the return to Spain the survivors ** 
rewarded by the Queen Regent in the name of Alfonso *■ 



and the Spanish nation. 



C. Present Status of the Town 

Upon the arrival of the Carmelite Missionaries to the Philip- 
pines in 1947, the town was placed under their supervision on 
matters of mission work. A group of American Carmelite priests 
under the leadership of Msgr. Patrick Shanley came to the area upon 
the request of the late Dona Aurora Aragon Quezon who then 
realized the need for evangelical mission in the area. 

Since 1951, Baler remains to be the capital town of the 
Subprovince of Aurora. It is 232 kilometers from the city of Manila. 
Its area had been decreased tremendously for its big barrios such as 
Maria Aurora, Dipaculao, San Luis and Dingalan had been converted 
into separate municipalities. It has a total land area of 8,565 
hectares, making a total of eight barrios: Buhangin, Sabang, 
Calabuanan, Suklayin, Zabali, Pingit, Reserva and Obligacion. 

There are four main rivers in the vicinity of the town: Agwang 
in the north; Duongan in the east; Kinalapan in the southwestern 
part of the poblacion and Suklayin Creek in the western portion of 
the town. 

Significant landmarks, natural beauties and scenic spots found 
in the area include the birthplace of the late President Manuel Luis 
Quezon which has been converted into the Quezon Memorial Park 
found in the heart of the town. At the center of this park is found a 
marker bearing a short life account of the late president. This is 
where the house of the Quezons once stood, a relatively small 
house, made of wood, bamboo and nipa materials. In the event of 
time, the place was made the center of the peopled recreation and a 
place for remembering the good hero. 

The Roman Catholic Church is situated just south of the park. 



In its vicinity stands the Mount Carmel College, the only educational 
institution of higher learning in the Subprovince of Aurora. 

In the eastern part of the town is a beautiful and long beach 
along coconut grooves. The beach ranges from the southern portion 
of Casiguran, and flows to Dinalungan and Dipaculao, southward. In 
the southern part of the beach, Bo. Cemento is located. Cemento is 
one of the most scenic spots in the region, with its picnic resorts by 
the foot of the hills and mountains. The beach has been blessed with 
corrals and reefs. Here, the vacation house of the Quezon family 
once stood. 

Just at the foot of Mount Castillo, a hill in the southern part 
of the town, is located a cave which the people call Cave of Santa 
Isabel, named after the patroness of the barrio. This cave is said to 
have been built by Fray Jose de Esparagoza during the height of the 
Muslim invasion of the place in the eighteenth century. 

On top of the hill, ruins of an old chapel could be seen. This 
place is said to have been used for religious rites in honor of the 
patroness of the barrio. The old town was demolished during 
the phenomenal tidal wave. From this place, one can see the whole 
bay and the town, as well as the neighboring barrios and towns. 

Other spots in the town are now beingdeveloped and improved 
for tourists attraction. 

This is Baler, a small town which cannot be forgotten by many 
people, it being the birth place of the late President Manuel Luis 
Quezon, the father of Philippine Independence, the promoter of 
social justice and the father of the Filipino National Language. It 
cannot be forgotten in the country's history for it once served as the 
last seat of Spanish conquest in the Philippines.

By FEDERICO LICSI ESPINO, JR. 



The Commonwealth era is probably one of the most colorful 
chapters in our history. It was an age during which the country was 
engulfed by a flood of resurgent nationalistic ideas. It was an age 
which saw many colorful personalities, the arresting if suave 
Osmena, the brilliant Laurel, the engrossing Recto and a host of 
other political luminaries. But in this galaxy of brilliant men, one 
star outshined the rest, the man who is often referred to as the star 
of Baler, President Manuel Luis Quezon. 

Much of the color of the Commonwealth era was due to 
Quezon, a man with a dynamic, many-faceted personality. A Don 
Juan among chief of states, his personality was of the sort which 
made an immediate impact the first time one talked with him. This 
arresting personality was further enhanced by his Beau Brummelish 
choice of clothes. Two writers once said of him: . . Quezon's 
exemplariness did not stop in his being considered an ideal 
politician; his sartorial perfection was noted by persons appreciative 
of the niceties of attire; and like the old Roman hedonist and the 
young Prince of Wales, he became the arbiter elegantiarum of his 
people." 

The Quezonian temper is well-known and so are the Que- 
zonian invectives. One famous outburst of this temper has been 
recounted by the American colonial careerist, George Malcolm in his 
book: 

"The colorful and momentous event took place before 
distinguished guests and a mass assembly estimated at a quarter of a 
million people. Only one hitch developed in the carefully planned 
program (the induction into office of Quezon). At the glorious 
moment when Quezon was to sign the oath of office as President of 
the Philippines. he turned to his indispensable secretary Jorge B. 
Vargas for pens — and no pens were forthcoming. A lusty Quezonian 
curse rent the microphones and signed the embarrassed "George." 

Indeed, the Quezonian invectives become part of the Quezon 
legend. But probably nobody has understood the invective as much 
as Manuel Nieto, Quezon's intimate friend and bodyguard. Nieto's 
appraisal of Quezon's flair for his invectives is very revealing: 
"President Quezon's curse is more of a benediction than a 
malediction." 

Another outburst of the Quezonian temper was recounted by 
Carlos Quirino in his Quezon, Man of Destiny: 

'The editor of a newspaper in Spanish, La Democracia, had 
been attacking Quezon for his record as fiscal of Mindoro. The 
attacks were so servilous that on January 7, 1909, Quezon, 
accompanied by Assemblymen Juan Villamor and Lerma, paid a call 
to the editorial offices of the newspaper. Upon seeing the editor, 
Quezon held him by the neck, shook him as a terrier would shake a 
rat, then pushed him away so vigorously that he fell to the floor. 
Mutual friends separated the two assailants." 



But if Quezon was temperamental and vengeful with his 
enemies he was extremely kind with friends and old classmates. If 
today there is a civil service regulation providingthatemployeeswho 
have served the government for at least 30 years be exempt from 
taking the civil service examination, it was because Quezon did not 
want an ex-classmate to be removed from the government service 
because he was not a civil service eligible. This friend of Quezon, an 
old clerk connected with the Cavite court of first instance, went to 
Quezon once to inform him that he is being asked by the Civil 
Service to vacate his job because he did not take the tests. The clerk 
said he was too old to memorize and that he could perform his job 
better than afresh civil service eligible. 

Greatly moved by his answer, Quezon phoned the commis- 
sioner of civil service and asked him to make a ruling exempting old 
government employes from taking the test. 

But above all, Quezon was an extraordinary politician. His 
persuasive powers were phenomenal and although he may not be as 
great as a statesman as Sergio Osmena who later on became President 
during the twilight of the Commonwealth Era, he was a dynamic 
politician. But like all politicians, he had his faults. 

It was he who introduced the junket system into Philippine 
politics. Then taking a cue from that off-shoot of Andrew Jackson's 
politician credo, the so-called spoil system, he introduced it to the 
country. His inauguration speech when he became president of the 
Philippine Senate after the elections which according to Isabelo P. 
Caballero and M. de Gracia Concepcion "left much to be desired 
from the standpoint of clean politics" is a classic expression of the 
Jacksonian theory: 

"The will of the majority, being known through the result of 
an election, that majority elevated to power must be given all 
opportunity to carry out its program. Thus it is just, nay, even 
essential that the victorious majority should occupy the admi- 
nistrative offices, the same as it has obtained the elective positions." 

Another thing Quezon introduced into Philippine politics was 
the press bureau of Quezon, more than anybody else knew the 
value of good publicity through the mass media. He also knew 
harmful effects of bad publicity and because of this.membersof the 
press who were hostile towards him became his enemy. It IS 
interesting to note that Francisco Varona, one time editor of La 
Vanguardia, lost his job because of an editorial critizicing Quezon s 
gloomy monomania which would serve eternally as a shadow to 
his name. . 

But despite his faults, Quezon was a nationalist of the first 
order. The history of our struggle for independence cannot be retold 
without mentioning his name. He was mainly responsible for the 
W° the J° n es Law in 1916 and the Tydings-McDuffie Law m 

And this is perhaps the best index of his nationalism.

STAR OF BALER 



His fierce struggle for freedom and independence has touched our lives, and indeed, all of us owe 
him a debt of gratitude. 

Because of him and his relentless crusade, the Filipino people can at long last, actually seek their 
place in the sun. With his inspiration we, as a people, will continue to strive for higher ideals — and 
life, as before, will continue to be a full of heroism. 

Because of him, we, as a people or as a single individuals will never again be apologetic nor 
afraid!

Man's success in his profession is measured not in terms of gold and influence. It is in the amount 
he gives of himself to others that others may enjoy more of life. To the people he serves Dr. 
Romeo T. Chua exemplies this philosophy of giving oneself to others. 

Dr. Chua rose from the ranks. A graduate Of the UST College of Medicine, he was appointed as 
Jumor Resident Physician of the Aurora Memorial Hospital in 1964 He became a Senior 
Resident Physician that same year. He was promoted to Chief of the Aurora Memorial Hospital in 
1976 and the people feel happy for him. It is a hard-earned, well-deserved promotion. Since 1970 
the Aurora Memorial Hospital is literally a one-doctor hospital. And it is a source of wonder 
among patients and observers how Dr. Chua could remain fresh, calm, and comforting after a 
24-hour service. 5 

Several development projects have been completed under his administration These include the 
dormitory for the staff, .he 25-bed annex, the concrete fence and ta*o£taXj££ta! 
of modern equipment, and staff development. The hospital has assumed a nT' f

FATHER OF ALL MANKIND, We ask you to look upon your people,/ and fill our 
hearts with your spirit,/ that we may have the grace/ and the wisdom to look into 
ourselves,/ and in so doing,/ see our weaknesses and our stmiths./ 

So many of us have lived in corruption/ greed and violence,/ forgetting that this 
nation — unless we learn to live as brothers,/ striving not for selfish ends,/ but for the 
common good. 

Give us strength to rebuild our lives,/ leaving forever our selfish,/ corrupt and 
derelict ways. 

Make us see what we are/ and what we could be,/ open our eyes,/ our minds and 
our hearts/ to the things that need to be done,/ and the things we can do/ to make this 
rich and beautiful land/ a joy and comfort to all our people. 

We have set for ourselves/ great and never-ending tasks;/ stand by us in our 
labors,/ and teach us not to weary/ nor lose our faith,/ neither to seek the full measure 
of our own reward beyond what is just,/ but rather to see in our work/ the full measure 
of our own reward,/ and see in it/ the full expression of ourselves. 

When the day's toil is ended,/ teach us to look to the morrow's labor/ as part of 
our continuing sacrifice;/ bring us not to the temptation of luxury,/ ease or privilege,/ 
nor to the brandishments of power or comfort that corrupt;/ but make of us a sturdy 
race,/ self reliant,/ cheerful and upright. 

Teach those who lead/ to act with firmness/ but with humility,/ with humility but 
with wisdom/ with wisdom but with justice,/ and with justice/ but with compassion,/ 
and teach those who follow/ the true duties of being men/ and members of a 
community of men. 

Cleanse us of our anger,/ our bitterness,/ and our recriminations of the past,/ 
spare us the doubts and anxieties of the present;/ and purify us for our sacrifice/ so 
that we may raise a people/ who will be their own warranty against the future. 



President FERDINAND E. MARCOS 




A seldom seen and little known picture of a devoted husband and a loving father. Infant in the 
arms of Dona Aurora is the late Maria Aurora "Baby". 





OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT 



On September 21, 1972, the Philippine Republic 
launched a programme to build a New Society. Reforms 
were instituted while social order was restored. Political 
stability was ensured under a New Constitution. Land 
reform was implemented throughout the country and new 
policies gave impetus to economic development Within 
the short historical span of five years, a great deal of 
change and progress now stand in marked contrast to the 
preceding four and a half centuries of colonial exploitation 
and the twenty-six years of oligarchic rule. 

The significance of contemporary developments in 
the Philippines affair extends beyond the dramatic interest 
invoked by the proclamation of martial law. Through all 
spheres of national life, changes of momentous importance 
to the future of institutions have already had considerable 
impact on people's lives. The New Society demands more, 
however, than government revamp and economic planning 
it requires that a new Filipino should arise from all ranks. 
President Marcos has written, The step towards demo- 
cratic revolution is a moral one . . . Everyone is guilty. 
Social corruption exists because of general consent and 
toleration. This is the full moral perception of the 
revolution that has been bequeathed to us\ It is this heroic 
challenge for a New Filipino that confronts the youth, the 
second generation of democratic revolutionaries, today. 

On April 15, 1975, the Kabataang Barangay was 
invested by Presidential Decree 684 into this sacred 
national duty. A youth force of seven million 15 to 21 - 
year olds have been endowed with the youngest voting age 
in the world, a serious participatory role in all levels of 
local and national assembly, and a though-going equality 
with the senior barangay members. The alienation and 
agitation of the 60's and the early 70's had at last been 



recognized, and the young were restored in trust and 
participation in government. Once again, President Marcos 
asserted. "Many have asked me about succession. . . I have 
answered the Kabataang Barangay, 'You are my political 
heirs'. 

Five years after the New Society's inception, on 
September 21, 1977, the Kabataang Barangay has seen fit 
to respond to the national challenge and proclaimed its 
own Constitution. Fired by the spirit of 'Makialam! Ikaw 
and bagong Pilipino' the KB has evolved anew con- 
sciousness (Kamalayan) and a new productivity (Kaka- 
yahan). 

1.) Firstly, consciousness, involvement and parti- 
cipation all require a knowledge of every individual's 
responsibility in barangay and nationwide undertakings. 
Hence, the KB Constitution acclaims the National Asr 
sembly of 42,000 Chairmen and their subsequent member- 
ship as the supreme mass base of the entire movement 
From them all power and leadership emanates. It is this 
mass grouping which must be called to formulate all KB 
decisions. It the most important body in the Kabataang 
Barangay and the constitution maintains it as the youth's 
fundamental grassroots. 

For each city and province, a Federation President is 
elected to compose the National Council which recom- 
mends programmes and policies to the Department of 
Local Government and Community Development During 
the annual convention or other special convention called 
by its members, the council studies the Assembly's 
decision in operational and working terms. 
m Fi , n * lly > to im Plement the programmes and policies a 
National Executive Committee made up of all 12 Regional 
federation Presidents and the Metro Manila Federation 



President is formed to constantly coordinate with the KB 
Secretariat and the Senior Barangays. Once every three 
months, they meet to evaluate existing programmes and 
when necessary a special convention may be called. This 
13-man body acts as the KB representation to the Batasang 
Bayan. Thus through this inverted pyramid organizational 
mechanism the KB hopes to forge youth's legitimacy in 
Philippine government 

President Marcos elucidates on the principle of 
youth participation, Sometime ago, I was asked why I 
included 15-year olds. . .in assemblies that decide the fate 
of our nation. My answer was that I wanted to combine 
the wisdom of the young with the foolishness of the old. 

To serve the barangay better and live up to the 
"Makialam' thrust, KBs community projects, are assured 
of insurance coverage for chairmen. 

"The promise of a new beginning in a society has 
dawned among us. And yet, whatever promises there are 
can only be realized if we learn to play our vital role in the 
society. 

The Kabataang Barangay offers us a means through 
which our talents, ideals, vigor and visions could be 
channeled to effective participation in the advancement of 
a new social order. 

Move into action! Do your part/ The progress of 
our people and our nation rests in the tenacity of our 
involvement in the Kabataang Barangay. 

The tasks we need to accomplish are formidable. Our 
path is strewn with thousand obstacle. Many times along 



the way, our consciousness will be dimmed by misgivings, 
frustrations, hopelesness, and pain. 

But we are young and we alone posses the strength 
to conquer frustrations and hopelesness. 

Remember our brothers and sisters in the Kabataang 
Barangay who, like us are confronted with the same social 
ills that need to be eradicated. They strive vigilantly to 
realize the ideals of the Kabataang Barangay through 
various activities geared towards social generation and 
national development Remember - our strength is their 
strength, our dream is their dream; in the service of our 
fellowmen we are one. 

Deeper commitment and involvement in national 
development is now our concern. The Kabataang Barangay 
will help us span the depths and heights of relevant 
involvement and commitment to the cause of national 
development Bear in mind that development is not only 
growth, it is also a change in basic attitudes of our people 
that they may become receptive to innovations in society 
and government 

Our role therefore, is focal in national development 
and social change. Strike at the roots of social ills-inequity, 
oppression, injustice, and discontent, and build for our- 
selves, our prople and posterity a new nation, a new 
society. 

In the interest of our people, the advancement of 
social change and national development, strengthen your 
commitment to the Kabataang Barangay — the living 
conscience of the present-day Philippine society."

INAUGURAL ADDRESS OF 
HIS EXCELLENCY MANUEL L QUEZON 
ON NOVEMBER 15, 1935 



FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: In the exercise of your 
constitutional prerogative you have elected me to the 
presidency of the Common wealth. I am profoundly 
grateful for this new expression of your confidence, and 
God helping me I shall not fail you. 

The event which is now taking place in our midst 
transcends in importance the mere induction into office of 
your Chief Executive. We are seeing the fruition of our 
age-old striving for liberty. We are witnessing the final 
stage in the fulfillment of the noblest undertaking ever 
attempted by any nation in its dealing with a subject 
people. And how well this task has been performed is 
attested to by the blessings from fourteen million people 
which go to America in this solemn hour. President 
McKinley's cherished hope has been fulfilled - the 
Filipinos look back with gratitude to the day when 
Destiny placed their land under the beneficent guidance of 
the people of the United States. 

It is fitting that high dignitaries of the American 
Government should attend these ceremonies. We are 
thankful to them for their presence here, The President of 
the United States, His Excellency, Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
ever solicitous of our freedom and welfare, has sent to us, 
as his personal representative, the Secretary of War, 
Honorable George H. Dern, whose friendship for our 
people has proven most valuab le in the past. Vice President 
Garner, Speaker Byrns, distinguished members of the 
House of Representatives have traveled ten thousand miles 
to witness this historic event. I feel that by their presence 
the whole American Nation s here today to rejoice with us 
in the fulfillment of America's pledge generously given 
that the Filipino people is to become free and in- 
dependent. It is my hope that the ties of friendship and 
affection which bind the Philippines to America will 
remain unbroken and grow stronger after the severance of 
our political relations with her. 

In behalf of the Filipino people, I express deep 
appreciation to Honorable Frank Murphy, our last 
Governor General for his just and efficient administration 
and for the wholehearted assistance he has rendered us in 
the difficult task of laying th«e constitutional foundations 
of our new Government. 

As we enter upon the threshold of independent 
nationhood, let us pause for a moment to pay tribute to 
the memory of Rizal and Bonifacio and all the heroes of 
our sacred cause in grateful acknowledgement of their 
patriotic devotion and supreme sacrifice. 

Fellow countrymen: The government which we are 
inaugurating today is onl y a means to an end. It is an 
instrumentality placed in cur hands to prepare ourselves 
fully for the responsibilities of complete independence. It 
is essential that this last step be taken with full conscious- 



ness of its significance and the great opportunity is that it 
affords to us. 

Under the Commonwealth, our life may not be one of 
the ease and comfort, but rather of hardship and sacrifice. 
We shall face the problems which lie in our path, sparing 
neither time nor effort in solving them. We shall build a 
government that will be just, honest, efficient, and strong 
so that the foundations of the coming Republic may be 
firm and enduring — a government, indeed, that must 
satisfy not only the passing needs of the hour but also the 
exacting demands of the future. We do not have to tear 
down the existing institutions in order to give way to a 
statelier structure. There will be no violent changes from 
the established order of things, except such as may be 
absolutely necessary to carry into effect the innovations 
contemplated by the Constitution. A new edifice shall 
arise, not out of the ashes of the past, but out of the 
standing materials of the living present. 

Reverence for law as the expression of the popular will 
is the starting point in a democracy. The maintenance of 
peace and public order is the joint obligation of the 
government and the citizen. I have an abiding faith in the 
good sense of the people and in their respect for law and 
the constituted authority. Widespread public disorder and 
lawlessness may cause the downfall of constitutional 
government and lead to American intervention. Even after 
independence, if we should prove ourselves incapable of 
protecting life, liberty, and property of nationals and 
foreigners, we shall be exposed to the danger of inter- 
vention by foreign powers. No one need have any 
misgivings as to the attitude of the Government toward 
lawless individuals or subersive movements. They shall be 
dealth with firmly. Sufficient armed forces will be main- 
tained at all times to quell and suppress any rebellion 
against the authority of this Government or the 
sovereignty of the United States. 

There can be no progress except under the auspices of 
peace. Without peace and public order it will be impossible 
to promote education, improve the condition of the 
masses, protect the poor and ignorant against exploi- 
tat,on, and otherwise insure the enjoyment of life, 
liberty, and property. I appe al, therefore, to every Filipino 
to give the Government his loyal support so that 
tranquility may reign supreme in our beloved land 

Our Constitution establishes an independent judiciary 
by providing for security of tenure and compensation of 
our judges. But independence is not the only objective of a 
good judiciary Equally, if not more important, is its 
integrity which will depend upon the judicious selection of 
its members. The administration of justice cannot be 

TnH rH f T high6r than the moral ^ intellectual 
standards of the men who dispense it. To bulwark the 



fortification of an orderly and just government, it shall be 
my task to appoint to the bench only men of proven 
honesty, character, learning, and ability, so that every one 
may feel when he appears before the courts of justice that 
he will be protected in his rights, and that no man inn this 
country from the Chief Executive to the last citizen is 
above the law. 

We are living to-day amidst the storm and stress of one 
of the most tragic epochs of history. Acute unemployment 
and economic distress threaten the stability of govern- 
ments the world over. The very foundations of civilized 
society are shaken. The common man alone can save 
humanity from disaster. It is our duty to prove to him that 
under a republican system of government he can have 
every opportunity to attain his happiness and that of his 
family. Protection to labor, especially to working women 
and minors, just regulation of the relations between labor 
and capital in industry and agriculture, solicitous regard on 
the part of the government for the well-being of the masses 
are the means to bring about the needed economic and 
social equilibrium between the component elements of 
society. 

A government draws the breath of life from its 
finances, and it must balance its income and expenditures 
as any other going business concern if it expects to survive. 
It is my duty, then, to see that the Government of the 
Commonwealth live within its means and that it stand 
four-square on a well balanced budget. 

The larger expenditures which the grave responsibilities 
ahead of us will entail, including national defense, must be 
borne by taxation. So long as we are able to meet those 
responsibilities from our present income we shall not 
impose new taxes. But we are among the least taxed 
people in the world and therefore, when necessity arise, we 
should be willing to accept the burden of increased 
taxation. Liberty and indepence can be possessed only by 
those who are ready to pay the price in life or fortune. 

To enable us more adequately to meet the new 
responsiblities of the Commonwealth and to raise the 
living conditions of our people, we must increase the 
wealth of the Nation by giving greater impetus to 
economic development, improving our methods of agricul- 
ture, diversifying our crops, creating new industries, and 



fostering our domestic and foreign commerce. I trust that 
the forthcoming trade conference between representatives 
of the United States and the Philippines will result in a 
more just and beneficial commercial relations between the 
two countries. 

The establishment of an economical, simple, and 
efficient government; the maintenance of an independent 
civil service; the implantation of an adequate system of 
public instruction to develop moral character, personal 
discipline, civic conscience, and vocational efficiency; the 
safeguarding of the health and vigor of the race; the 
conservation and development of our natural resources — 
these and other matters of equal import are touched upon 
at length in the platform of the Coalition and in my speech 
of acceptance of my nomination, and it is unnecessary for 
me to reiterate my views regarding them. Having been 
elected on virtuality of that platform and the policies 
enunciated by me in the course of the presidential 
campaign renew my pledge faithfully to carry them into 
execution. 

Good-will towards all nations shall be the golden rule 
of my administration. The peoples of the earth are 
interdependent and their prosperity and happiness are 
inseparably linked with each other. Amity and friendship, 
fairness and square deal in our relations with other nations 
and their citizens or subjects, protection in their legitimate 
investments and pursuits, in return for their temporary 
allegiance to our institutions and laws, are the assurances I 
make on behalf of the New Government to Americans and 
foreigners who may desire to live, trade, and otherwise 
assocaite with us in the Philippines. 

In the enourmous taks of fully preparing ourselves for 
independence we shall be beset with serious difficulties, 
but we will resolutely march forward. I appeal to your 
patriotism and summon your nobility of heart so that we 
may, united in the common endeavor, once more dedicate 
ourselves to the realization of our national destiny. I face 
the future with hope and fortitude, certain that God never 
abandons a people who ever follow His unerring and 
guiding Hand. May He give me light, strength, and courage 
evermore that I may not falter in the hour of service to 
my people.

President Quezon addressing the House of Representatives on June 
2, 1942. He said that death, ruin and destruction had not daunted the 
spirit of the Filipinos. 




MANUEL LUIS QUEZON 
(1878-1944) 



On August 19, 1878, the village of Baler, a little town on the 
eastern coast of Luzon, was peaceful - but not quiet Church bells 
were ringing, for it was the town fiesta, an annual celebration in 
honor of San Luis de Tolosa, a bishop of the Catholic church. At 
seven o'clock that morning, as the bells were pealing their glad songs, 
a baby boy was born. 

Lucio Quezon, the father of the child, was from Penafrancia in 
the southern district of Manila, and of a Spanish father and a 
Filipino mother. After terminating his service as a sergeant in the 
Spanish army stationed in various parts of the country, he decided 
to try his luck anew which prompted him to emigrate to Baler,, 
where he met and married Maria Dolores Molina, a Spanish mestiza. 
Both of them were school teachers in the only local school in Baler. 

The newly born child was baptized at the local church baptistry 
and was registered MANUEL LUIS QUEZON. His first teacher was 
his mother from whom he learned to read and write Spanish, 
arithmetic, spelling and catechism or the fundamentals of the 
Roman Catholic faith. His mother was a very devout woman, had 
planned eventually to steer the young Manuel Luis into the 
priesthood. 

At seven, the young Quezon started his formal schooling at the 
convent adjoining the stone church with Fray Teodoro Fernandez, 
the Franciscan parish priest. The boy stayed with this friar for three 
years where he was taught history, goegraphy, religion and Latin. 

Two years later, Father Fernandez was transferred to the 
congregation's main convent in Intramuros, Manila. His young 
convent or mess boy Manuel went him and was given quarters at the 
friar's compound in the Walled City while studying at the nearby 
Colegio de San Juan de Letran, a preparatory boys's school operated 
by the Dominican missionaries. A year later, he started to live with 
an aunt in Paco, as the good father was again transferred to the 
provinces. Later, since it was too far to walk four times a day to and 
from school for an eleven-year old boy, Don Lucio decided to place 
Manuel Luis as a boarder in the school where he was confirmed at 
the age of fourteen with a certain Dr. Rafael Bertol, his tutor in 
mathematics, as his godfather. 

On Febraury 24, 1894, Manuel finished Bachiller en Artes at 
Colegio de San Juan de Letran with highest honors. He was then 
sixteen. A few years later he obtained a certificate as a Surveyor. 

After spending a short vacation at Baler, and after the death of 
his mother, he decided to enrol at the University of Santo Tomas. 
He worked as a capista or tutor to backward students in return for 
free tuition and board and lodging. This was made possible due to 
the assistance granted by Fray Serapio Tamayo, his former professor 
in Letran who was in-charge of the interns at the university. 

During his stay at the university, Quezon made many friends 
among his classmates and in the grades ahead of him like Vicente 
Madrigal of Bicol, Juan Sumulong of Antipolo, Vicente Singson 
Encarnacion of llocos Sur, Emilio Jacinto and Flaviano Yengko. 
Jacinto and Yengko were already members of the Katipunan, the 



former, writing in Bonifacio's propaganda sheet, Kalayaan. The 
young Quezon also became friend to Sergio Osmena, a mestizo 
Sangley from Cebu, who later became his greatest political rival. 

During his first year in UST, he studied under the influence of 
two outstanding professors, Fray Farpon, a physics and chemistry 
teacher, and Fray Valentin Marin, who taught Spanish literature. 
Farpon was a true scientist while Marin was a scholar well-versed not 
only in literature, but also possessed of liberal ideas that made him 
to become a shining exception in that period of religious and 
political bigotry. 

There was a time when the young Quezon, thinking of the 
prophecy of his mother that he was predestined to be a priest and 
that we would serve God by his becoming a priest, enrolled in a 
course in dogmatic theology so as to find out where his true 
vocation was. But there, he met Fray Vaquero, one of his former 
teachers in Letran, who, after recalling the fiery temper and 
mischiefs of the young boy while at Letran, burst into laughter, a 
situation which forced Manuel to drop the course. 

As a vigorous and handsome young man, who would always 
enjoy dancing the kumparsita and enjoy eating his favorite dish 
pork-chicken adobo, the young Quezon usually proved irresistible to 
many a young lady in the city and in the provinces. But this never 
hindered his studies. His stay at the university progressed satisfac- 
torily. For example, in his preparatory law, he won a first prize for 
the course on the critical history of Spain. 

In September 1896, however, all classes in Manila were 
suspended since the revolution had started due to the discovery by 
the Spanish authorities of Bonifacio's secret society — the Kati- 
punan. 

As Manila was deemed severe by the Spanish authorities and 
classes were re-opened in June of the following year, Quezon 
continued his studies at UST as a sophomore law student. However, 
chaos prevailed in the country with the conclusions of the Pact of 
Biak-na-Bato. And on August 13, 1898, Quezon witnsessed the fall 
of Manila. Hence, all schools were closed, a reason which prompted 
him to proceed to Baler, only to discover that his father and his 
younger brother Pedro had been cruelly murdered by bandits 
disguising as revolutionary soldiers. That time the Spanish garrison 
was under siege after having taken refuge in the stone church of 
Baler, the place where the last flag of Spain remained to fly, when 
the rest of the country had fallen. Baler finally fall in May 1899. 

Right at the outbreak of the Spanish-American War, Quezon 
decided at once that "his duty lay in fighting for the freedom of his 
country," and presented himself to Colonel Villacorta in Panta- 
bangan, a small town west from Baler, across the Sierra Madre. He 
was commissioned as second lieutenant. Lt. Quezon became instru- 
mental in pacifying the bandits' unrests in Cabanatuan and other 
parts of Central Luzon. This prompted his superiors to promote him 
to the rank of first lieutenant. He continued to fight in the provinces 
in Central Luzon until he was promoted to the rank of captain. He 



joined the forces of General Aguinaldo stationed in Tarlac. Few 
months later, he was ordered to taken command of the Baguio 
garrison, several miles further to Trinidad. Upon his return to Tarlac, 
he requested General Aguinaldo to send him to the front lines. So he 
found himself with General Mascardo in Porac, a little town in 
Pampanga, then with Colonel Leysan in San Fernando. When 
Mascardo was promoted to succeed the late General Luna as 
commander of all the forces in Central Luzon, he took Leysan as his 
chief of staff, who made Quezon as his staff assistant, and fought in 
the towns of Pampanga, Tarlac and Bataan, Quezon continued to 
join the forces as captain. 

Within a few days after Aguinaldo's capture in Palanan, Isabela, 
on March 23, 1901, General Mascardo called for Quezon and 
promoted him to the rank of major. Although he was later advised 
by the general to surrender because of his poor health, he found 
ways to go to Manila to verify Aguinaldo's capture. Upon seeing his 
Commander-in-Chief, a prisoner, he was stunned and was only able 
to whisper "tapos na ang lahat" (the cause is lost). That was his first 
visit to the palace, now knowing that 34 years later, he will reside 
there as the first president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines 
and leader of his People. He had his first contact with the American 
regime at a large old building in Intramuros, where Filipino officers 
were detained including General Ananias Diokno of Batangas, and 
Servillano Aquino of Tarlac, and Apolinario Mabini. Quezon, was 
confined in this headquarters for two months, then he was taken to 
a very crowded prison for four months until he was finally released 
with the help of a former professor and church's lawyer. He then 
became more anti-American than ever and vowed that he would 
never be arrested again. He later worked as an overseer of the friar 
estates in Bataan; then as a clerk at the Monte de Piedad in Manila, 
staying with Santiago Antonio's family in Pandacan. 

In the early part of 1903, Quezon passed the bar examinations 
and on April 16, he took his oath as licensed lawyer. Shortly after, 
he found himself employed with Francisco "Paco" Ortigas, Sr., a 
well-known barrister whom the young Quezon became acquainted 
with while at Letran. In 1093, he decided to work as a private 
practitioner. His fame as a young and brilliant lawyer spread far and 
wide in the provinces. He had gained friendship with Governor Paras 
of Tayabas. He was often invited by Col. and Mrs. Bandholtz in their 
house in Lucena. Shortly, Attorney Quezon became the fiscal of 
Mindoro when Civil Governor William H. Taft signed his appoint- 
ment. Six months later, Fiscal Quezon was promoted to a higher 
position in Tayabas due to his vigor and legal ability. He served as 
the register of deeds in addition. Although he was considered the 
best provincial fiscal in the serve"; he decided to resign and continue 
his private law practice. 

In 1905, Quezon ran for governorship in Tayabas and won. In the 
words of Governor General Williams Cameron Forbes,:" . . . Gover- 
nor Manuel Quezon gave good service as governor of the province of 
Tayabas. He also assumed the initiative and used his official position 



beyond the legal powers of a provincial governor in requiring citizens 
to improve their own property by planting great areas of coconut 
and hemp — an extra legal performance which resulted in much 
greater prosperity in that region." 

In July 1907, Quezon resigned from the governorship and filed 
his candidacy for a seat in the First Philippine Assembly, and won 
without campaigning much. In the first Philippine Assembly, Sergio 
Osmena became the Speaker, while Quezon, the majority floor- 
leader. Quezon also handled the committee on appropriations. 

When Congress was planning to introduced free trade relations 
with the Philippines in the Payne-Aldrich and Philippine Tariff Acts 
of 1909, Quezon was one of those who strongly opposed since these 
acts would greatly delay the granting of Philippine Independence, 
but in vain. Few years later, Quezon was sent to the International 
Congress of Navigation held in Petersburg, Russia with two 
secretaries, F. Theo Rogers and Teodoro N. Kalaw. 

At the age of 31, Quezon was appointed Resident Commissioner 
and arrived in Washington, D.C. in 1909. He remained to be one of 
the two resident commissioners to the United States for about 8 
years, which position he held until January 11, 1917. During this 
period two significant political concessions were granted to the 
Philippines: the granting of a Filipino majority in the Philippine 
Commission in 1913, and the surrender of all legislative rights to 
Filipinos with the establishment of the Philippine Senate in 1916. 

On August 29, 1916, President Wilson signed the Jones Law, 
which led the Philippine to enter into a new era — one of greater, 
but still limited autonomy, giving a promise of independence. And 
Manuel L. Quezon was the man responsible for this change. 

At the age of 38, Quezon became the president of the Senate. 

In 1919, Manuel married Aurora Aragon Y Molina, while in 
Hongkong on their way to the United States. Aurora, a very 
beautiful girl, the youngest of the eight children of Pedro Aragon 
and Zenaida Molina, was also from Baler. Later, they lived in the 
United States as a newly married couple. 

While representing his country in various independence mis- 
sions, Quezon fought very hard, believing that he was separating 
himself from his party inorder to effect a new government for the 
Filipinos. Hence, he said, "My loyalty to my party ends where my 
loyalty to my people begins." 

In 1926, Quezon organized the Supreme National Council for 
the purpose of directing Philippine policies concerning the campaign 
for independence, and all matters affecting the relationship between 
US and the Philippines, and the administration of the best interests 
of the country in general. In appealing for independence, Quezon 
expressed in various occasions in the US Congress the urgency for 
giving Filipinos a chance to rule, thus he said" ... I would prefer a 
government run like hell by the Filipinos to one run like heaven by 
Americans. . ." 

After a long political battle during the signing of the Hare- 
Hawes-Hawes-Cutting Law, at last, the Filipino leaders succeeded in 



- — . — 



convincing their co-leaders that the country was not well prepared 
for the immediate granting of independence. In his efforts to 
convince his oppositionists, Quezon acclaimed that the people must 
. . never question a man's patriotism by the blood that runs in his 
veins, or by the nationality of his ancestors; we should judge a man 
by what he is, rather than from where his forefathers came. . ." 
Quezon met a widespread undercurrent of hostility in his efforts to 
serving the people to his side, opposing the immediate granting of 
independence. 

At last, the granting of Philippine independence came into a 
reality with the passage of the Tydings-McDuffie Law. A transition 
period, however, had to be experienced. And so, the Commonwealth 
Government had to be established inorder to better prepare the 
Filipinos for operating their own government. And after an almost a 
year of writing, deliberations and debate, the Constitution was 
finally approved on February 8, 1935. 

In an election held in September 1935, Quezon led over his 
opponents, Emilio Aguinaldo and Gregorio Aglipay by an over- 
whelming majority. Sergio Osmena became his vice president. On 
November 15, Pres. Roosevelt signed a proclamation announcing the 
succession of the Commonwealth government to the then existing 
Philippine government It was on that same day when Pres. Quezon 
and vice Pres. Osmena were inducted into office before Chief Justice 
Ramon Avancena. The commonwealth of the Philippines was also 
inaugurated amidst colorful ceremonies held at the Legislative 
Building, with high government dignitaries attending. 

In his administration, Pres. Quezon championed the cause of the 
poor. He once said that "justice shall be done to the poor and the 
humble in his country as long as I am the President. I am determined 
to fight for the rights of everybody, rich and poor alike, but more 
particularly for those who have no money with which to pay 
handsomely expensive lawyers. And let it be known that I shall use 
the powers of my office to win this fight" Thus, social justice 
became one of the thrusts of his administration. This, he announced 
even before he became the president in his eight guideposts in 
inning the Commonwealth government that "the poor and the 
weak should not be oppressed and the fundamental government 
Policy should not make the poor poorer and the rich richer, but to 
make the poor rich and to provide relief for the needy." He also 
initiated the enrichment of a common language which was rooted 
from theTagalog and which would eventually become the national 
,a nguage. 

In November 1941, in accordance with the amended Constitu- 
tion, the Philippine electorate re-elected Quezon and Osmena to 
the ir positions. 

At the outbreak of the Second World War on December 8, 
19 «1, Quezon, although debilitated by his illness, went around to 
vis 't the bombed areas and raise the morale of its inhabitants. On 
December 24, he held his last cabinet meeting in Marikina where 
the Y decided to leave inorder to preserve the government in 



anticipation of Mac Arthur's decision to declare Manila an open city 
to save it from further destruction. The president and majority of his 
cabinet members left Laurel and Vargas to deal with the Japanese 
and protect the inhabitants from them. The cabinet had to seek 
refuge for two months at Malinta Tunnel in Corrigedor where the 
government was preserved and protected amidst continuous attack. 

President Quezon was a member of the Pacific War Council 
formed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt He was the first Filipino 
who signed the manifesto of the United Nations on June 14, 1942. 

On December 30, Pres. Quezon took his second oath before 
Chief Justice Abad Santos. From Corregidor Island, Pres. Quezon 
was flown to Bachelor Field, a few miles from Port Darwin, aboard 
the bomber, without thinking that this would be the last time to see 
his native land. 

On April 20, 1942 (ten days after the fall of Bataan), Quezon 
and his family moved to San Francisco aboard the s.s. President 
Coolidge. His wartime cabinet continued to function and the 
Commonwealth Government was held in exile and while Manila 
remained in hands of the Japanese for more than three years, with 
Laurel being proclaimed the president of the Republic. 

On July 20, Quezon appointed a new staff to take over the 
rebuilding of a war-torn Philippines, including special studies to 
survey the economic conditions in preparation for its rehabilitation. 

Even on his death bed, El Presidente Quezon (as he was called) 
thought of and worked for his people. His long years of achieve- 
ments and struggle stressed the need for the granting of Philippine 
Independence by the Americans. 

After long years of service to his country, Pres. Quezon died by 
the side of his wife Dona Aurora, and children Maria Aurora (Baby), 
Maria Zenaida (Nini- and Manuel, Jr. (Nonong). He died atSaranac 
Lake without seeing his country being granted independence by the 
United States. His body was deposited at Arlington Cemetery, the 
national cemetery for all American heroes. His body was brought to 
the Philippine aboard U.S.S. Princetone on July 27, 1946 and was 
interred at the Manila North Cemetery. 

So, Manuel Luis Quezon, the first president of the Common- 
wealth of the Philippines is dead - the president, who came from 
the remote village of Baler, and who got popularity due to his plight 
for the poor and due to his political leadership and whose eloquent 
voice echoed at the Philippine Legislature and eventually at the U.S. 
Congress. The idol of many has gone, leaving the famous Code of 
Citizenship and Ethics. 

Manuel Luis Quezon, the promoter of social justice, the father 
of the Philippine national language, and the paladin of Philippine 
freedom has gone. But his memory and vision for an independent 
country have and will always remain in the heart and mind of every 
Filipino. Pres. Manuel Luis Quezon will never be forgotten in the 
history of the Filipino people. 

Our salute to him - President Manuel Luis Quezon - on the 
occasion of his 100th birth anniversary on August 19, 1978.
