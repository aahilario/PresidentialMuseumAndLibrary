MEMORANDUM 


SUBJECT: Presidential Citation Award. 

10 : Major General Valdes, Chief of Staff, Philippine Army. 


1. It is highly recommended that the Philippine Govern- 
ment, as a reward and recognition for the Guerrilla resistance 
on the part of recognized units, be given a Presidential Cita- 
tion carrying with it the authority to wear a ribbon, which will 
distinguish Guerrilla forces from all others. A draft of the 
Presidential Citation is attached herewith. It is recommended 
that this citation cover all members who served at least six 
months as members of recognized Guerrilla units - that is units 
recognized and supported by General MacArthur - between the 
dates of 5 March 1943, the date of recognition of the first 
Guerrilla unit, to 20 October 1944, date of the invasion of Leyte. 
This will cover all of the deserving Guerrilla soldiers and 
officers in Central and Southern Philipoines and a considerable 
number on Luzon. 

2. It is also recommended, in order to make the ribbon 
distinctive, that the colors run lengthwise instead of crosswise 
on the bar; and that the colors be blue, white and red, which 
are the colors of both the Philippine and American flags. Sug- 
gested design is also attached. 

3. This should be recommended as a Presidential Citation 
since the Philippine Liberation Ribbon will take care of the 
'â€¢campaign" aspect of the situation. What I think would be de- 
sirable, would be a special ribbon or recognition separate of 
the campaign ribbons, so that Guerrillas will have something 
unobtainable by other units, and a citation in the form of a 
ribbon which would not be available to anyone else. It would 
definitely be a citation proud to possess and wear and it is 
not too much to ask for the lads who have done such a good job.
