He cried Wolf, They Thought 

PC Boss Alberto Ramos had 
been taking Nueva Ecija Gov. 
Juan O. Chioco’s importunations 
for constabulai’y reinforcements to 
his Huk^plagued province like the 
stor^^-book child’s cries of “wolf.” 
Nobody listened to Chioco, not ’ 
even the President. 

Last week, they realized the j 
wolf was real. Mrs. Aurora Ara- j 
gon.Vda. de Quezon, heading a 
long motorcade made up of top- I 
bracket government officials and j 
prominent members of the com- , 
munity on the way to Baler to : 
lay the cornerstone of the marker 
honoring her late husbands ran 
smack into a well-laid ‘ambush, 
some three kilometers from Ba- 
ler. The ambuscade claimed a 
death toll that reads like a “Who’s 
"^who.” ) 

Dead were Mrs. Quezon, daugli- 
ter Maria Aurora (Baby) Quezon, ; 
son-in-law Philip Buencamino III, 
Quezon City Mayor Ponciano Ber- 
nardo, Maj. Primitive San Agus- 
tin, Jr., lit. Col. Antonio San 
Agustin, Lt. Joaquin Lasam, Lt. 
Juan Molina, Lt. D. Marabejo, 
Cpl. Brigido Valdez and Pedro j 
Payamo. Quezon family cook. ! 
Among the wounded was retired ( 
Maj. Gen. Rafael Jalandoni. 

The tragedy shook the nation ; 
and many parts of the world. 
After the shock wore off, the ac- 
counting for whom to blame 
cropped up. That the ambushers 
were given the opportunity to 
stage the mass-killing aftej; and 
in spite of Chioco’s alarums drew 
attention immediately to the neg- 
ligence of the Constabulary- ; 

At week’s enc? i 

PC troops were still hide- ; 

and^seek. !

.'V« 










H ardly two weeks after President Quuino an- 
noimced that peace and order had been restor- 
ed— an “achievement” of bis administration, Mrs. 
Aurora Aragon de Quezon, her da«g»\ter her son-m- 
law and nine others were massacred m the most 
shocking tragedy the Philippines has eiqjerienced. 
The ambuscade, all the more barbarous because of 
the dignity and innocence of its victims, was-nevei- 
IhLsf only one of a series of recent daring, succes- 
sive and similar raid hy Huk bands on civilian trave- 
lers. It is only too evident, and increasingly so, that 
there is no peace and certainly no order. 

Editorial writers, national leaders, government of- 
ficials and even the little man on the street have laid 
the blame squarely at the door of the administration. 
And in the very last analysis one can reach under the 
circumstances, after all the emoting, the reproaches 
and regrets, the if-only’s and the what-might-have- 
been’s— after all that, it remains that the govern- 
ment has failed, and with what revolting consequent 



A, 


ces, in giving the Filipino citizens what their coil- 
^titution raarantees: protection to life and property. ^ 

It to(dc the death of the Quezons and their com-| 
panions in death to jolt the government, and the na-| 
tion with it, out of its egotistic politicking, out of jB 
its smug and blind complacency, out of its hay-mak-g 
iiig escapism, out of its cowardly refusal to recognize.! 
that the Huks are still here, stronger if anything. Ini 
spite of amnesty, all-out campaign, firm assurance | 
from general and department secretary and 
ident, it has become painfully apparent everything im 
not all right, that the demon of Huklandia will notv 
he exorcised by the incantation that “all is quiet,” ^ 
nor appeased b> ineffectual government crop loansi ; 
seedlings and irrigation systems nor annihilated by 
PC and AFP homhardments. 

Neither is it enough for the administration to 
claim now shamefacedly, in the face of such terrible/ 
proof of failure, that it has done its best. But has : i 
Or if it has, isn’t it undeniable that its best is 
from being good enough? 







I Plea For Peace Among Last 

I Acts Of Mrs* Quezon 

1 • ' 

I A lest testement of the great lady who suffered death from 

I the hands of the ones for whom she and her husband labored. 


A n Appeal for “peace, charity and good 
will, as well as respect for the 
law, amongst our own beloved people/’ 
was made by Mrs, Aurora Aragon de 
Quezon only a few days before she was 
ambushed and killed by Huks. 

The plea, which was her last, was 
directed to the Catholic world. It found ’ 
ready response from local leading Ca- 
tholics and prominent citizens but failed 
to penetrate passion-swept, blood-crazed 
Ruklandia. She fell victim to this latest 
of Huk outrages, killed by her “own 
beloved people”, whom her husband, the 
late Prcsidetil Manuel Quezon had serv- 
ed SO' well when he w'as living. 

Mrs. Quezon’s appeal and those who 
responded to it follows: 

The undersigned Catholics, mostly re- 
sidents ill the Archdiocese of Manila, 
with the object of having special devo- 
tions, prayers, and sacrifices offered 
by our brethren during the month of 
May, in honor of our Blessed Mother 
Mary, Mediatrix of All Graces, to im- 
plore her powerful intercession for the 
protection of our holy religion, which is 
being so cruelly persecuted in many 
countries at the present time; to beseech 
through her powerful intercession world 
peace, which is threatened at the present 
time by another devastating war; and 
finally 'and very specially, to obtain 
peace and charity and good will, amongst 
our own beloved people in the Philip- 
pine Islands. 

“Encouraged by our kind reception, 
during which the Archbishop, speaking 
for his own Archdiocese, promised to 
moperate. we now approach each and 
all of the members of the Hierarchy witli 
a similar petition, promising that in all 
things the wishes of the Ordinary in 
each ecclesiastical jurisdiction will be 
• promptly and exactly obeyed. During 
this coming month of May we suggest a 
special celebration in honor of Our Lady 
Mediatrix of all Graces which will oc- 
cur on the 31st of May. We believe that 
a national novena beginning on Sunday, 
May 22nd, and ending on Monday, May 


30th, to be crowned by a great general^ 
communion all over the Islands on May 
31st, the feast of our Lady as Mediatrix 
of ail graces, would make a most power- 
ful appeal to Almighty God, especiMly 
when offered by a whole nation in ho- 
nor of the Queen of Heaven. 

“Of course, in all these things, we 
must follow the le^d of Your Excellen- 
cies and be obedient to whatever condi- 
tions may be imposed in your diocese, 
but, may we beg the Archbishops, Bis- 
hops and Prefects Apostolic of the Phil- 
ippine Hierarch 3 ^ to initiate a movement 
in ^our respective diocese for special de- 
votions and daily mortifications during 
this coming month of May. May we go 
further and ask for, first, the family 
rosary in all Catholic homes; second, 
mortifications, sacrifices, visits to the 
Most Blessed Sacrament and Stations 
of the Cross, to be offered according to 
the devotion and convenience of our 
brethren ; and third, perhaps pilgrimages 
to the different shrines of Our Lady, 
such as Antipolo, Pehafrancia, and Ma- 
nawag, etc., etc. 

“We offer our filial obedience and 
cooperation to the Hierarchy for the ful- 
fillment of such a program, in case it 
should be approved, for a May dedicated 
solemnly to Our Lady with prayers and 
mortifications for the safety of the 
Church and its Supreme Pontiff, as well 
as for peace in the whole world, and 
especially in our own land.”

CATHOLICS BELiEVE: 

That the Philippines has received and is receiving from

That the Blessed Virgin Mary is inviting the whole world 
to a life of prayer and penance, so that peace throughout the 
world may be truly attained. 

THEREFORE, WE CATHOLICS MUST ACT: 

By joining every day during the month of May t}ie Ra- 
dio Family Rosary that will be broadcast over Station DZPI 
from 6:15 to 6:30 a. m. 

By performing daily acts of mortification and penance; 

By attending the novena in honor of the Blessed Virgin 
Mary in our respective parish churches from Sunday, May 
22 to Monday, May 30; ' ‘ 

By receiving the Blessed Sacrament on May 31st, the 
Feast of Our Lhdy Mediatrix of all Graces, and by partici- 
pating on that day in the diocesan consecration to Our Lady; 

By going on a Pilgrimage to one of the shrines of the 
Blessed Virgin Mary; 

By making every day of our lives more selfless, more 
sympathetic to those less fortunate, and more in conformity 
with the ways of true Christianity.

MANILA, PHILIPPINES, THURSDAY, MAY 5, 1949 


iJalandoni Gives 
.PC Escort Version 

_ Maj. Gen. Rafael Jalandoni, re- 
tired chief of staff* AFP, last night 
said he had nothing to do with the 
PC escort accompanying the Que- 
zon party a week ago in which 
Mrs. Quezon and 11 other mem- 
bers of her party were massacred 
by dissidents in Bongabon. 

In giving the statement he was 
aiming at refuting statement at- 
tributed to Lt. Col. Macario Asis- 
tio, PC G-2 officer, allegedly blam- 
ing Jalandoni for the Quezon kill- 
ing. The PC officer testifed Tites- 
day before the house committee 
on appropriations. 

The officer in charge of tlie es- 
cort group in the Quezon party, 
Gen. Jalandoni averred, was Maj. 
Pedro Alcantara, a PC officer and 
a nephew of Mrs. Quezon. Instruc- 
tions^ on escort duties were direct- 
ly transmitted- to Maj. Alcantara 
by. the PC command, Jalandoni 
said. 

Jalandoni' said he joined the 
Quezon party as a “guest” and hs^d 
nothing to do with official secu- 
rity extended by the PC to 'the 
, Quezon part 3 ^ 

j The retired AFP chief of staff | 

I added had the PC combed the : - 
area earlier previous to the pas- 1 
sage of the Quezon party on the! 
Bongabon road, the constabulary I 
would have known about the Huk' 
detention of people 'who passed by 
the same place earlier in the morn- 
ing of the ambush. 

Jalandoni said he had given the 
facts of the incident before the 
cabinet. General Ramos, PC chief, 
he said, was in complete agree- 
ment. 



fioipDUhhi 


Callers keep on ppuring at the 
Quezon home on Gilmore Avenue 
and there Is hardly a minute that 
.\lnl Q. Biiencaiiiino and Noiiong 
are without visitors to condole with 
them or keep them company, as 
the case may he. In fact, some 
.very clo.se family friends have de-l 
ciderl to ^stay for Che duration of I 
the May rtovena... Dona Jesii.sa! 
Arroyo and Nena Fabella Paiiiin - 1 
tiian, to mention a few. Dona Con-j 
snclo Ciiyiigan, on one hand, com-' 
mutes every dav between her home , 
in Baclaran 3nd Gilmore... she 
spends the whole day till after the 
novena in the evening at the latter. 
The J(»e Yulos make it a point to 
attend the evening prayers and so 
I does the younger set of friends of | 
Nini which includes Unding Alu- 
nan, Chito Madrigal, Gin Mata,! 

Rnby Roxas, etc Previous nove- 

nas have been held upstairs in the 
living room but now that the shock . 
and confusion as a result ‘of the tooj 
sudden, too stunning news has ! 
more or less subsided and the cha-| 
pel of the late beloved Dona An-i 
rora downstairs on the first floor' 
has been tidied up, the devout con- 1 
gregation of friends and relatives 
will assemble there from then on! 
In the evenings. | 

Passing an eye over the altar, one ; 
can not help but notice three pic- 
tures of the miraculous Lady of 
Mediatrix accommodated in there 
• . . they were all gifts to the grand 
lady, we understand. Dona Aurora 
was one big-hearted lady who ap- 
preciated every single little gift 
given her and that she showed by 
finding somehow, somewhere a 
place for it in her home. The 
altar is as good a portion of her 
bedroom, or the other way around 
... at any rate, the two follow a 
room scheme of one broad sweep 
of space with a very light parti- 
tion between. 

From the altar, one goes into the 
' living room which Is simply fumr 
ished with rattan furniture. Here, 
one notes as if nothing had hap- 
i pened, as if it was any^ ordinary 
day d.iring the life of Dona Aurora 
when shoes of Bongbong... that’s 
how Nini’s boy — Philip Iv — is in- 
variably called... would just be 
splattered all over, on the sofa, (m 
the rug — every where else. Dona 
Aurora was so much attached toi 
this first grandchild whom she 
wanted so much to stay with her 
for the most part of the day on 
the ground floor, and no rug was i 
too costly to be soiled by him... 
this grandson first before any con- 
sideration for any exacting *%ome 
beautiful” thought. 

One notices, too, in the sala a 
picture of the late President Quezon 
! that must have been given many 
Years ago to Phil III, Here is the 
dedication on it; “To Phil Buenca-I 
! mlno Jrd — With my best wishes for | 

' a successful career and in recognl- j 
tion of a brilliant beginning.” A. 

' huge oil portrait of Nini and Baby 
in Filipina dress hangs on one wall. 
Other pictures that occupy choice 
{places in the livingroom, on the 
’ piano and on side tables are those 
of Frank Murphy, Mrs. FJ^anor 
Roosevelt, and the late Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt— all with declica- , 
tions showing intimate and close I 
friendship with the Quezons. ! 
I There is not yet a very definite' 
plan for disposal of the things of 
’Baby Quezon, although it Is one 
I thing sure that all will go to the ; 

1 poor. . . one gesture which Nini he* | 
ilieves would be in accordance wiih', 
the devotion that Baby had kept for { 
! the poor. The things may he given: 
' through some charitable institu*; 
I fnns. sav the leper colony, or some. 
o;her...‘ Nini hasn’t made up her 
mind through which. ^

news of the 

Coh.^ o°n th^r reached 

i 'i ®** evening of tha day 
of the ambuscade. With a mix- 
ed feeling of anger, and grief, 
citizens of the city and nrovinca 
condemned the ambush as the 
worst crime that the ambushers 
had committed. 

Upon being- told of the news, 
px-Pvesident Osmeha in his 
statement said, **I am shocked by 
the tragedy that has befallen 
Mrs. Quezon, -her children and 
friends. I join the nation in 
mourning their untimely pass- 
ing.” 

tiovernor Manuel Cuenco de- 
clared that the assailants of 
Mrs. Quezon should be made to 
pay for their atrocious acts. The 
governor wired his condolence to 
Mrs. Zienaida Quezon Buencami- 
no ^‘for the untimely death of 
Doha Aurora, Baby and Philip.” 

Tn his message of condolence 
to Mrs. Buencamino, Mayor Mi- 
guel Raffihan said that “the 
manner of their untimely end has 
deeply shocked and angered the 
Cebuano people who cherish the 
memory of yoiir father and mo- 
ther as well as the members of 
your immediate family with ut- 
most respect and reverence.” 

Municipal Board President 
Floreiicio Urot in his statement 
declared that the violent death

•The Philippine constabulary and 
Quezon City police adopted secu- 
rity measures upon receipt of re- 
ports that the surviving members 
of the Quezon family were, being 
threatened with harm by “un- 
known elements.” 

Reports on the threats were re-

Dr. Luis Alandy, a friend of the 
Quezon family and survivor of the 
Huk ambuscade on the Bongabon- 
Baler road which claimed the lives 
of Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon, her 
daughter Baby, her son-in-law 
Philip Buencamino III and nine 
others.

guard the life and security of peo- 
ple residing in the Quezon home

Rites Set May 9 
For Mrs. Quezon 




Early this morning the p-hone 
rang, and at lb© other end of 
the wire was Mrs. Koinuio 
telling us the shocking news of 
Doha Aurora’s death. The re- 
port has been coming in over 
the radio every half-hour and 
we have been receiving calks 
from friends of the Qnezons 
who wanted tc check up with 
Embassy people about the vc- 
: racity of the report. Being 
j this far away from home it is 
I really rather hard not to know 
i what really happened. The 
I first news broadcasts mentioned 
j Doha .Aurora, her daughter 
Maria Aurora, Mayor Bernardo 
and ten others were killed. 


I had an me ladies clapping for 
Then another report mention- 
ed Doha Aurora, her daughter 
and her son-in-law were killed, 
and the teletype in the office 
mentioned Doha Aurora, her 
daughter and her grandson. It 
was all very confusing, but so^ 
very tragic At last this nodh 
we got an official cable from 
Manila to the Embassy saying 
definitely it was Doha Aurora, 
Baby, and Philip who had died 
in the ambush. The Embassy 
was ordered closed for the rest 
of the day by the Ambassador, 
as a sign of respect and mohrn- 
ing. Filipino priests at Wood- 
stock College MayJand have 
offered to say reipiiem masses. 
Oiir deepest sympathies go to 
Nini, and the Biiencaminos.

Quezon Ambuscade Stirs Washington, Report; 
May Influence hS To Give Arms Aid To PI 


j. By JAMES CUNNINGHAM 

WASHINGTON. May 4 (UP). — Military observers speculated that 
I arms aid to the Philippines would stand or fall largely according to 
j whether congress approves or reduces the proposed $1,450,000,000 ap- 
propriation to help foreign nations forj;.ify themselves against com- 
munism 

These observers guessed that the Philippines might hope to get 
up to $30,000,000 in military supplies if congress passes tlie arms 
bill unaltered but less if it economizes. But they expressed the opi- 
nion that the matter would further depend to some extent on the 
relative degree of the communist threat to the Philippines as com- 
pared wih other countries eligible for aid. 

Senate Foreign Committee 


Chairman Tom Connally of Te- 
xas said recently that the island 
republic was among the countries 
qualified to share the $320,000,- 
000 arms aid proposed for non- 
Atlantic pact nations. He said 
these eligibles included Greece, 
Turkey, Iran, Korea, the Philip- 
pines and others. 


Observers believed that conti- 
nuation of the present Greek-Tur- 
kish aid program would absorb the 
bulk of this $320,000,000. 


They further speculated that 
congress might divide the remain- 
der on the basis of whether Iran, 
for example, or Korea or the Phil- 
ippines appeared most currently 
pressed by communists either 
within or along its r borders. 


Some sources carried the idea 
one step further. They suggest- 
ed that Mrs. Aurora Quezon^s 
assassination might start con- 
gress thinking that the Hukba- 
lahap mo%'ement continues as a 
real communist thread to Philip- 
pine stability and security. 


Congressional quarters pointed 
out that the Quezon tragedy stir- 
red more comment from Capitol 
Hill than any Philippine event 
since the death of President Ma- 
nuel Roxas a year ago. And 
some congressmen like Karl Ste- 
fan of Nebraska and Pat Kear- 
ney of New York, indicated that 
they would support the idea of 
giving the Philippine govern- 
ment tools to wipe out what they 
called communist-led Huk dissi- 
dents. 


democracy in the Far East. 

Philippine circles believed that 
any United States aid to the is- 
land republic w^ould take the form, 
firstly, of unused supplies stored 
away in United States depots after 
the war; and, secondly, service- 
able equipment made surplus by 
the current demobilization of the 
Philippine scouts. 


Stefan told the United Press 
that he believed there was enough 
sentiment in the house to carry 
such measure. He said that he 
felt it should be part of the gen- 
eral foreign arms aid program 
rather than separate legislation. 


Other observers expected the 
red sweep toward South China to 
bring home to congi*ess the island 
republic’s strategic position facing 
communist Asia'. They said that 
the farther south reds move in 
China, the more prominently the 
Philippines looms as a citadel of 


OurGreatestTeacher 


These words and this our deep 
grief are hopelessly futile and 
inadequate to express the great 
loss that we have suffered from 
Doha Aurora’s tragic death. 
She was our ideal Filipina 
mother, the personification of- 
everything that Was sublime 
and noble in- Filipino woman- 
hood. Her devotion to her fa- 
mily, her solicitude over the 
poor, her indefatigable efforts 
at social amelioration, her 
exemplary self-effacement, the 
soothing influence of her ra- 
diant and pleasing personal- 
ity. — all of these qualities will 
forever enshrine her in our 
hearts. The death of Mrs. Que- 
zon and Baby- Quezon completes 
the martyrdom of the Quezons 
for the cause of the masses. It 
is for us the living to emulate 
Doha Aurora’s glorious exam- 
ple, for her life truly made her 
the greatest teacher of us all!

Quirino To Speak At Quezon Rites 


President Quirino will deliver 
tlie principal eulogy in the necro- 
logical ceremonies honoring Mrs. 
Aurora A. Quezon, departed Red 
Cross chairman, at 8 to* 9 p.m., 
Monday, May 9, at the Malacahan 
. social hall. At Monday’s rites, 
sponsored by the PNRC board of 
governors. Dr. Manuel Lim, acting 
PNRC chairman, and Mrs. Tri- 
nidad F. Legarda, president of the 
National Federation of Women’s 
Club, will also speak. 

president Quirino, when inform- 
ed in Baguio through long dis- 
tance telephone by Dr. Manuel 
Lim last Tuesday evening of the 
proposed rites, said that he would 
only be too glaki to take time from 
the pressing affairs of state to de- 
liver the principal tribute to Mrs. 


Quezon. 

Mrs. Quezon, on September 27, 
1946, was chairman* of the Central 
Executive .committee, then the 
governing body of the Philippine 
Rod Cross when still under the 
American Red Cross. She took 
the place of Gren. Basilio J. Val- 
des who resign^. 

On April 21. 1947, six days after 
the Philippine National Red Cross 
was declared an independent Na- 
tional Red Cross society, Mrs. Que- 
zon was elected chairman by the 
board of governors. Since then, 
the widow of the late President 
Manuel Quezon devoted her full 
time and effort to Red Cross work 
and was commended by other Red 
Cross societies for the strides the 
organization has made. 


Hawaiian' Orchids 
Placed On Quezon Tombs 

The Polynesian orchids rushed 
to Manila from Honolulu by PAL 
-plane from the Filipinos in Ha- 
waii for Mrs. Aurora Quezon, Ma- 
ria Aurora Quezon and Philip 
Buencamino III, were placed yes- 
terday on their graves by a ladies 
committee of the department of 
foreign affairs designated by Un- 
dersecretary Felino Neri. 

TLie flowers, choice cattleyas of 
the Hawaiian islands, purchased 
from voluntaiy contributions of 
countrymen and the Philippine 
consulate general staff in Hono- 
lulu, reached Manila Tuesday j 
night, and were taken the next | 
morning to the Quezon mausoleum 
at the North cemetery by Mrs. 
Rafaelita H. Soriano, Misses Fe 
Palma and Julia Palarca. 


Dedicate May As Month 
Of Prayer, Catholics Urge 


Prominent Catholics of the | 
Philippines, in appeals addressed 
to the Christian world, have dedi- 
cated the month of May as a 
month of prayer. 


The prayer, which was signed | 
by a group headed by the late Mrs. : 
Aurora A. Quezon, Chief Justice 
Manuel V. Moran, Senate Presi- 
dent Jesus Mariano Cuenco, Dr. 
Salvador Araneta, and many oth- 
ers, asks that “special devotions, 
prayers, and sacrifices be offered 
^ by all our brethren during the 
j month of May, in honor of our 
Blessed. Mother Mai*y, Mediatrix 
of all Graces, to implore her po- 
werful intercession for the pro- 
tection of our holy religion, which 
is being cruelly persecuted in 
many countries at the present 
time; to beseech through her po- 
werful intercession world peace, 
which is ^ threatened at the pre- 
’ sent time^ by another devastating 
war; and finally and very special- 
ly, to obtain peace and charity 
and good will, as well as precent 
for the law’’ in the Philippines. 

The “spiritual testament” was 
one of the last acts of Mrs. .Que- 
zon. 


Dr. Salvador Araneta, in indors- 
ing the month of -May as a month 
of prayer, said: 


“Now that she has become the 
pure and innocent victim of our 
fratricidal hatreds, this appeal of 
Dona Aurora for a month of May 
dedicated to prayers and penan- 
ces, acquire a very significant 
meaning. More than ever, we 
must realize that in the Philip- 
pines, we are facing a great na- 
tional crisis and that prayers and 
penances must take more of our 
life, if our country has to be 
saved.” 

Pilgrimages to the different 
shrines of Our Lady, such as Anti- !

that among the rtis^Mems who 
have retreated to the jagged moun- 
tain peak probably for a last-ditch 
stand, were those who took part in 
the infamous ambush of the Que- 
zon party in Bongahnn a week ago. ; 

PC artillery continues shelling i 
the heights of the mountain. Smell ■ 
of decayed flesh pervades thej 
slopes of the mountain indicating! 
considerable Huk casualties from; 
the heavy barrar^e of guns. i 

For the pasi few days, state 
troops took time to dispose of the 
bodies of slain dissidents, but the 1 
process has to be suspended tem- 
porarily .since the start of intensi- 
fied operations in the vicinity ofj 
the mountain. 

Around 150 buri hats popularly; 
knorvvn as “sahutan,” of Baler ori- 
gin, were captured by advance PC 
patrols. It is believed the hats 
were those worn by Quezon am- 
bushers. A number of similar hats 
were found two days ago near Dig- 
mala following a clash. 

Huk morale is .reported to have 
been considerably weakened in the 
face of continuous shelling from 
government battery units "D” and 
“C'\ 

Battle-seasoned troops of the 1st 
Hea\w Weapons Company, the 12th, 
and the 9th PC companies, and Col. 
Valeriano’s famed 1st PC Combat

ment are fast closing in on the en- 
trenched Huk strongpoint * while

May^r Jovino Tienzo of Lupao 
this morning told the Times his 
town has been alerted simce yes- 
terday afternoon against a possi- 
ble Huk attack from the direction 
of the northern hills. The alarm 
was sounded following intelligence 
reports that a large Huk band most-

invaders, will be shocked at the 
brutal slaying of his widow, his 
daughter and his son-in-law in the 
mountains north of Manila. The 
tragedy seems so wanton and 
pointless, whatever the motives of 
the killers; as a political act of 
the communist-led hukhalahaps, 
as is now charged, it can only 
intensify the determination of the 
government to suppress the move- 
ment which caused the crime. 

Mrs. Aurora Quezon has been 
active in many fields of endeavor, 1 
and her charitable work, her ef- j 
forts on behalf of the women of j 
her country, have her many claims ! 
upon the gratitude and affection ' 
of the Filipinos. The great crowd 
of mourners which gathered for 
her funeral procession was an elo- 
quent testimony to her position in 
the hearts of her people, just as 
the night-long battle with her kill- 


ers- told the reality of the danger 
which her assassination repre- 
sented. The United States will 
share in the sorrow of the Philip- 
pines, and hope that the young re- 
public will soon be able to stamp 
out the forces which threaten it.

The children remained kneeling! 
for a long time under the influence I 
perhap.s of some supernatural state j 
of ecslacy or suspen.sion of bodily: 
powers, .such a.s many .saints have' 
de.scribed. ‘Mt was .so intcn.se,”! 
wrote Lucia, “that Ave Avere almo.st 
unaware of our own existence for! 
a long .space of time.” They kept' 
saying the Angel’s prayer over and! 
over. Not that there Avas any dan- 
ger of forgetting it, for the words 
had lieen impressed Indelibly upon i 
their mind.s; but it .seemed the only 
Ihing to do. ! 

‘‘My God, I belieye, I adore, 1!

All of them, in fact, felt Aveak and i

selves together 'and ihen began to 
collect the scattered sheep, for the 
day Avaa far spent and it Avas near- 
ly time for sup])er. None of them 
Iclt Idee talking on the wav to 
Aljusirrl. 

.lu.-(L before they parted, kucia 
warned the others to sav nothin" 
of what they had seen and heanf. 
Why she did this she doe.s not know’ 
even to 111 is day. “it seemed tlie 
right thing to do” she told nu*. 
“There was somerhi ng infcmselv in-

Whether it, Avas splendid Michael 
that the children saw' at Gabeco. or

weeks after the first. It w’a.s one

'riicy had tak.-n their -s'hecp home 
at noon to inclose them during the 
bJazing hours of the siesta, and 
were spending the time playing lis- 
temn.g at the well in the .^hacle of 
the fig trees behind the Ahobora 
cottage, apparently wifh no thought 
of what was about to liappen 
when they looked up and saw hiin 
there beside them. 

What are you doing? he demand- 
ed. “Pray! f»ray a great deal! The 
hearts of .Jesus and of Marv have 
merciful designs for yon.‘ Offer 
prayers and sacrifices constant !v to 
tlie Mo.st High.” 

“How must ue sacrifice?” a^k^d 
r.ucia. 


“With all your power offer a 
.sacrilice as an act of i-eparalion for 
the .sinnoj-s by whom He is offend- 
ed. and of siqiplication for the con- 
version of sinners. Thus draw^ 
peace upon your country. I am its . 
Guardian Angel, the Angel of Por- ] 
tugal. Above all accept and endure 
with submission llie suffering

He was gone. And again Hie 
children remained for a long time 
in a .sort of ec.siacy or exultation 
of spirit, adoi’ing Hie Lord God 
, w^hose messenger had been revealed 
j lo them. When this gradually fell 
.away and they began to feel more 
like their oi-dinary selves, Lucia 
discovered that Francisco had 
Ilea rd nol.hing of what Hie Angel 
liad said, although, as before, ho 
I liad seen him plainly. 

“Oid you speak Avith the Angel*;”! 
he asked. ‘‘What did he .say to' 
you?” ‘ I 

‘‘Oidn’t .you hear?” | 

“:Vo. 1 saw that you were speak- i 
ing w'ith somchfKiy. 1 heard Avhat' 
you said to' hl.in, lait T don’t know 
w'hat lie said.” 

'I’he n-o.xt day Francisco said lo 
lii.s sister: 

“Jacinta, tell me*Avhal the Angel 
•said.” 

“I’ll tell you tomoiTOAA’,” said the' 
little girl. “Today 1 can’t speak.”! 

On the following day he .sought 
out l.ucia again and .said: I 

“Hid you sleep la.st night? ij 


was thinking all the time of the 
Angel and Avhat it might be he 
said.” 

She then repeated the Angel’s 
Avords on both occasions. ’Phe bov’s ! 
mind Avas .slower thain Jacinta’s. I 
He had difficulty gra.sning Avhat ’ 
.some of it meant. 

“Who is the Most High?” he ask- 
ed. “What does it mean, “The' 
hearts of .lesiis and Mary are at- 
tentive t(A the voice of A'our suppli- 
cations?” 

iaicla tried to explain. It Avas 
not wisy. for he would break in 
constantly Avilh other questions. 
Besides, the Avelght of Avhat she 
calls “the asmosphere of the super- 
natural” was still to .sonie extent 
upon (hem boHi. oven after so Jong 
a time. She could not think of 
what to say. Finallv he .said. “Some 
other day! A.sk me some other 
day!” 

lie Availed patiently, but at the 
first bpportimity he began plvlng 
ker Avith new^ questions. 

“Don’t talk much about Hicse 
f.hlngs!” Jnierrupted .lacinta. Vet 
with charming inconsistenev .she 
went on to say that there Avas 
something about Hie Angel that 
made her no longer \Aant to talk- 


sing or play. “I haven’t strength 
enough for anything.” ® 

“Neither have I ” said Francisco. 
But AVhat ot jt? The Angel i.s 
most beautiful than all this. Let 
us think about him!” 

• PresenWy lie din begin to graso 
what the Angel had meant by sa^. 
orifices. From ihai day forth he 
vied with the girls in giving up 
ttle pleasiire.s and .sati.sfacUons fo? 
the sinner.s of the world. All three 
would .spend hours at a time Iv ne 
prostrate on the ground, repe/tlne 
over and over the prayer lhat thf I 
Anpl had taught. , 

This must have Iteen in .Julv or ' 
August, 1910. As nearlv a« Lucia' 
can esiimato, it was prohahiv late’ 
Septemiier or October « hen he fn i 
reared for the third and last time I 
•Again they had been plajing in the ' 
■■cave' at Caheco, while the sheep' 
.strayed o,i the .slo(,e below; and 
after saying their Rosarv as usual 
they were reciting the praver 
unison: ' -

j “My God, I belie\'f.‘, 

I hope.^and I love You. . 

I of You for (hose who do not helicvc 
1 do not adore, do not hope, *md do ' 
not Jove You.” ' 

They had said thi.s hiii a , 
times when they saw the same erv- ‘ 
stalllne light come SAviftly over the 
' valley, and there he w-as,‘ beautiful, ‘ 
resplendent, dazzling, lovering in 
■the air before them. This time he 
held in one hand a Chalic^, and in 
the other, over it, a Ho.st. These 
he left su.'jpended In the air Avhile 
he prostrated himself on the ground 
and said; 

'Mo.st Holy Trinity, Father. Son,; 
Holy Spirit, T adore You profound- i 
ly and offer You the most preciou.s 
Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of 
Jesus Christ, present in all the ta- 
bernacles of the earth, in prepara- 
tion. for the outrages, sacrileges, and 
indifference with Avhich He Hlm- 
i self is offered. And through the 
infinite merits of His Most Sacred 
Heart and of the Immaculate Pleart 
of Mary, I beg of You t'he conver- 
Sion of poor sinners.’ 

This he said three limes. Then 
; rising up, he took the Chalice and' 
Mhe l-lQ.st, and kneeling on the flat ' 
rock, held the AA^hite disk before* 
him, sayln.g: 

‘Take and drink the Body and 
t'he Blood of Jesus Christ, horribly 
insulted by ungrateful men. Make I 
reparation for their crimes and !‘ 
con.sole your God.' | 

They could see drops of Blood 
falling from the Host into the Cup. 

He placed It on the tongue of Lu- 
cia. To Jacinta and Francisca, Avho 
had not received First Commivnaon

I am th€ Lady of tht Rosary 
Men must amend their lives

They must hot continue to offend

rosary everyday 

MESSAGE OF OUR LADY OF FATIMA 


It has never been more timely, 
more fitting, to have the family 
rosary recited in every home than 
in this month of May We urge 
all not to fail to say this wonderful 
prayer every day in honor of Our 
Blessed Mother, Our Lady Me- 
diatrix of All Graces, to whom 
we are dedicating our prayers, 
our devotions, our sacrifices du- 
ring this month of May 


LAYM-EN'S COMMITTEE, AAAY DEVOTIONS

Unlveittily of Sfo. Tomas 
’(The Caiholic University of the Philippines) 








ONLY PRAYERS. PENANCES. AND A NEW WAY OF LIFE CAN SAVE THE WORLD! 


When Felipe Bueneamino had been shot, end lay dyinf, he wrote on the 
windshield of the car, in his own blood : "Hope-God." He said the rosary all the 
way to the hospital, and his last request was for a priest. 


Felipe died well. 


Most of us die well. Whenever there is a call for heroic action, we respond. 
We ore not afraid of danger or of death. We proved that during the war. We 
die like men, courageously, calmly, praying to the Virgin and to her Son. 


When we see a danger, we face it. But there is one danger which we nei^er 
face nor fight, which some of us don't see, end some of us try to ignore. The 
danger of a godless Philippines-a communistic Philippines and a eommunistis 

world! 


How to prevent it? 


With proyers, penances and a new way of life-a new way of life richer in 
spiritual and material benefits for the great masses of the people. 


The Blessed Virgin, in her oppeara nces, which are a special gift to us, says 
thot we should fight! She wants justice, prayer and penance. She wants it 
now, while we are living. She is not coivtent that we should be heroic when we 
die. If we are brave in war, why not now? Why should we not live as beautifully 

as we die? 


If in the heat and dust of the day we were as honest, os selfless, as cou^ 

ageous,asnobleasweareatdeath-ifwe prayed now as we P'’®^ 
would change the face of the Philippines. We would prevent the 
World War III. We would end the current civil strife which caused the death 
of Felipe. We would be men, worthy of the Virgin, worthy of the nation.

Aiul-----Cotholie Alumni — If anyone is to answer this request of the Virgin/ 
it must be we. If we don^t answer, no one will.

for May Devotions by the Child of Mar>* from Sta. Thei'esa’s College 
in connection with the implementation of the nation-wide campaign for 
peace through the Blessed Virgin and Christ the Lord. 

According to the letter addressed | ‘ it is for this very reason that 

to the committee, the Sta. Theresa’s I I ''. rde .vou as one of the many 
College Child of Mary proposed the Cattiohcs who I hope, will not turn

2. The message of Out*. Lady of 
Fatima and Our Lady :Medlatfl^ 6f 
all Grace (is expressed in the 
circular notice of thi Lipa appari- 
tions) is the same. It is threefold, 
namely, Prayer, Penance, and indi- 
vidual or family conseci'atidh. to 
the Immaculate Heart of Maty. 
With regard to periance — I would 
make this suggestion. Portugal wa^ 
saved from revolutionary elements 
because her Catholics heeded the 
call for penance and abstinence 
from dances, movies, immod^t 
dresses and every pleasure and ; 
amusement that would endanger ; 
the morals of our youth. How about |

phlets. 

The letter follow^ in full: 

"First of ail, I wish to express 
my best congi’atulations to those 
who were responsible in launching 
a drive for peace. Indeed, we are 
m gi'eat need of such efforts as an 
all out spiritual drive for peace 
and your appeal which appeared in 
the Manila Chronicle calling all 
Catholics to a crusade of prayer 
and penance was most welcome in- 
deed. We Catholics ar^ called upon 
to respond, heart and soul to that 
call becau.se our Lady’s appeal 
from Fa Tima has grown very ur- 
gent in view of the present chaos 
in a vorld that, seems to go far- 
, ther and farther away from Christ 
\ and His Divine teachings. We 
1 know even that such an appeal has 


ing: 

"1. For the radio family rosar\’ 
—how about mentioning this imten-i 
tlon before recitation among other 
intentions, “For the conversion of 
Russia” this being the express wish 
of the Holy Father. To explain this 
most important intention, you per- 
haps laiiow that in our Lady’s ap- 
peal at Fatima, she asked that the 
Holy Father consecrate Russia to 
her Immaculate Heart. That was 
quite an understatement of Our 
Ladv and from some church au- 


displeases our Lady? 
would be to get in touch with or- 
ganizers of dance parties In school 
snHetv club unlts and 


fraternities, society club units and 
the like. Publicity, I think, can do 
much to ask woman not to wear 
immodest dresses, explaining the 
moral Implications of such a prac- 
tice; an appeal can be rhade to 
Catholic girls to exemplify modesty 
In dress. 

"3. With regard to the Family 
Consecration to the Immaculate 
Heart of Mary, parish Catholic ac- 


thorities. we gather that she was ‘j tion groups rnay be asked to work 
really asking for prayers In order j its propagation in the same

Dona AURORA A. DE QUEZON 
"Pure and spotless must the vic- 
tim be that the sacrifice may he 
acceptable.” These words of .Jose 
Rizal, naturally come to our minds 
in thl.^ hour of our national be- 
reavement. For Dona Aurora, a 
vlelim of our fratricidal hatred.s, is 
Indeed a pure and spolless martyr. 

Divine Providence, has willed to 
demand from our countjw the ino.st 
precious life of our citizenry. I.et 
u.s hope and pray, that this our 
great loss will serve the great pur- 
pose of opening the eyes and touch- 
ing the hearts of all our nationals, 
that thi.s fratricidal strife may he 
put to an end. 

Doha Aurora, will be remember- 
ed by many nol)le deeds, but 1 like 
to l/elieve that our posterity will 
consider that her appeal to the na- 
tion, through the Catholic Hiei’ar- 
chy, for a month of May dedicated 
to our I^ady Mediatrix of all Graces 
hollowed with prayer.s and penan- 
ces, is her .spiritual testament to 
her beloved country, and as such 
the most significant of her good 
deeds. 

With the .sacrifice of her life in 
the altar of her country, her ap- 
peal acquired a very poignant 
I meaning. She had to die a mailyr 
I of our fratricidal strifes, for us to 
: realize that we are facing a great 
; -national cri.sis, which demands 
from all of us, more prayers, more 
penances, and a new way of life, if 
this our beloved country of ours 
is to he .saved.

SPIRITUAL ^ TECHNICAL ° INTECRATED EDUCATION 

In France more thon a century ogo. Father James Dujarie founded the 
Brothers of Saint Joseph to set up trade schools and schools of agriculture. 
This was the beginning of what later on came to be known as the Congrego- 
tion of the Holy Cross, which in time invaded the U. S. and Canada, and estab- 
lished the famous Notre Dame University in Indiana, ond the no less famous 
Oratory of St. Joseph of Bro. Andre in Montreal. 

Moved by the some spirit to contribute to an integrated education of the 
mind and heart, FEATI Institute and Arancta Institute have been founded. 

We know that our work is just in its very beginnings, ond for from the high 
goal that we have set for ourselves. But it is time that we define the goal. 

If we could impart to our student not merely a technicol trade and werdly 
wisdom, but mere importont still, if we could mould his character to a life of 
virtue, in an atmosphere of love and concern for his neighbor. . . 

If we could Veoch his henrt to the end that he will always love our Most 
BJesscd ^'^irgin Mary os h's rye Mother in heaven. . . 

If he leaves our portals fired with a burning desire to lead the life of an in- 
teorai Cotholic, animated with on aposto*ic zeal to bring our country back to 
our God . . . 

If these our dreams could come to fruition ... 

Then we can be satisfied that our two Institutes are contributing to make 
our beloved country a better place to live l-i that our work is being blessed 
fey God!

WHO REALLY 


of the 


assumes no responsibility for them* 


Five members of the 
House of Representatives 
demanding in a resolu- 
tion the resignation of In- 
terior Secretary Sotero Ba- 
luyut and Brigadier General 
Alberto Ramos of the Cons- 
tabulary. The reason is — 
they <the Secretary and the 
General) failed to restore 
and maintain peace and or- 
der thereby causing the am- 
buscade and killing of the 
Quezon family. From the 
context of the resolution, ap- 
parently, the ambuscade and 
murder of Mrs. Auroia '1 j- 
2 ?on and 11 members of her 
party is blamed on Secreta- 
I'y Baluyut and General Ka- 
mos. Now, addressing one’s 
sense of fairness — Is this 
a justifiable accusation? 

The death of the most be- 
loved Ladv of our country 
undoubtedly angered every- 
one who possesses innate 
sense of justice and natural 
abhorrence for lawlessness. 
They feel the brutality oI 
i.he ambuscade and hate the 
treachery employed in the 
murder. They condemn the 
savagery of the misdeed and 
c4-y with pain for the con- 
temptuousness of the sin. 
Yet, Mrs. Quezon’s death 
and that of her 11 compa- 
nions should be attribute '' to 
no fault of any itnlividiial 
public official, much less to 
any one who personally nou- 
rishes genuine esteem and 
affection for her, like See. 
Ealuyut and Gen. Ramos, 
but onlv to those wh^ per- 
petrated the most sinister of 
crimes. 

Mrs. Quezon ^)cd. a vic- 
tim of a foul and savage 
deed — savage deeds which 
ordinarily occur in ries 

refuted tO be haven of ci- 
Hization. How many mur- 
ders of that kii.d lake pTac# 
in England? There are 
plenty, hence, Scotland Yard 
has always plenty to do. 
How many assassinations, 
brutalities, and other con- 
temntibJe crimes occur al- 
most dailv in New York, 
Ch'-cago, San Francisco, and 
other big and important ci- 
ties in the United States, or 
in France, etc? Yet, do peo- 
ple ever sa 3 f that there is no 
peace and order in England, . 
America, or" France? Do 
brother public officials and 
especially members of Con- 
gress ever demand on that 
account, the resignation of , 


IS TO BLAME? 

any member of the Cabinet 
of such countries, or their 
President or Prime Minister? 
And why do we have to do 
it in the young RepvMic of^ 
the Philippines? 

That there is a big num- 
ber of lawless elements in 
our country is and should be 
an admitted fact. Likewise, 
that the problem is the con- 
cern of the whole govern- 
mental machinery should 
be admitted. There 
should be co-operation and 
coordinated action in solv- 
ing the question among all 
public officers and func- 
tionaries. 

If I may suggest, I should 
say that the primary cause 
of the lawlessness should be 
determined, so that once 
known, remedies thereof may 
be applied for by means of 
legislative action. For in- 
stance, let me ask. Did 
these lawless people or some 
of them become dissidents 
because they are discontent- 
ed and unhappy and 
their grievances are not 
heeded to? If this is the 
cause of their being lawless, 
then Congress can surely do 
something to stop their state 
of discontentment. Or, do 
these people or some of 
them continue to be lawless 
because they cannot expect 
any more amelioration under 
our present penal system, so 
they had to stick to it? Or 
still another, do these people 
or some of them, continue to 
be lawless because they have 
no alternative but to be so? 
Or, are these people or some 
of them profess to be law- 
less because pursuing other 
doctrines of government and 
acting under pressure from 
foreign propagandists, they 
have undertaken to harrass 
the adherents of Democra- 
cies to gain followers and 
adherents of their own ideo- 
logies? 

If anybody is to blame for 
the Boncabong massacre be- 
sides the perpetrators of the 
abominable crime, it is not 
only Secretary Baluyut or 
General Ramos who assumed 
their respective offices bai'e- 
ly three months ago, but it 
should be the entire govern- 
ment machinery including 
Congressmen, for failure to 
give what it is due the people 
it is bound to seiwe.

ACHILLES L. AY ALIN, Manila. — A cold-blooded 
and premeditated murder against the well-loved 
Quezon, Buencamino and San Agustin families, has 
just been perpetrated. The wanton knaves who 
F>€rpetrated this unthinkable Nueva Ecija massacre 
deserve damnations. Our government, through its 
armed forces, should once and for all eradicate 
this kind of lawlessness so that the people will real- 
ly feel that it really cares for the security of every 
human being, and to prove that it is strong and 
capaljje enough to safeguard our own homeland.

Doiia Aurora’s Bungalow 

By Paciencia Torre-Guzman 

Photos by Espinosa Studio, Baguio 


T here is one photograph we 
would have liked to include 
in this double spread feature 
of the Baguio residence of 
late Doha Aurora Aragon Quezon 
whose .violent death lies heavy still 
in the hearts of a people who have 
grown to love and honor her as 
they did her husband. The pictuie 
we refer to is no less a portrait 
of Better living than the best 
iAiotograph of the most e^fluisite 
home. It is a CEtndid shot of chub- 
by, gurgling, ciirly-haired 15- 
months’ old “Pongoy.” as his 
young mother, Nini, calls Philip 
IV, kissing his grandmother. This 
photographed, when we saw it. 
occupied a choice place on Doha 
Aurora’s dressing table. 

To our niind, this picture best 
symbolized the tender yet strong 
bonds of love with which Doha 
Aurora drew the members of her 
faniUy to her. Her success as a 
public figure side by side with her 
husband was only a reflection of 
her success as a mother of model 
children and as the hub of the 
family circle. Until her death last 
week, Doha Aurora was full of life 
and living and plans for country 
and home. 

D Of^A AURORA’S Baguio home, 
constructed only recently to' re- 
place the one which was des^oyed 
during the war, is hot just aho&er 
vacation home. In it are family 
heirlooms, prize furniture of pre- 
war vintage, dearly beloved family 
photograplis. We could imiagine 
what it would feel to live in a 
house like this where every piece 
of furniture has a story to tell, 
only now, anything that they had 
to say would merely be so many 
slivers in the heart for those who 
imve loved and r&p^ted the Lady 


of the Manor. 

The Quezon bungalow is of the 
patio-rancho type which cuts a 
gay, light-hearted silhouette in the 
sim. It is on Legarda Street, away 
from the ain of carnival activity. 
This district we have grown to 
think of as the Santa Mesa 
Heights of Haguio. 

The bmigalow has been sensibly 
laid on level ground, not on ter- 
raced glades which makes coming 
and going a strictly huff-and-puff 
business. For all this sanity, the 
bungalow has nbt lost the ad- 
vantages of a scenic view all 
around. There are the pine-covered 
hills at the back, the Burnham 
Bowl now turned cariiiValistic, the 
city proper out front, and the 
beautiful establishments perched 
on distant ledges to right and left^ 

A white-balustraded open patio 
hugs the front part of the bunga- 
low and provides hearty welcome 
to all callers. A bright gMden para- 
sol shades tables and chairs which 
are arranged most informally on 
the patio. Shining red floor re- 
flects ‘Tongoy’s” carriage and as- 
sorted playthings as well as bloom- 
ing pots cf petunias, roses, rtiil 
floras, and allied flora. This ter- 
race has been the setting for many 
family snapshots taken by the late 
amateur photographer and iiews- 
paperman, Philip Buencamino m, 
tile man ‘Tongoy” incoherently 
but lovingly referred to as **Da- 
da.” 

It would not be fair to leave the 
terrace without making mention 
of the natural mountain stones 
which hjive been set and mounted, 
much like pearls and amethysts, 
on the store abuttment of the fire- 
place and on the twin pillars or- 
nately guarding the main doorway. 

Nini and Philip and ’’Pongoy” 


who stuck to us at the terrace 
while our photographer messed it 
up, were now ^relieved by Mrs. 
Quezon herself who graciously 
helped set things aright in the 
living room before the camera 
bulbs flashed. 

From the doorway, we beheld 
to our right the meticulously ar- 
ranged main living room. Over by 
the window corner stands the 
grand piano complete with its em- 
broidered Spanish mantilla, flow- 
ers, and a two-leafed frame hold- 
ing a photograph of Do5a Aurora 
as a yoimg matron and a portrait 
of President Quezon in his young 
days. 

THE fireolace looks incidental 
* but verv functional. It has been 
tucked in among the built-ins and 
proudly holds on its maritel shelf 
the towering sculptured image of 
the Sacred Heart. The built-ins in 
this fnstance was built out of a 
felt need. In this home of treasures 
and relics and souvenirs, built-ins 
are architectural surprise: 

The livitig room furniture com- 
posed of four huge pieces struck 
us as soniething so rare as to be 
available these days. Mrs. Quezon 
explained that it was the very 
same .set they had in the Stat^; 
Here was a lesson in. care and pre- 
servation: the royal blue brocade 
upholstery and the shining wopden 
arms and piping did look as if the 
set' only came with the house. 

The life-size studio portrait, of 
the late President smiled down at 
us from its niche on the right wall 
as we passed by through the fabu- 
lous archway to the dining room. 

In the dining room, Mrs. Quezon 
took pains to show us the painting 
of Philippme fruits, the only ob- 
j^t salvaged from the burning 


Pasay home at liberation time^ tt 
was saved, Mrs. Quezon told us, bs^ 
a Swiss gentlemen who rolled u^ 
the painting in a bamboo tube 
and carried it with him all the way 
to Switzerland and then to the 
States to restore the painting to 
the Qiiezons. 

A striking arrangement in the 
dining room is the bay window fit- 
ted with leather upholstered seats. 
At the center is the six-seat dining 
table ^uiit in the clsissic manner, 
All over the living • and dining 
rooms are Igorot hand-carved ob- 
jects, presents from grateful 
friends. v 

Mrs. Quezon took us to her bed- 
room to show us the well-planned 
altar occupying Srabtitfally all of 
one wall. The “Lady of Fatima,” 
which she had ordered made re- 
cently, reigned over Her altar. On 
the night table beside her bed was 
a book about the “Lady of Fati- 
ma.” Rooming with her was her 
grandson, his crib neatly arranged 
alongside Dona Aurora’s bed. 

The bungalow has three other 
rooms for the rest 6f the family 
and an efficient kitchen on the 
backside. The garage adjoins a 
corner of, the terrace. 

Even as we write this, the very 
day Doha Aurora and Baby and 
Philip were ambushed near Baler, 
the shock of their violent death is 
almost a physical pain. It was not 
so long ago that we were all out 
in that bungalow in Baguio, talk- 
ing so freely and so intimately as 
if we were life-long friends. Now 
it makes one feel so insecure, so 
anchorless, so much like a puppet 
of fate. But life is like that: after 
the disgust; at the violence, the 
grief at the death, one feels re- 
signed and brave enough to go on 
dearly remembering a;nd living. #

Porlrail of a 

Gracious Lady 

By Vicente B. Garcia 


Tfce srean did not rob Mrs. Qneion of her charm and vitality as thesb 
pictures taken before her death and before her marriage demonstrate., 


T oday, only eight short days 
after the mortal remains of 
Mrs. Aiirora Aragdn Quezon 
had been gently laid to rest 
beside her husband la the family 
plot at the Cementerio del Norte, 
there are those of us who, lost 
♦nee again in the routine of work- 
aday existence, have quite forgot- 
ten the object lesson which her 
tragic death should have for us. 

To those who were not fortunate 
enough to have known Mrs. Que- 
zon personally, it is perhaps dif- 
ficult to keep her memory alive, 
to take her passing as a deep per- 
sonal loss. But to tho^ who knew 
her, who looked on her as **the 
most revered woman in the Phil- 
ippines,” who mourn her passing 
as much as they mourn the death 
of the things she stood fo?— things 
like decency and compassion, use- 
fulness and an abiding love for 
fellowmen — sorrow is a living 
thing. They mourn and remem- 
ber. . o 

There was nothing complex 
about Mrs. Quezon- As friends re- 
member her, she was ^n exceeding- 
ly unaffected, iheredibly humble 
person. Tliere was neither pose 
nor sham about her, and she had 
little patience with those who put 
on airs. 

A young woman, whose associa- 
tion with the Quezon dates as far 
back as her grade schc^l friend- 
ship with Nini, likes to tell this 
story: 

One late afternoon, after a hard 
and exhausting day, Mrs. Quezon 
decided to go up to her room and 
rest. She left explicit orders that 
under no circxunstances should she 
be disturbed. 

A few minutes later, an influen- 
tial politician ranking high in 
government councils drove up in 
his low-numbered car and sought 
an audience with her. He was a 
very important person and the 
maid was understandably at a 
loss. Finally, she went up to Mrs. . 
^ezon end asked whether she 




opportunity and the excuse to as* 
same snobb&h airs, to discard,. 11^ 
so many pieces of old rag, such 
of her acquaintances as cpuld not 
conceivably be of help to her. But 
she did nothing of the sort. Her 
friendliness and concern for the 
less fortunate among her friends 
grew even more marked.' 

If she made a fetish of helping 
the underprivileged and needy# It 
wasn’t because a woman of her 
soctal position and prestige was 
expected to do so. There was, in 
fact, not the slightest tinge of 
condescension on her part. She 
did what she did out of genuine 
desire to be of service. 

Why should an ailing woman, 
beginning to bend under the 
weight of her 61 years, shoulder 
so heavy and responsible a job as 
the chairmafi^iip of the Red Cross 
board of governors? Assuredly 
not for the money. She was 
wealthy enough not to have any 
fiscal worries and, besides; her 
position did not draw any remu- 
neration. Why. then, unless it 
was because she realized that with 
her experience, background and 
personal influence she could do 
good to thousands upon countless 
thousands of her countrymen? 

That Mrs. Quezon’s personality 
affected all those who had come 
In contact with her, Is amply de- 
monstrated In the case of Dr. Mer- 
cedes Grau-Santamarla, professor 
at the University of Santo Tom^ 
whoso biography of Mrs. Quezon' 
is soon to be published. 

Writes Dr. Santamarfa: ‘T can 
never forget the time when Mrs. 
Quezon granted me my first per- 
sonal interview. She was dressed 
In grey-blue, a color which set 
to advantage the silvery tint of 
her. wonderful hair . « . How gra-

would receive him. Mrs. Quezon 
said no, she was sorry, but could 
he please come at a later time? 

Not long after the departure of 
the politician, a group of three or 
four barefooted farmers knocked 
at the back door and diffidently 
asked to see Mrs. Quezon. They 
had a serious problem, they told 
the maid, and Mrs. Quezon was 
the only person who could be of 
help. 


The maid, remembering her or- 
ders dismissed them without fur- 
ther ado. ’They were leaving 
when they heard Mrs. Quezon’s 
voice calling them back. She had 
heard them and come down, her 
weariness forgotten for the mo- 
ment, to see what she could do. 
After a while, the farmers, faces 
alight and eyes shining with grat- 
itude, left, their mission accom- 
plished. 


But this tale can be topped by 
another one, this time related by 
her one-time secretary at the 
Philippine National Red Cross 
where Mrs. Quezon held office as 
chairman of the PNRC board of 
governors. 


A woman, 60 years old or there- 
abouts, walked in one day. Her 
plain cotton dress, run-down 
shoes and tired air all smacked of 
genteel poverty. On a slip of 
paper, she wrote her name and 
asked that it be brought to Mrs. 
Quezon. 


At. the time, the Red Cross was 
engaged in a fimd-raising cam- 
paign and Mrs.. Quezon was busi- 
ly presiding over a conference. 
But she took one look at the slip, 
hurriedly excused herself and 
rushed out and warmly embraced 
the woman. It turned out that 
they had been classmates at the 
Philippine Normal School some 30 
years before. Mrs. Quezon had 
not forgotten her lowly classmate. 


^ Quezon, it was the easiest 
thing for Mrs. Quezon to bask In 
the reflected glory cast by her 
famous spouse. More, she had the

tioas she wbs and how refined! 
The years, to from robbing her 
of her vitality, had merely made 
her more charming than , ever. 
She had a youngness, a joyous* 
xiess that time could' not crush. 
And 1 basked in the soft warmth 
of her cordiality, content to watch 
the flash in her eyes and listen 
to the unusually fine timbre of her 
vc^ee, . 

That ‘•fine voice” was seldom, if 
ever, Imown to rise in anger. It 
had a soft, musical quality about 
it And character. When used 
in singing her restive grandson to 
sleep, it was soothing, tender: 
when addressing a massed 
audience, it Instinctively com* 
manded attention and drew re* 
meet; and when telling a creepy 
^ost storyy-a pastime Mrs. Que* 
zon was partial' to of a moonless, 
windy night— it took on a vivid- 
ness that sent her young listeners 
cowering under blankets. 

IMHEN Mrs. Quezon smiled, her 
eyes crinkled up Into a smile, 
too. And they would crinkle even 
more deeply when she spoke of 
the pranks of her children when 
they were kids. ”Baby did this 
and that,” she would say, or “Ninl 
was such and such.” 

The reminiscent gleam, how- 
ever, would give way to something 
suspiciously like moisture when 
the talk veered to her late bus* 
band and she started summoning 
her earliest memories of a hand*

some, brilliant law student who 
‘ was 11 years her senimr. 

“He would take me on his lap,” 
she would say, “and tell me fas- 
cinating stories about a big, walled 
city called Manila.” 

She would say, “It was he who 
financed my Mhooling at the Nor- 
mal School, but it was a joke on 
him because illness prevented me 
from graduating/* 

The little matter of' a Normal 
school degree bothered neither of 
them for ve^ long, though, for 
Mrs. Quezon was to earn subse- 
quently, on the merit of her dis- 
tinguished achievements in vari- 
ous fields, three honorary doctorate 
degrees from thr ee se parate insti- 
tutions: UST, PWU, and Mary- 
grove College of Detroit, Michi- 
gan. 

Always an avid resuler, Mrs. 
^ezon, sometime in her teems, or- 
ganized what she grandios^y 
called the Baler Reading Circle 
^ and Library— a small collection of 
books which she had painstaking- 
ly accumulated during her student 
years. The townspeople, at that 
time just beginning to learn the 
rudiments of gngUsh, were ah- 
lowed free use the libarry. and 
there must have been q[aite a 
scramble for them. 

No doubt, the Baler library was 
among the first of its kind In the 
Philippines. It was probably on 
this basis that the entire ooBee- 
tion was turned over to the Ma- 
lacafian library in 1914. It was 


not until ^more than 20 years latar 
that Mrs. Quezon, as the wife of 
the first president of the Philip- 
pine Commonwealth, was tp fol- 
low her books Into the palace by 
the Pasig. 

■■ROM the pretty, bright-eyed, 
■ book-hungry child of the sleepy . 
town of Baler to the quietly com- 
petent First Lady at Malacafianu 
and on to the distinguished wom- 
an who met an unexpected death 
on a provincial highway, was -a 
long, long journey that had more, 
than its share of triumph and 
glory, gall and tragedy. 

There were the wonderfully idyl- 
lic days when the dashing Senate 
President and the shy, former li- 
brarian promised to love, honor 
and obey each other at a ceremony 
performed at the American Con- 
sulate in Hongkong on December 
14, 1918. T^here were the halcyon 
years when young Quezon's polit- 
ical star continued to rise; the, 
bitterness and frustration when, 
the couple's third daughter, Luisa 
Aragdh, caught sick and died after, 
a life of less than a year; the sat*^ 
Isfying sense of fulfillment during* 
their occupancy of Malacafian; 
the harrowing years of exile dur-. 
ing the (Pupation, climaxed by 
the feeling of Irreparable loss 
when President Quezon passed 
away at Saranac Lake.' There, 
too, were the bitter-sweet, chal- 
lenging post-Liberation days when, 
the bereaved family tried to re- 
cover their bearings In an un- 
familiar land of smoke and rub* 
bio. 

It was a long trail well wortb 
travelling. |#|

Yes, you are Viernes. You are a 
little god with a great big gun 
on your hip. Originally you had 
a Cause with which few of us, 
considering ourselves decent, had 
quarrel; but you have grown big- 
ger than your cause and now you 
are Viernes and you boast of wo- 
man-killing. Off and on there is 
drivel that “it was not the Huks.’* 
No, it very likely was not the Huks 
as an organization, but certainly 
it was some of the Huks in an or- 
ganization running amuck for lack 
of leadership control. Definitely 
it was Viernes, so proudly claim- 
ing credit for his armed prowess... 

Down here in the lethargic low- 
lands, Viernes, there is a moral 
and mental evasiveness which 
avers we didn’t do it, you didn’t 
do it, “they” did it... “they”

for banditry. Thus we play pol- 
itics with the devil. Thus we 
avoid saying anything nasty about 
the likes of you lest we ourselves 
get a bullet in the back. The word 
for this, of course, is cowardice, 
the language not having changed 
since the days the guerrillas scout- 
ed for and held the camps you 
now use. But a people can beco^me 
only so afraid, Viernes, then no 
more; once the saturation point

can answer for himself, and by 
that token I for me. You acclaim* 
yourself one of the "little people** 

— the exploited tenant, the under- 
paid laborer, the nameless men 
and women in millions as against 
the unjustly favored few. As one 
of the “little people,” you have 
spoken with blind and final hat- 
red in the merciless murder of 
Mother Quezon, Baby, Philip, Ber- 
nardo, the others I may not have 
known personally but whose lives 
were equally precious. Nor have 
their numan rights been more 
savagely denied, than the Aves 
of men, women and children slain 
in hloodv continuity through four 
years of pretended peace. 

Think you. Viernes, that all the 
“little people” are you? How about 
me. and the millions like me? We 
have known labor in the fields, 
dishwashing in restaurants, the 
picking and packing of fruit. We 
are the little people, too, come 
earlier to maturity perhaps than 
you. Perhaps our fight for the 
same things is longer and harder 
but, God give ii« stren.gth to keep 
it so, cleaner. We reason with 
ideas, not with bullets. Bullets 
are for defense against aggres- 
sors, not for our brothers, not 
for the few truly noble in an ad- 
mittedly contemptible landlord 
class, certainly not for those 
hundreds of simple. Ignorant, 
struggling workers men like yon

ambush of Mother Quezon and

MESSAGE TO THE MOUNTAINS | 

U oiitnuM*(j from | 


V fv*^d it.s«ll a Class war, Vier- 
ifH. .tVjust a war. shuotiiig blind. 
M«>re Tor The, establishment ot 
our own et:o than the <ause of 
he workers. By what you have 
lone for your own brutish satis- 
acrion, you have lost most of the 
;auis made by labor and peasant 
luons throughout the country. 
nc*h by inch, ‘two steps forward, 
•me step backward*', they were 
vetting somewhere. You have 
>bbed them of gains. . and 
vvhat have you substituted? 
i« unremitting enmity, resistance 
vcive and passive, contempt of 
'undreds of thousands .of people 
.0 which the “big shot ’ class is 
a small iiid not very admirable 
imrcentage. T. who never loved 
he tenant system, have nowhere 
u> go now. for I hate the likes of 
vou as much as the cacique and 
nis usurious wife. . . Essentially 
oil are the same kind, both of 
)U abusing power, he the power 
money, you the power of a gun. 
<>u re both ruthless, both cruel, 
}.>ih violently egoistic. I hope it 
'ives you surprise to discover to 
whom you are blood-brother. 1 am 
even willing to admit, while claim- 
ng neither of you has the right, 
^hat you^ VTernes, dispose of your 
ictiius swiftly while your land- 
'nrd-brother in vicious inhumanity 
Kills by a slower process. 

In your ego. you natuxally think 
>ou accomplished your ambush 
^11 by your little self. .Vever will 
ou realize that the landlords and 
he tycoons are your real com- 
'Munders. that it is less inconven- 
!» uce to them to have you fighting 
iiut dying in the hills than driv- 
ing them to their wits' end 
with strikes, court cases, fairer 
laws. And they do not weep 
«>o greatly nor at long length 
>ver Mother Quezon’s death, 
for she was your friend more than 
heirs. Believe me, they are even 
(leased that you have made this 
iiorrible deed that finally gets the 
field action against you that they 
hemselves have never been able 
o" marshal. Where they lie. 
Mother Quezon knows this, Baby 
knows it, Philip knows it. and if 
rhe dead can weep, and this I 
wish 1 did not know, they weep 
for you. Hesitating on Nini's 
iloorstep, fumbling for words of 
vomfort. needing to receive as 
give it, I cannot find the kind 
word of explanation. I cannot tell 
her why this had to happen, why 
a maniac by the name of Viernes 
takes pride in slaughter, why the 
grieving is short-lived. For what 
you have done to Nini. which 
equals what you did to all the rest, 
i hate you. Believe me. you can 
n<*ver hate me as 1 hate you. And 
hating you, I bless the memory of 
Colonel Roberto Mata who hunted 
down and killed in a cornfield one 
of us who committed highway rob- 
bery; 1 cherish the memory of 
Colonel Leon Z. Cabalhin, who 
tried and executed a rapist; I am 
even humble before Marking 
whose headquarters was not only 
a guerrilla military school and 
hospital but also a reformatory 
where he personally by a combi- 
nation of persuasion and force 
made his followers into “gentle- 
man .fighters or I’ll break your 
;oddani head." i might quarrel 
with his language but never with 
results. 




.: Quezon were alive, be would' 
rip down the fence, toss the sit- 
ters to their sides, talk votes with 
voters, say it with bullets to kill- 
ers. Por rrime, corruption, for 
the distressing bad behavior found 
in the highest offices in the land, 
he would turn this our beloved 
country upside down to set it 
right again. .-Viid it would not have 
needed the death of .Mother Que- 
zon to pinpoint the raging of a 
1 ‘ivil war. .\iiybody’s violent and 
unmerited death would have suf- 
ficed. 

Who first fought for Social 
Justice? Who went to you un- 
der the burning Pampanga sun. 
through the .Muiloz floods, to the 
farthest outposts to see you, hear 
you. help you? Who had long 
conferences with that other great 
man. Pedro Abad Santos, and for 
hours stood before a hundred 
thousand of you at a time in sim- 
ple. honest debate? It was neither 
politics nor patience; it was for 
love of you. 

He knew about the creek dam- 
med by a rich man to make a 
fishpond at the expense of living 
water for hundreds of your fa- 
milies along the dried water- 
way. . . He knew about the caci- 
que’s usurious wife and the 10- 
(^eiitavo bottle of mercurochrome 
she debitted against you for P2.- 
00. He knew how insufficient 
your share of the crops and, too, 
how barren the earth for so many 
mouths. . . I know he knew, for 
he allowed me to study reports 
meant only for him and his Ca- 
binet and to study them only un- 
der Vargas’ watchful eye lest I 
make off with one he would him- 
self study further; many times I 
studied until 11 o'clock or niid- 
night in Vargas' .Malacanan of- 
fice. And who was I? — just a 
r-ub reporter, for a long time with 
more of a haircut than a name, 
yet even I could ask this great 
man questions, even I could 
quench the thirst for knowledge 
with a President's secretary my 
librarian. 

.VoLie of us was too humble for 
his attention, neither you nor I. 

.\8 he helped an ignorant, eager 
girl, so did he valiantly help you. 

He knew that what you wanted, 
the familiar but barren land un- 
der your feet, was at best an emp- 
ty heritage, so he pointed you 
to new land, to virgin land, and 
he loaned you the money to go, 
gave you NLSA supervision, fo- 
cused national interest on you. 

Do you think the landlords were 
happy to have him ease you out 
of your bondage? He stood strong 
and alone in his humanity, and 
for this vou slew his family. 
Your own revered Pedro Abad 
Santos would cry out against your 
savagery. Wherever the gentle 
old bachelor lies in his hero’s 
grave surely his heart must ache 
for his political children who have 
become wliat'? 

All Ihrough a great President's 
years of service. Mother Quezon 
helped her husband and in that 
capacity was our first, and last, 
T.ady of the J^and. Wherever 
there were those in service to 
country, she was there, not in self- 
glorification but in assistance to 
Him and to them... among the 
teachers, the nurses, the writers, 
tlie welfare w’orkers, the lawyers. 




SHE read iiio.sr «*l the speeche.s she ha<l to deliwr in the course of

Lilli ami Viiiba.s.sador (’arlos P, Ftoniiilo form part of her 


the doctors. . . and among the fac- 
tory workers rolling cigars by 
hand, the students timidly choos- 
ing a walk of life, the moUiers 
in the nuericulture centers, the 
workers w’ho had built the 
bridge. . . ever among the poor, 
to whom she gave her life, only 
to have it taken by force. 

Baby was the girl who should 
have been a boy. For her who 
is dead and cannot herself ask. in 
what way did Baby harm you? — 
by blasting public indifference to- 
ward the lepers' misery? sweat- 
ing for funds for the Ylac slum 
schools? cramming law into her 
head, the better to carry on her 
father’s work? a fragile body, 
driven by an untiring spirit? 
Baby's sharp tongue and cutting 
wit were only for us i n u r- 
ed to it, understanding and lov- 
ing her for it. Never did she jab 
at you, to whom she was fiercely 
loyal. It is even possible that she 
was a friend to me because she 
considered me one of you. “Hi,” 
she would say, “How’s Yay the 
Underprivileged? Madrigal still 
overw'orking and underfeeding 
you?” And if I mourned my fi> 
nancial state, she would jibe, 
“Don’t be stupid! Strike!” 
Though the years, I was grate- 
ful for her frankness, for her 
rough, unpitying, challenging 
friendship, for her equality and 
because once, when we quarrelled, 
and she stamped her foot and 1 
stalked out in anger, when I 
reached the office she was on the 
telephone to apologize. . . 

Philip, too, is dead. What dra- 
matic irony that you butchered 
him. For Philip and Baby were 
your open door to a half-million 
hectares of free, virgin land... 
Only one other person knows what 
Baby and Philip knew — that 


there was a place for you to go, . 
land for you, a new start. That 
person is Judge Barrera. He 
knows. Ask him. ^ 

Jt started in the time of Pres- 
ident Roxas, the time when peo- 
ple, despite atrocities, gave you 
the benefit of the doubt. They 
c!ould not see what Roxa.i saw 
then, that the language you un- 
derstand is the language of vio- 
lence. They had no quarrel with 
your cause, and only a doubt as 
to your methods. Fatuously they 
thought that secretly 'siphoning 
you out of congested areas, spirit- 
ing you away under the noses of 
the soldiers, leaving them with 
nothing to fight and thereby sav- 
ing their lives too, would rescuse 
you from the circumstances of in- 
justice and hunger which justi- 
fied your desperate rebellion. 

It was so agreed. Baby and 
Philip would let you know if and 
when... 1 would point where. All 
your problemms were being con- 
sidered — food, tools, instruction, 
tree medicine, schools, markets for 
your produce, immunity frpm the 
past. . . 

It is your friends you have 
killed, your friends more than 
mine, more than anybody's. You 
snatched a necklace, and lost a 
loving heart. You tore a jewel 
from the one ear in the Philip- 
pines that would still listen to 
.vou. You poured bullets into frail 
Baby at the dawn of a legal career 
for the underprivileged. YoV ’ 
mowed down a man who called 
out to you. not for himself but 
those who defended you where 
you could not defend yourselves. 
There is little loss In hating you- 
you itaiinot <lo worse to your ene- 
mies than you have done to vout 
friemls. — jf.

SOMEWHERE TN NUEVA ECI- 
JA, May 7.— Ten Huks were mowed 
down with gunfire and killed along 
the banks of the Umiray river by 
i a joint PC-civilian guard force com- 
bing the Bongabon-Baler border 
Thursday, a belated report received 
here stated. 

The government troops intercept- 
ed a band of 20 Huks as it tried to 
cross the Umiray river. Ten were 
verified killed following close-range 
firing. The rest of the group, shed- 
ding their clothes and in spite of 
their wounds, .swam acrass the river 
to the opposite bank and melted 
in to the dense undergrowth. ^ | 

Intelligence reports received in' 
Infanta. Quezon, said that the dissi- 
dents had cached a quantity of 
arms and ammunition somewhere 
in Quezon which, according to the 
same report, were landed by sub- 
marine. Efforts, to plot the location 
of the cache of arms have so far 
proved fi’uitles.s. 

Meanwhile, it is believed that the 
dissidents have moved their head- 
quarters from the Sierra Madre 
mountains on the Quezon sidp short- 
Iv after the massacre of Mrs. Que- 
zon and 11 other members of her 
partv. 

A group of Dumagat natives who 
know the terrain in Infanta have 
been g'liding government troops in 
the location of hide-outs. The 
Umiray river area .‘served as head- 
j quarters for the Anderson guerril- 
I las that saw action during the oc- 
! cupation. 

While efforts to locate the di.ssi- 
dent hideout have so far been in 
vain, the entire Umiray' area has 
virtually been marked “off-limits,” 
with government forces on a con- 
stant*^ patrol of the surroundings. 
Intelligence officers have not given 
up hopes of locating the cache and 
believe that some Huk runner 
might one of these day.s try to scout 
about the area to see if the stores 
can be safely recovered. 

Another report states that Luis 
M. Taruc, Huk .supremo, is in hid- 
ing somewhere near Mt. Susong T)a 
laga which is part of the Sierra

Another Huk being used as an in- 
former is Commander “Stalin” who 
is attached as undercover man for 
the 87th PC Compam.y in Dinalupi- j

While PC combat troops are busy * 
in the quest of the Quezon ambush 
group, other bands of dissidents 
have taken advantage of the ab- 
sence of PC forces in otlier areas 
and pounce on defenseless commun- 
ities. 

At 9:30- Tliyrsday night, a Huk 
band entered barrio Kalickid Este, 
near the landing field in the out- 
skirts of Cahanatuan. All male in- 
habitants of the barrio were lined 
up in Japanese fashion in a clearing 
while the i’ 4 ist of the dissidents en- 
! tered the houses and carted away 
food stocks, clothes, and jewelry.

Bereaved Home 

The Oiezon house on Gflmore Avenue, is hushed in grief 


N owhere may one find a keener 
and more profound concern over 
the sudden death of Mrs. Aurora Que- 
zon than in her own home at Gilmore 

Ave. now draped with quiet while • 

the remaining members of her house- 
hold accept their lot in silence. 

Occupied by the Quezons after their 
return from the States, the house has 
seen many a change. In these photos 
one finds testimony of the simple, 
ouiet life that its occupants led. Mi^. 
Quezon us^ to have her room on the 
second floor but finding that she was 
suffering from a weak heart, she roov- 
^ to another room on the first 
bringing vidth her thd large 
of her late husband (photo on right). 


This room gives further evidence of 
the pious life that she led. On a bed, 
immediately after the massacre, a book, 
‘‘Our Lady of Ught,’' was found, pres- 
umably b^ause she had been reading 
it until she left for the fateful trip 
to Baler. 

Because their grief may 
helped but not forgotten, Nini and 
Nonong Quezon expect to have a f^ 
of their relativ^^ with them in the 
future. The former atmosphere of the 
Quezon house at Gilnwre may not 
again be recaptur^: the bereaved ones 
may only look forward now to finding 
solace among the things that remind 
them, as nothing else can of a sim- 
ple happy life with the departed ones^

CABAXATI’AN, Nueva Ecija, 
IVfav 8. — Further intensifying in* 
t/'lligenc^ Y'.’ork in connection with 
the 0.ie7on ambush, Lt Fidel 
Amante, assistant intelligence and 
investigation officer of the Nueva 
Ecija command, early yesterday 
morning picked up six men of 
barrio Sicsican, Talavera. suspected 
of having given aid to Huks. 

Those picked up are at present 
detained 'for questioning. It was 
also gathered intelligence officers' 
are looking for relatives of Identifl-- 
ed commanders of the group which 
ambushed Mrs. Quezon and her 
party late last month to check up 
the possibility that jewelry and 
other valuables taken from victims 
might have been turned over to 
them. 

Five other suspects taken in the 
otlier night at barrio Tabuating, 
San Leonardo were released yes- 
terday after they were screened. 

Board Member Sixto Lustre laud- 
ed the members of the Nenita 
I I 'nit for the human treatment 
I accorded to tbe five suspects dur-j 
' ing the investigation and for! 
promptly releasing the five when; 
found to be law-abiding citizens. 

The Nenita Unit last night gave' 
the “Sire treatment" to Huk-infeVt’

With barrio La Fuente as spring- 
board, Nenita annored columns 
fanned out in a three-pronged 
drive with a Huk concentration 
as the objective. 

The town officials and promi-l 
nent residents of Licab yesterday ! 
afternoon fled to other places for 
their safety following the withdra-

This was the story brought here 
last night by Licab Police Chief 
Antonio Gorospe. He conferred 
With Board Member Lustre who

MONDAY, MAY 9, 1949 23 NEWS PAGES 



By JAMES G. WINGO 


WASHINGTON. May 9.— Since 
the end of the war the US press 
has been publishing nearly every 
day dispatches and special arti- 
cles reporting civil warfare, bandi- 
try or wanton shootings in the 
Philippines. The total effect of 
these stories has been to give the 
average newspaper reader the im- 
pression that the Philippines sadly 
lacks peace and order and that 
the government of the indepen- 
dent republic appears unable to 
place lawless elements under con- 
trol. 

This impression may be wrong, 
but it is the general Philippine 
picture that has been created in 
recent years in one American mind. 


It recalled reports that the Phil- 
ippine Government had balanced 
its budget, that several major in- 
dustries were back to prewar level, 
that 1948 exports were valued at 
$320 million (as compared to 
1947’s $265 million) and that ele- 
mentary schools had 3.8 million 
pupils (double the prewar enroll- 
ment). The Sun concluded reas- 
suiingly: “Shocking as is the 

murder of the family of a former 
President and national hero, the 
incident should not lead those un- 
familiar with the situation to jump 
to the conclusion that the new re- 
public is in a state of anarchy.'’ 
The New York Times came 
much nearer to expressing the 
American people’s feelings than 
the Baltimore paper. In its edi- 
torial, “Philippine Outrage,” it 
greeted the ambush murder of Mrs. 
Quezon and companions “with 
grief, horror and disappointment.” 
The Times grieved for losing 
“some good friends.” Its horror 
stemmed from “the senseless de- 
pravity of this sort of outrage.” It 


If previously there was any doubt ' could not see any “conceivably

The senseless killing of Mrs.

arose “from this blow to our high 
hopes that law and order had been 
fully restored in the Philippines.”

Manuel Quezon and her daughter, 
who were both well known in the 
United States, and several others 
was a severe .shock to the Ameri- 


Mrs. Quezon and her children 
were always near the President. 
Giving up almost any sort of a 
good time for themselves, the Que- 
zon womenfolk organized Wash- 
j ington Filipino women and their 
American friends to do Red Cross [ 
work regularly. Manuel Jr. (;“No- j 
nong”) attended school and made 
excellent grades, to the great pride ' 

of his father. 

» 

Before leaving the Philippines in 
1947, I went to bid goodby to Mrs. 
Quezon. When I asked her whe- 
ther I could* do some chores for 
her in Washington, she told me 
to convey her best wishes to a 
large number of people, mostly the 
little people with whom she had 
been associated in wartime Red 
Cross work. When she heard Ma- 
ria Aurora upbraiding me for not 
having visited them more often, 
she kindly told “Baby” that she 
knew I had been tied down by my 
official duties. 


immediate comment — “awful ter- 
rible” — when he was first inform- 
ed of the tragedy expresses cor- 
rectly the reaction of the people of 
this country. 

The news came too late for the 
morning newspapers, but most 
people going to work heard it over 
the radio before leaving their 
homes. The late morning and ear- 


Despite President Quirino’s first- 
reaction doubt that the Hukbala- 
haps could not have killed Mrs. 
Quezon because she was so much 
loved by them, they were played 
up even in the earliest stories. Sub- ,

The great Filipino heroine is 
Maria Clara. But this admirable 
fictional character, glorified in 
song and legend, does not hold a 
candle to Aurora Aragon, Quezon, 
the woman whose life, love, suffer- 
; ings, triumphs and death have im- 
measurably enriched the patriotic 
tradition of her country. 

In due time history will give her 
proper place among the all-time 
greats of the Philippines. The glo- 
ry that was hers was not all -re- 
flection from the great political 
star that rose from Baler and 
burned out four years and nine 
months ago and Li whose honored 
and beloved memoi*y she was mak- 
ing a pilgrimage to the old home- 
town when she was mercilessly 
mowed down. History will make 
known that many of those times 
Manuel Quezon faltered, it was the 
great woman by his side who fur- 
nished him the courage and the 
faith to carry on his good fight 
to a glorious conclusion. 


Because of her striking physi- 
cal and temperamental resem- 
blance to her father, “Baby” was 
the national favorite to perpetu- 
ate the Quezon tradition. Early 
in life she demonstrated an in- 
tense consciousness and great 
pride in her Filipino nationality. 
How far she would have gone had 
tragic fate not caught up with her 
in that pilgrimage to Baler, her 
people would never know now. 


I first met Felipe Buencamino 
in in battered Manila early in 
1945. He joined our Office of 
War Information and did splendid 
work as a reporter for our wartime 
paper Free Philippines. He and I 
became veiw good friends. He had 
become one of the most promising 
young men of the country when 
he was slain on the pilgrimage to 
the birthplace of his father-in-law, 
of whom he was a great admirer 
long before he was married to 
Maria Zenaida (“Nini”) Quezon. 
He always had a nice word for 
every instalment of The Last Days 1 
of Manuel Quezon which I wrote ' 


for the Philippines Free Press. 

Preparing for priesthood, “Nb- 
nong” will likely be able to bear 
the tragedy better than his sister, 
.who, in one blow, lost mother, sis- 
ter and husband. Rarely does such 
great loss come at one time to one 
so young.

PC Intelligence Agents 
Pick Up Huk Suspects 


CABANATUAN. Nucva Ecija, 
May 9 (ENS). — All government 
forces fighting: against Huk 

mountain positions were with- 
drawn today by Col. Napoleon 
Valcriano, head of the punitive 
foi^e against the killers of Mrs. 
Aurora Quezon. 

It w as held that objectives had 
been attained, with Huk rem- 
nants having escaped shellfire to 
the lowlands. Troops were or- 
dered to return to their respec- 
tive headquarters for a short rest 
before launching attack on Huk 
positions in the lowlands. — V. 

CABANATUAN, Nueva Ecija, 
"May 9 (ENS).-^There has been a 
lull in fighting in the Bongabon- 
Baier area indicating a regroup- 
ing of government forces prepara- 
toi-y to launching another phase 
of the punitivfe operations against 
the Huk murderers of Mrs. Que- 
zon. 

Meanwhile, intelligence activi- 
ties of the constabulary have been 
intensified, aimed at getting a clear 
picture of Huk positions and of 
the reported dispersal of the am- 
bush gang out into the plains los- 
ing themselves among the i-ural 
folk. No confirmation of this lat- 
ter report is available but suspect- 
ed Huk agents have been picked 
up by constabulary agents in the 
lowlands for intensive questioning. 

Lt. Fidel Amante, assistant in- 
telligence and investigation offi- 
cer, and his men picked up six 
persons at barrio Sicsican, Tala- 
vera Saturday suspected of aiding 
Huks. 

Another group of five Huk sus- 


pects was taken into custody by the 
Nenita Unit at barrio Tabuating, 
San Leonardo, but were relea.sed 
after being grilled. Tlie Ne- 
nita unit is headed by the famed 
officer, Lt. Col. Napoleon Valeria- 
no. Board Member Sixto Lustre 
commented favorably on the fair 
treatment which the investigated i 
persons received from the consta- 
bulary. < 

The five San Leonardo suspects 
gave their names as Lope Catacu- 
tan, Plavfano Ortiz, Carlos Fran- 
cisco, and Pedro Ramos. 

The town of Licab, near the 
Tarlac border became a ghost town 
Saturday when residents left the 
town upon learning that the con- 
stabulary detachment there under 
the command of Lt. Alejandro 
Agustin has pulled out. The peo- 
ple were afraid Huks might take 
advantage of the move and attack j 
the town. 

It "was learned later that Agus- 
tin’s detachment was to be re- 
placed by the 92nd PC company 
coming from Baler. Only Pohee 
Chief Antonio Grospe and two of- 
his six policemen were left in Li- 
cab. 

Municipal treasurer Sot^ro Gar- 
cia was reported to have fled to- 
wards Talavera with treasury 
funds. Councilors moved to the 
neighboring towns of Santo Do- 
mingo and Quezon. 

Licab Mayor Honorato Viardo at 
that time was in Manila to see In- 
terior Secretary Sotero Baluyut 
about arming civilians to bolster 
the town police force. — V.

MESSAGES OF 
CONDOLENCE FROM US | 

Messages of sympathy over the 
death of Mrs. Quezon and her j 
companions were received this 
week in Malacahan from United 
States Attorney General Tom C. 
Clark and Vincent Sheean, the 
noted writer. 

■ The text of Mr. Clark’s message 
follows : 

“The great tragedy suffered by 
the people of the Philippines in the 
untimely death of Mrs. Quezon and 
her daughter arouses the deepest : 
sympathy of Americans every- 
where in the loss which they have 
sustained and abhorrence of the 
cruel and violent circumstances 
which attended it. The many 
friends of the Quezon family here 
in Washington feel a deep sense 
cf personal sorrow. My sincercst 
sympathy.” 

Sheean’s. letter, which was ad- 
dressed to Private Secretary Fe- 
derico Mangahas, said in part: 

“We have all been shocked here 
at the murder of Dona Aurora 
Quezon, her daughter and those 
who accompanied her. It is a 
dreadful thing. I only have one 
other thing to say, which is that I 
thank God that Quirino was not 
there. I feel sure that he is re- 
served for decisive services, not 
only to the Philippines but to all 
of us.”

TOKYO; May 9 (AP)— Memo- 
rial services for the late Mrs. 
Aurora A. Quezon and her daugh- 
I ter Maria Aurora Quezon will be 
held in the general headquarters 
chapel at the center of Tokyo on 
Wednesday, the Philippines mis- 
sion announced today. 

Bemabe Africa, chief of the 
mission, will deliver an address 
at the services honoring the me- 
mory of the widow of former 
President Manuel L. Quezon. Mrs. 
Quezon, her daughter and 10 
others w'ere killed April 28 when, 
bandits ambushed a caravan in 
which they were traveling north 
of Manila. 


President Quirino led the na- 
tion last night in honoring the 
late Mrs. Aimora A. Quezon, chair- 
man of the Philippine National 
Red Cross, in necrological ser- 
vices held at the Ivlalacahan social 
hall. The services w’ere broad- 
I cast over five radio stations on 
I a nationwide hook-up. 

The President praised Mrs. 

! Quezon as “the greatest woman 
' in her countr\ .” Speaking of her 
! work in the Red Cross, President 
Quirino said: 

“When she undertook to head 
our National Red Cross, she sim- 
ply acceded to giving formal con- 
firmation, on her own right, of 
being in fact and in truth, mother 
to her people. She did not merely 
lend her name, great as it w'as, 
to the cause. She labored mighti- 
ly, doing yeoman service like 
everyone else who belonged pD it, 
and provided its deepest, most 
abiding inspiration.’' ^ 

The President added: Our peo- : 

pie may no t now know who w as 

( the greater, Quezon who was the 
! Father of his Country, or Aurora 
j Aragon Quezon, the truly sgn- 
bolic Mother of hef. race. But 
history will record them both as 
life greatest benefactors of this 
^ generation, and Mrs, 
her greatest woman m her coun 


President Quirino spoke of the 
“inspiring influence” of Mrs. Que- 
zon with reference to the career 
of the late President Quezon. He 
said: “Mrs. Quezon eventually 

became the rock of refugee and 
of strength to many a Filipino 
leader beset with the burden of 
the people’s problems. That she 
did all these quietly within the 
private sanctuary of the home is 
a grateful fact and commentary 
on the womanhood of this coun- 
try.” 

Manuel Lim, acting PNRC 
chairman, and Mrs. Trinidad F. 
Legarda, president of the Na- 
tional Federation of Women’s 
Clubs, were the other principal 
speakers.

FULL-SCALE DRIVE 
ON HUKS IMPENDS 


By JESUS BIGORNIA 
BilTlctin Staff Member 

CABANATUAN, May^ 9.— Hast- 
ily evacuated Hukbalahap en- 
campments thaRhad been set afire 
were all that units of a battalion 
combat team found when they 
reached the outlaws' stamping 
grounds at the Munoz, Talavera 
and San Jose areas last night. 

Units of the provincial constab-j 
ulary command and Philippine 
army struck in nocturnal opera- 
tions following the tactics of Col. 
Napoleon Valeriano, overall cam- 
paign commander, but encountered 
no dissidents. Abundant traces 
of Huks who apparently had fled 
in haste were found by the gov- 
ernment troops, however. 

Battle-tested reconnois- 
sance troops of the combat team 
executed a daylight push yester- 
day to Mataas na Kahoy and De- 
linquente in Talavera, but the elu- 
sive outlaws had left the area. The 
immediate vicinity, including Ba- 
sang Hamog, a notorious Huk lair, 
was bombarded all night, however, 
with artillery and .50 caliber ma- 
chineguns. 

Based near Baloc, Santo Domin- 
go, a battery of 75-millimeter guns 
poured between San Jose and 
Umingan. 

This softening process was be- 
lieved to be the herald of the final 
phase of operations. This week 
may see a full-scale offensive with 
all units participating* in a single 
coordinated blow. BCT headquart- 
ers assumed strict silence starting 
today in the interest of security. 

Col. Valeriano had been con- 
ferring hourly with his staff and 
officers of other commands and 
with operatives, presumably on the 
strategy to be employed in the 
coming push. 

Meanwhile, nightly raids by the 
Nenita outfit continued unabated. 
It was believed that the Huks 
were losing contact with their 
sympathizers in the towns. 

With the current operations in 
full blast, Huks were said to be 
hard pressed for food and other 
supplies with the result that they 
might be forced to a showdown 
soon. ' 


Governor Juan Chioco and your 
correspondent motored to Licab 
this afternoon and found only 
few residents in the town. Mos 
of the people had evacuated b 
neighboring towns. \ 

The governor advised the few! 
remaining residents to stay despite 
the withdrawal of PC troops from • 

;he area.; He promised to send 
a strong patrol to protect Licab 
residents. 

The remaining Licab residents 
said they were expecting a Huk 
attack momentarily' since the 
withdrawal of PC troops because 
of reports that the dissidents 
were poised to strike from Ga- 
bur. 

Many policemen had abandoned 
the town leaving it unprotected. 
Licab Vice Mayor Jose do los 
Santos and Municipal Secretary 
Nicanor Enriquez were the only 
officials left in the town. 


1,000 HEAVILY ARMED 
HUKS ENCIRCLED 

By JOVITO REYES 
Bulletin CoiTcspondent 

CABANATUAN, Nueva Ecija, 
May 9 — Around 1,000 heavily 
armed Huks under the overall 
command of Col. Jose Dimasalang 
de Leon and Major Jose Taguian 
were encircled in barrio Gabur, be- 
tween the towns of Licab and 
Aliaga, it was learned today. This 
spot was considered the most 
^ strategic Huk hiding place in the 
'' marshy lowlands along the Cliico 
, river coming from Candaba 
' swamps. 

I Strong government forces until 
late this afternoon were subject- 
I ing barrio Gabur and its outskirts 
j to light mortar and machinegun 
' fire. The strategy was to burn 
the tall talahib grass and thus 
drive the Huks into the open. 

The dissident groups under De 
j Leon were believed to have been 
I increased by Huks who had es- 
caped from their mountain lairs 
as a result of the strong consta- 
1 bulary attack shortly after the 
j ambuscade of Mrs. Aurora A. Que- 
I 2on and her party. 

! The biggest Huk-PC battle was 
expected to break out tonight or 
tomorrow with Col. Valeriano dis- 
patching more reinforcements to 
the field.

CABANATUAN, Nueva Ecija, 
May 9— Nueva Ecija Hukbalahaps 
and their satellites were becom- 
ing more reckless as governnient 
forces intensified their anti-dissi- 
dent drive in an effort to crush 
both the Huk and the PKM organ- 
izations for the immediate resto- 
ration of peace and order through- 
out the country. 

Lt. Col. Napoleon Valeriano, 
new over-all commander of Nueva 
Ecija, had been emjdoying the 
most effective tactics in pursuing 
the outlaws ever since he assumed 
his post. At the same time intel- 
ligent officers have been closing 
in on the heels of suspected PKM 
members and other persons be- 
lieved to be aiding the Huks. 

Six alleged PKM members 
were charged with rebellion in an 
information filed this morning by 
Fiscal Emilio Cecilio with the local 
court of first instance. 

Charged were Crisanto de Leon, 
• Pedro Estanislao, Inigo Atendido, 
Alfredo Rivera, Pedro Martin and 
! Inocencio Valdez, all residents of 
barrio Sicsican, 'Talavera. 

The accused admitted their 
membership in the PKM organiza- 
tion when investigated by a group 
of PC intelligence officers headed 
by Lt. Fidel Amente. They ad- 
mitted also that since last year 
they had been supporting the 
Huks under Commanders Melen- 
cio, Tagumpay and Cruzet Logo, 
all operating on the northwestern 
side of this province.

Social Reform 

Here is a decisive and broad- 
gauged program of social reform: 
Foster the settlement of the public 
domain on a large scale: let at 

least fifty million pesos from the 
•Central Bank be loaned to actual 
homesteaders. Cut opt the red- 
tape in the acquisition of public 
land. Overhaul the tenancy law, 
which has' bean turned into a noose 
around the tenant's neck. Let the 
State buy the large * haciendas in 
Central Luzon, partly on the install- 
ment plan and partly m exchange 
for public lands,, and then let the 
government sell such estates in par- 
cels on installment to the tenants. 
Let the law determine a minimum 
wage, and provide for a swift way 
of fixing decent living Tvage, so as 
to lessen labor disputes. Graduall}' i 
build up a social security systeni I 
that will protect the population in 
case of sickness, old age, accident, 
unemployment,^ and orphanhood. 

The Central Bank 

The Central Bank will finance 
government and private projects. 
But such financing will not. solve 
the people’s unrest unless social le- 
gislation is effected, at. once'. Why 
establish factories that will pa 3 V 
starvation wages? It is thus possi-| 
ble that, through the Central, Bank ' 
the business barons maj’' continue 
to exploit, the masses, and on a big- 
ger scale at that, thanks to the gov- 
ernment’s assistance. 

The Muted Voice 

President Quezon’s muted voice 
can be heard in the quietude of 
the national conscience. Let us 
hope that it may stir up our law- 
makers, of all parties, to’quick and 
constructive action. Though the 
persua.sivp accents of his eloquence 
have been stilled, there i.q a .so- 
lemn force in that silence of the de- 
parted leader. /

Here is her story: 

She was in company with her 
husband and Cpl. Eugenio Arreola 
of the 94th PC company. They

Mt. Guiniat was finally yield- 


bangan on April 30. Arreola was outlaws. No data on 

killed by the Huks who relieved all are available, however. 


About 60 huts used as barracks 
were found in the area and 
The outlaws then took Delag burned by the constabulary, 
along. She pleaded to them to let Documents left by the Huks 
her husband go, and clung to him showed that the place had been 
all along the way from the scene used as training camp for Huk

along. 

She was with the Huks march- 
ing day and night in an effort to 
evade government troops who had 
j started the search for the attack- 
■ ers of the Quezon party. 

She declared that in one of 
their conversations she overheard 
the outlaws talk about how they 
divided the spoils of the aml^ush 
attack on the Quezons. 

There was some talk about a 
certain Luningning getting Mrs. 

Quezon’s ring and one, Kulafu, 
getting Maj. Gen. Rafael Jalan- 
doni’s signet ring. 

She heard that Luningning and 
Kulafu left the gang later and 
sneaked through the PC cordon 
encircling Mt. Guiniat. 

The widow also revealed the 
hardships suffered by the outlaws 
in the punitive campaign. She 
said .she saw 20 Huks killed when 
an artillery barrage levelled down 
26 Huk barracks at Mt. Guiniat. 

She saw outlaw casualties buried 
with military ceremonies In Ba- 
sang Hamog but that many of the 
Huk dead were left behind covered 
, with cogon grass as the outlaws 
were unable to take them along 
because of the rapid advance of 
PC forces towards, the Huk posi- 
■ tions. 

She said wounded Huks were 
brought to an undisclosed hospital 
atop Mt. Guiniat. 

When the pursuit was getting 
hotter and the outlaws presumab- 
ly could not afford to allow the 
captives to slow down their speed, 
the widow was released last Sun- ! 
day night at sitio Basang Hamog.

never to marry a soldier again.

Pays Tribute To Mrs. Quezon 


While “everyone feels the poorer 
because of her death," yet ’‘our 
people and our prosperity will be 
the richer because she has lived," 
President Quirino said in his nec- 
rological speech during the memo- 
rial services in honor of Doha Au- 
rora A. Quezon given by the Phil- 
ippines National Red Cross at Ma- 
lacahan last night. 

Former Associate Justice Manuel 
Lim was another speaker at the 
gathering that was well attended. 

The President said in part: 

“Mrs. Quezon, devoted and at- 
tached to her husband as she had 
always been all her life, human 
enough to feel the immeasurable 
loss for her beloved husband’s 
demise, summoned all the courage 
and wisdom that she could muster 
from her heritage and determined 
to continue her husband’s life 
struggles while she lived. It was 
she who had seiwed as the lever 
that had gauged the course of her 
husband’s public life. She had sta- 
bilized and steadied his movements 
and convictions as he had embark- 
ed upon his aggressive and com- 
pelling patriotic endeavors at the 
height of his strength, power and 
influence as leader of his people. 
The husband’s vicissitudes of for- 
tune in his great battles of life 
had made him turn his eyes upon 
the lot of the common man. But 
it was she who had touched and 
softened his heart and made him 
champion the cause of the masses, 
the underprivileged, the underfed. 
President Quezon’s social justices 
had been Aurora Quezon’s inspira- 
tion and passion. 

“But great as her influence had 
been, she had never abused it to 
further a justifiable personal pride 
when she knew that grave pro- 
blems of state were involved. She 
had asked nothing for herself. She 
had never suggested that she 
would be sharing the criticism or 
glorification of her husband’s con- 
duct even if it affected her feel- 
ings or dignity as the mother of his 
childi’en. Nor had she minded be- 
ing dragged along up or down as 
her husband’s career had brought 
him higher or lower in the nation- 
al estimation. She had always 
risen to the occasion in the most 
helpful spirit. Because iar and 
above her realization of some of 
her husband’s failings in his hu- 
man adventures, she had had ab- 
solute confidence in her husband’s 
devotion and respect for her, 
which she undoubtedly had in- 
spired by her conduct and her 


prayers. Quezon, the great man 
and leader, became the greater be- 
cause of the inspiring influence 
of Mrs. Quezon, the woman and 
wife. And Mrs. Quezon eventually 
became the rock of refuge and of 
strength to many a Filipino lead- 
er beset with the burden of the 
people’s problems. That she did 
all this quietly within the private 
sanctuary of the home is a grate- 
ful fact and commentary on the 
womanhood of this country. 


“Aurora Aragon Quezon was not 
only the first of the First Ladies 
of the land. In her own right, she 
was simply grand ! The insuperable 
dignity, wisdom and grace with 
which she carried her responsibi- 
lity to the nation after the death 
of President Quezon were no ac- 
cident; they came as the nature 
flowering of a lifetime of respon- 
sible, devoted and fulfilled com- 
radeship. When she undertook to 
head our National Red Cross, she 
simply acceded to giving formal 
confirmation, on her own right, of 
being in fact and in truth, mother 
to her people. She did not merely 
lend her name, great as it was, 
to the cause. She labored mightily, 
doing yeoman service like every- 
one else who belonged to it, and 
provided its deepest, mast abiding 
inspiration. Our people may not 
know now who was the greater, 
Quezon the Father of his country, 
or Aurora Aragon Quezon, the tru- 
ly symbolic mother of her race. 
But history will record them both 
as the greatest benefactors of this 
generation^ and Mrs. Quezon an 
the greatest woman in her coun- 
try. 

“The world has shared our peo- 
ple’s sorrow in her tragic passing. 
Those of us who knew her well can 
most truly sa/: to know hei;^ was 
to respect her, to admire her, to 
love her. No longer shall she ^ace 
the halls of the land which were 
wont to be exalted by her en- 
nobling personality; no longer 
shall welfare institutions feel the 
touch of her kind heart and hand. 
No longer shall these Palace halls 
be dignified by her handsome and 
queenly figure; no .longer shall 
these walls receive the impact of 
her gentle influence. No longer 
shall this atmosphere, which for 
many years she had enlivened with 
her wisdom and charm, be per- 
meated by her spi^f-of racial 
honor and pride — as'' nbodiment 
of the noblest type^^f Filipino 
womanhood."

, The gathering wa^ addressed by 
Minister Bernabe Africa, chief of 
the Philippine mission in Japan. 
He said “we are gathered here 
this afternoon to pay homage to 
the memory of Mrs. Aurora Ara- 
gon Quezon, wife of the late Pres- 
ident Manuel L. Quezon, and her 
daughter Maria Aurora who, toge- 
ther with 10 others, were slaift in 
an ambuscade in morning of 
April 28, 1949 by heavily armed 
bandits while she was on her way 
to her hative town of Baler in 
Quezon province to unveil a mark- 
er designating the spot where her 
distinguished husband was born. 

“The country was shocked by

As American Editors See Us 

— REPRINTED EDITORIAL — 


The shocking 
XTLIPINO murder of the 

AMBUSH widow and daugh- 

ter of the first 
President of the Philippines and a 
group of prominent E’ilipinos by 
unidentified “bandits” was a sense- 
less act. Most western readers 
will assume a political motivation 
for the attack, especially in view 
of immediate newspaper attempts 
to link the attackers with the 
Communist-tinged, outlawed peas- 
ant organization know^i as Huk^ 
balahaps. 

However, it would be a mistake 
to put the incident into the frame- 
work of w'orldwide ideological 
conflict without concrete and con- 
’ vdneing proof. President Elpidio 
; Quirino at once stated that he 
4 thought the killers were simply 
‘ bandits, not “Huks.” Or they may 
have been a little of both at the 
same time, as some of the “guer- 
rillas” during the war were as 
much old-fashioned brigands and 
desperadoes as they w'erc heroes 
and resistance fighters. 

The tradition of banditry is 
; strong in most countries of the 
; East, w'here a poverty-stricken ‘ 
‘ peasantry faces minimal conditions ' 
; of life. The Philippines is making 
iprogi’ess in ameliorating the lot 
of the peasant, and has made even 


better progress in promoting re- 
spect for law and order. But the 
wartime resistance movement, 
which put a premium on lawless- 
ness for patriotic ends, and the 
attendant disorganization of civil 
life resulted in an unfortunate re- 
vival of brigandage and terrorism, 
which has not yet been completely 
eliminated. ! 

In such cases, motives are sel- 
dom purely “political,” as the term 
is understood in the West. To 
think of irresponsible gangs to , 
malcontents in terms of a tightly 
knit, Moscow-directed party is to 
be very naive. Disbanded and dis- 
possessed Huks are more likely to 
find their philosophy in their 
markmanship than in Marx. —

! Dr. Poling Blames Reds For Quezon 
Massacre In Report On Orient T our 


PHILADELPHIA, May 10 (AP) 
— A noted churchman reported to- 
day on his return from a six-^veek 
fact-finding tour through the 
Orient that a vast communist 
outflanking movement is being at- 
temp^ted in Asia. 

He blamed Communists for the 
killing of Mrs. Aurora Aragon 
Quezon in the Philippines. He 
said “it w^as an insphed killing.” 

Dr. Daniel A. Poling, Philadel- 
phia religious leader and news- 
paper columnist, was sent by 
President Truman’s committee on 
religion and w^eKare in the armed 
forces. 

! Speaking at a breakfast today, 
Poling said: 

“Communism is promising China 
what General MacArthur and his 
administration has given Japan — 
land and the means of earning 
a living.” He said the answer to 
communism in the Far East can 
be found in the U.S. policy of 
“patience with strength” in 


Europe. He urged a broadening 
of that policy to cover the Orient. 

Police attributed the assassina- 
tion of Mrs. Quezon, her daughter 
baby, son-in-law and many others 
to communists. 

“It is clearly evident,” said Dr. 
Poling, “that the murder of Mrs. 
Quezon was an inspired killing. 
The group’ under Luis Taruc, sup- 
remo of the Huks, has been 
seeking land. The communists 
have taken advantage' of that 
situation, in their determination 
that there shall be no amnesty. 

“I think it will be shown it 
was they who blocked the road 
before and behind when Mrs. Que- 
zon was ambushed.” 

Poling, now chaplain of the cha- 
pel of the four chaplains, said 
he narrowly missed going along 
with the Quezon party on their 
ill fated trip. He had troubled 
rearranging his schedule.

Health Resort Is Ravaged; 

Defenders Mowed Down 
By Rampaging Outlaws 

With government forces en- 
gaged in tracking down in Nueva 
Ecija the savage killers of Mrs. 

Aurora A. Quezon md her party, 
a well-armed band^of Hukbala- 
haps descended ‘on peaceful Sibul 
Springs Tuesday night and in a 
four-hour killing and~ looting 
rampage exacted a heavy toll 
in human lives and booty. 

They left in their wake eight 
murdered civilians, including two 
children, four special policemen 
killed in action, and seven wounded 
residents of the health resort. The 
outlaws carted avfay over P20,000 
in loot. Casualties among the 
Huks included a dead commander 
and four members of his murder- 
ing band. 

In Nueva Ecija, the constabula- 
ry indicted 15 people, including 
notorious Hukbalahap leaders, for 
multiple murder in connection with 
the ambush of Mrs. Quezon's par- 
ty last April 28. All the accused, 
except a captured outlaw who con- 
fessed to his participation in the 
murders, are stDl at large.

of the constabulary, and members 
of his staff who were in Pampan- 
ga yesterday, authorized yester- 
day the reactivation of civilian vo- 
lunteer units to help government 
forces stamp out the Huk menace 
in Luzon. These volunteers, how- 
ever, will be under the control of \

Aug. 19 Set 
Aside As Official 
Quezon Day 


The lower house honored the 
memory of the late President 
Manuel L. Quezon this week by 
making August 19, his birthday, 
an official holiday designated as 
I Quezon Day. 

Reps. Tomds B. Morato and For- 
tunate Suarez of Quezon province 
jointly sponsored the bill, which 
wili go to the senate for concur- 
rence. 

Two other bills also granted life 
pensions to Trinidad Rizal, only 
living sister of the Filipino hero 
and martyr, and to two living 
daughters of revolutionary Gen- 
eral Licerio Geronimo. 

Rep. Eduardo Barretto (L, La- 
guna) successfully pushed through 
his bill for a P500-monthly life 
pension for aged Dona Trining. 

Barretto declared this is a be- 
lated acknowledgment of Dona 
Trining’s invaluable revolutionary 
services. 

The Laguna solon recalled that 
Dona Trining risked her life to 
obtain gunpowder from Cavite and 
Manila, and she mixed this her- 
self for use by the “revoluciona- 
rios.’ 

She also spent her personal 
funds, he added, for those wound- 
ed in battle. 

Dona Trining was awarded two 
gold medals, one by President Qui- 
rino. and another by the Women’s 
civic assembly. 

Rep. Lorenzo Sumulong (L, Ri- 
zal) obtained passage of his bill 
giving PlOO monthly pension to 
each of General Geronimo’s im- 
poverished daughters, Concepcion 
■ and Rosalina. ' 

j The late revolutionary lieuten- 
I an'i^general, Sumulong recounted 
badly defeated the Spaniards at 
the Puray battle in the Montal- 


ban mountains. 

^ At the start of the Philippine 
revolution, he was chief of opera- 
tions for the northern provinces. 
Later, General Luna made him 
general in charge of the third bat- 
tle zone embracing Manila and 
surrounding provinces. 

It was General Geronimo whose 
army, encamped at San Mateo and 
Marikina, encircled American 
General Lawton’s forces, resulting 
in the death in battle of this fam- 
ous American officer.

Mrs. Quezon Praised At Tokyo Rites 


Visayan City 
Pays Tribute 
To Mrs. Quezon 


CEBU CITY, May 12 (Special) . 
— A fitting tribute to Mrs. Au- 
rora A. Quezon, late PNRC chair- 
man, was paid by the Cebu com- 
munity at the necrological serv- 
ices held recently at the Philip- 
pine constabulai-y recreation hall, 
this city. 


TOKYO, May 11 tUP).— Philip- 
pine Minister Bernabe Africa said 
today at memorial services for 
I Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon and 11 
others killed in the recent Nueva 
Ecija massacre that “it can be 
truly said that Mrs. Quezon lived 
and died for her country.” 

“The country was shocked by 
that awful tragedy,” Africa said. 
“In her death the nation lost a 
national leader revered by all, ir- 
respective of party or religious' af- 
filiations, for her patriotic labors 
on behalf of her people in war as 
well as in peace. 

“She It was who inspired Presi- 
dent Quezon’s lifelong stnaggle for 
independence and full nationhood 
for his country. During the enemy 
occupation of the Philippines she 
l^^ed quietly with her family in 


the United States, sharing .with 
her illustrious husband the burd- 
en of carrying on the fight until 
the enemy was driven away •from 
her native land and a democratic l 
way of life restored to the Filipino 
people. ’ ! 

“President Quezon died without | 
seeing the liberation of his coun- | 
try. Mrs. Quezon, instead of retir- 
ing to the seclusion of private life, 
was actively engaged in construe- j 
tion of her war-devastated coun- 
try ^nd in amelioration of the 
sufferings of her people, particu- 
larly the war veterans. 

“At the time for her death she 
was president of the Philippine 
Red Cross and a member of var- 
ious other welfare and charitable 
organizations.” 

The services were held in the 
army headquarters chapel center. 


Acting Governor Luis Espina 
of Cebu delivered the principal 
eulogy. Other speakers at the 
ceremony were: American Consul 
James E Henderson, Chinese 
Consul Wei-hsien Tsung, Spanish 
Consul Juan Roz Arriaza, Acting 
Mayor Arsenio Villanueva of Cebu 
City, Dr. Feliciano K. Cruz, Cebu 
PNRC administrator, and Tirso 
Uy Tengsu of the Cebu Chinese 
chamber of commerce.

by Prof. Pilar Blanco -Sala, Mrs. 
Loreto Laraquel-Victorino, Prof. 
Dolores Kapungan, Prof. Teofllo i

‘’mis LADY HAS OFTEN CHANGED 

THE COURSE OF HISTORY" 

— Bu William Thomaa Walsh 

“Her Rosary, preached by Saint Dominic, overthrov the Manichean 
heresy that would have destroyed European society. It kept both faith and 
the love of freedom alive in Eire for centuries. It won the battle of Lepan- 
lo, where Christendom was saved fi*om Moslem domination. It was under 
her special protection that Coluinhus set out to discover our western world, 
changing the uainc of his flagship fa*oin Mariagalante to Santa Maria; and 
every night, as flush came over the 'ujichartefl and terrifying waste of the 

Sargasso Sea, his sailors would assemble on the decks to sing her vesper 
hymn ; 

Iwly Queen, mother of mercy. 

Our life, our siveetness and our hope. 

Hail! 


American Catholics followed this tradition in placing their country uiuler 
lire protection of her Immaculate (.on cej)lion. And let no one imagine that 
any sort of Brave New Woihl will he able to efface her memory! For at the 
end of lime, before the consummation of this world, there will appear in 
he.ayen — or has it already appeared V — the sign foretold by Saint John 
in his Apocalypse: 

“A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feel, and on 
her head a crown of twelve stars.^' 

No one who believes in God and the im mortality of the soul should 
find it incredible that the Mother of Christ, the incarnate God, should 
have revealed herself to privileged persons at various crises in human 
affairs. Several of these appearances have been established beyond any 
reasonable doubt — notably, in modern time, the apparitions to Saint 
Bernadette at Lourdes. But why should she have appeared in Portugal in 
1 J17, and in such a deserted and inaccessible place as the Serra da Aire? 

It takes all day to get to Fatima, some ninety miles north of Lisboa first by 
train and then by bus or taxi; and when one arrives, there is not much to 
see but a vast moor with sparse vegetation for lean sheep to nibble, ami a 
few wretched villages (by American standards) where humble peasants ‘ 
scrape a bare existence out of a dry reddish soil. 

Well, first of ail she appears where it pleases God, and her ”

THE STORY OF RIE LADY OF FATIMA 

By William Thomas Walsh 

One of the strangest and most beautiful stories I 
was enacted from 1916 to 1920 in the hdl coun ry called Serra 
da Aire in the geographical center of Portugal. Three shepheru 
children’ the oldest ten, the youngest seven, reported six times m 
1917 that they had seen a Lady made wholly of light, who stood 
a small tree, spoke to them, and vanished. On the last occasion, 
the presence of 70,000 people, she performed a startling miradc to 

,f wt.,1 fh. children ..Id, T,.o of Ih. l.Bl. 
di.d m ohildhood, •• ah. l.,d forolold. T.m. h.. 

prophecies thus far: The Bolshevik Revolution, which began soon 

after; the horrors of World War 11; the rnenace that Marxism offers 
to the entire world at this moment. The Lady said that ber wishes 
were obeyed, she would convert Russia and there would be peace. 
If not, every country in the world would be scourged and enslaved. 

The third shepherd is still living. She is Sister Maria das Dores 
(Mary of the Sorrows), a lay sister of the‘ Institute of Saint Dorothy, 
just forty years of age. - 

The message she has lived to reveal is that of no ordinary La- 
dy. It comes, I am convinced, from the Queen of t^aven and earth, 
whose beauty, power and goodness have been the theme of prophets 
and saints for thousands of years. She is that maiden of whom Isa- 
ias wrote, “A virgin shall conceive and bear a son ... the one of 
whom King Solomon asked, “Who is she that cometh forth as the 
morning rising, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, terrible as an 
army set in array?” U was to her that the angel Gabriel said. Hail, 
full of grace! The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among wom- 
en!” and she replied “Henceforth all generations shall call me bless- 
ed.”

and the glorious promise of our triumph.

be a solemn pledge, reverently made by all the Catholics of the nation, 
in answer to the touching pica of the Virgin.

"BeMer Publicity 
For Pi Proposed 

The unbalanced publicity of 
♦he Philippiuea in American 
I newspapers is hurting the couu- 
try, as good 
stories about 
the country 
are seldom 
carried by 
them, said A. 

M. Macleod, 
executive vice 
preside'tit 
of Soriano 
and Company 
upon bis arri- 
val yesterday 
afternoon. 

A M. >lucleod He said 
that during 
his stay ill the United States he 
failed to read about the good 
points about the Philippines and 
the Filipinos. He said the gov- 
ernment should do something 
about it. He was away for two 
months on a combined business 
and pleasure trip and returned 
ou board a Philippine Air Lines 
])C-(5 plane from San t’raucis- 
co. 

Macleod emphasized that the 
only time one reads something 
about this country is when the 
news is bad. Items about cala- 
I hiities and violence give the 
average people in the United 
I plates the idea that there is 
r,othing here but trouble, he 
^declared. 

He pointed out that there is 
business recession in America 
today and a decline in consum- 
ers’ income. Witl\ the coining 
down of prices, there has been 
a certain ajnount of unemploy- 
ment. 

Jose Zaide of the Philippine 
Consulate in San Francisco, on 
the other hand, disclosed that 
tliere is at present a growing 
interest among Filipiuos in the 
West Coast in the national af- 
fairs of the Philippines. 

He disclosed that there are 
now 14 newspaners published 
by Filipinos in the Pacific 
Coast. Where they used to play 
up scandals and other harmful 
news about the country before, 
Zaide said the papers have 
changed their editorial policy 
beginning this year, using only 
stories which are favorable to , 
the country and the Filipinos. 

Touching on the brutal slay- 
ing of Mrs. Aurora Quezon, 
Zaide said that immediately 
after the news vras broadcast 
and carried by the papers, the 
p vailin." sentir^'^nt was one of j 
indi.gnation. r

Edited bv VIRTUDES GUINTO GALLEGOS 

‘Washing:ton D.G. 

May 6, 1949 



XJgh! for this balmy Washins:- 
ton weather. Now I know why 
the weather is such a favorite 
topic of conversation. Two flays 
ago it was cold and rainy. Then 
yesterday and today the tem- 
perature zoomed up to seventy- 
five and ninety as predicted .by 
the ~ weather-man. Never know 
what clothes to put on. And 
with this awful heat comes the 
terribly disturbing spring fever 
for aged people like me — hay 
fever they call it. It is com- 
posed of a splitting headache 
Which no amount of aspirin or 
migrain tablets can do away 
with, plus continuous sneezing, 
but no cold. So you just feel 
like crawling into a wee bit of 
a corner and die. You just have 
to wait until that feeling pas- 
ses, that’s all. I can see that 
what they say about catching 
fever generally after your sec- 
ond year in .Washington, is true. 

Last Tuesday was the Re- 
quiem Mass given officially by 
our Embassy for Dona Aurora, 
at St. Matthew’s. This was the 
same cathedral where the body 
of her late husband President 
Quezon ^lay while Mass^ was be- 
ing said in his honor five years 
ago. And we could see that 
Father Ortiz who preached the 
sermon and v/ho was the Quezon 
family chaplain all throughout 
the war, was visibly moved by 
her death. A lot of friend.s of 
the Filipinos were there. Arch- 
bishop O' Boyle was present. 
Ambassador Cowen came in 
striped pants and black morn- 
ing coat. The very popular 
O'Neal family came in early. I 
sat with Louise McNutt who 
told me her parents were then 
in Manila. The Richard Ely s, 
Weldon Jones and his wife, and 
, the Wayne Coy s were around. 

' And a lot of Congressmen and 
Senators, who knew the^ Que- 
zons were present. You’d be 
amazed at the very great num- 
ber of admirers Doha Aurom 
had in this country. At the 
various embassies I’ve gone to, 
they ask mef about the tragedy. 
And even people who don’t know 
the family personally, feel very 
deeply for N:ni and Nonong. 

So you want to be a diplo- 
mat’s wife! Well one thing 
you should do before coming 
over is to practice the art of 
niggling. For many a time at 
cocktail and tea parties, you get 
into ibe funiiest prjiaicament. 
A ve w nice person is introduced 
to you and naturally extends 
her hands to shake yours. If 
: dining wm 

you ar- lit ...V. ( 

na;'taki i^r ox you. tt-a 


chatting around, there Is where 
your problem begins. For with 
a bag dangling over one arm, 
the indispensable pair of glQVcs 
held in hand, the cup and sau-^ 
cer, plus the sandwiches and 
the cookies which your ever at- 
tentive hostess insists you help 
yourself with, you just find it 
hopeless to stretch out an empty 
right hand. So you have the 
choice of eating your whole 
sandwich, in which case it would 
be impolite to talk, or plopping 
the sandwich into your half- 
empty tea cup which I am told 
is immensely rude, or simply 
ignoring the other person’s out- 
stretched hand and apologizing 
lamely. Ho-hum for the com- 
plicated rules of etiquette. One 
pratically has to be an octopus 
I think. 

Yesterday I found myself in 
the sorry predicament of having 
to attend two “must” engage- 
ments, The first was an early 
twelve o’clock luncheon in honor 
of a very dear Dominican friend 
who was leaving for home, and 
I had accepted the invitation 
more than a week ago. And 
the other w’as a luncheon invi- 
tation for one o’clock given by 
Scuora Maria de Martinez Var- 
gas, the Bolivian Ambassadress. 
Xnd by rules of protocol an Em- 
bassy invitation especially an 
intimate one like this where 
the only guests were Bolivian 
Embassy wives and a foreigner 
who was myself were asked, 
should come first. For once I 
really appreciated the marked 
punctuality of the twelve o’clock 
luncheon. For I dashed like 
mad from one place to the other 
and made it just in the nick of 
time. Thank goodness the Boli- 
vians take their time like we *lo. 

And if I told you how we 
whiled away the time after 
lunch, would you believe me? 
The enormous living room of 
the lovely Bolivian Embassy 
was cluttered with head blocks 
and ironing boards. For while 
we chatted and enjoyed each 
other’s company, eight busy 
pairs of hands were sawing 
away and creating hats. You 
can’t imagine how entertaining 
it lb to make our own hats, or 
to re-do old ones. And to mold 
and fo’.m that Philippine buntal 
straw was a chore the ladies were 
eage . rcr. J5o Mrs. A hello who 
doesn’t know' it yet, will have 
the honor of wearing a hat 
fashioned personally by the Bo- 
' livian Ambassador’s wife.

, Signal Warning 

The murder of Mrs. Aurora Que- 
zon together with some of those 
in her company is an iiTeparanle 
national lo.s.s. "it serves a signal 
warning lo the government that 
there is much yet to be expected 
in the present campaign for peace 
and order. 

As a result of this most heinous 
crime, the people have arrived at 
a conclusion that the links are not 
e.sseniially fighting for reforms but 
also on depredating innocent and 
patriotic people. In view of this, 
all law-abiding citizen.s, casting 
aside political prejudice.s, must 
rally behind the move to w’ijie out 
'di.sorder and gang.stertsm. 

qNie government forces, in spite 
for the huge outlay for peace and 
order, cannot be depended upon 
entirely to succeed in its objective 
of maintaining peace and order 
throughout the country without 
'the civilians offering their much 
‘needed help. The latter are alwaA's 
jin' a better position to identify the 
had element.s of the community 
• and they can do a lot of hel]) by, 
jpoi-nUng" out to the pri^per author-1 
jilie.s the pen-sons or whereabouts! 
of the evil forces. It is therefore 
I incumbent upon us aU,‘ peace- 
loving and law-abiding ciU'/ens of 
this voung Republic, to unite as 
one in the crusade against disorder 
and gangster??!!!! throughout the 

country.— ’rn'<> C. R.AMIRRZ. Jr„

Noting a strong ti-adition of 
banditry in most Far Eastern 
countries, the Monitor warned: 
“To think of irresponsible gangs 
of malcontents in terms of a 
tightly knit, Moscow-directed 
party is to be very naive. Dis- 
banded and dispossessed Huks 
are more likely to find their 
losophy in their marksmanship | 
than in Marx.” | 

The reports from Manila log- 
ically suggested to the Star that, 
the assassins were members of the 
Huk movement, which is directed 
by communist Luis Taruc. “It is 
^ therefore not necessary to con- 
I elude that the order for the am- 
j bush was explicitly given by Ta- 
I rue himself.” the Star said. “But 
I its aim was in line with the Huk 
policy of violence and terrorism... 
Perhaps the revulsion of public 
opinion against this wanton kill- 
ing .. . will enable the government 
to deal more decisively with this 
endemic threat to the nation s 
peace and stability.”

Justice Lim Prefers 
Serving PI Red Croii 
To Entering Politics 

The responsibility that rests on bis shoulders as acting ohak* 
man of tho Philippine National Rod Cross, following the deatii of 
Mrs Aurora Quezon, mfikcs it impossible for him to enter polibics^ 
Justice Manuel Lim said in hia letter to tho Chronicle the other 


day. 


By JAMES G. WINGO 

Evening News Correspondent 

In the same Washington cathe- 
dral St. Matthew’s, where requiem 
high mass had been held previ- 
ously for two Philippine Pres- 
idents since 1944, the Rev. Pacifico 
A. Ortiz, S.J., wartime personal 

chaplain to Manuel Quezon, del- j ^as explicitly given 

ivered a stirring eulogy to the 1 himself.” the Star said 
widow of the first President of the i aim was in line with tl 
Philippine Commonwealth. The 
eloquent youthful Father Ortiz 
had come down from Fordham 
university in New York to blame 
all Filipinos for Mrs. Quezon’s 
death. To hipi she was “the vic- 
tim of our senseless strifes, our 
petty rivalries, our selfish ambi- 
tions.” , ^ ^ 1 . ' 

At the same time, through the 
very poor acoustics of the cathe- | 
di’al. a soft but sharp slap at the 
Philippine government ^ ^ 

heard. “Respect for government 
can not be 'given,” said the Je- 
suit. ‘'It must be earned. And 
the price is justice.” 

In belated editorials on the 
Philippine tragedy, the Christian 
Science Monitor (Boston) and the 
Washington Star played up the 
Hukbalahap angle. The Moni^r , 
saw no political motivation m the 
• senseless kUling of Mrs. Quezon 
S and others and said it would be a 
i mistake "to put the incident into

Mount Guinlat, a low mountain 
peak northwest of RIzal with 
fertile valleys around Iti base, 
was claimed by Sibayan as the 
main stronghold of Col. de Leon, 
overall Huk commander In this 
province. Here, around 1,000 
Huks, including 30 women, were 
leading normal lives until the 
Quezon massacre occurred. 

Around 70 serai-permanent 
barracks were being used bv 
the Huks which were equiped 
with the facilities of average 
homes in the lowlands. They 
even had several radio sets for 
recreational and Intelligence 
purposes. 

The small valleys around the 
base were being cultivated “cai- 
ngin" style for secondary crops 
and tubers. Sibayan revealed 
Col. de Leon had also made plans 
for planting the early rarities of 
palay this coming rainy season. 
Wide areas near the top of 
I the Mount were cleared for dril- 
ling purposes and as play- 
grounds. Col. de Leon always

rigid training of the Huks in

two weeks ago supported Siba-

huts were found atop the strong- 
hold, including the drilling 
grounds and the areas planted

base.

The remnants of their former

bayan to be escaping towards 
Cagayan Valley, together with 
the main bulk of the remaining

tola me to pray that God should keep 
and bless us all. 

I was very deeply moved because I 
suddtenly remembered my mother in 
Manila; it was just exactly what she 
would have told me and my mind gave 
a start of recognition, made a brief but 
tender identification between my mo- 
ther and this pious lady quietly read- 
^ ing the life of a saint. 

gajjjy — she hated to be called Baby 
—was the child of her father, whom she 
adored. I have often thought that he 
never married because she never did 
find anyone who could measure up to 
that vivid and gallant genius. She was 
quarreling with him at that time- She 
wanted to go to the front. 

Baby hated hypocrisy and histrionics 
and she meant what she said. “She 
should have been a man,” the Presi- 
dent told me. I could see he was pleas- 
ed with her. If it had been left to the 
two of them, probably he would have 
let her go and he would have gone with 
her. 

But to headquarters, it was unthink- 
able. Baby never did get to the front. 
I told her once she had a masculine 
mind. She was frank, uncompromising, 
even ruthless. If she learned anything 
from her father, it was to have a mind 
of her own and to say it out loud. 

In Bataan I shared the same tent 
with Philip Buencamino, who was lat- 
er to marry Nini Quezon. He was the 
aide of General de Jesus, the chief of 
the military intelligence section, where 
I had been assigned. I remember dis- 
tinctly that one of the first things we 
ever did was to ride out in the gen- 
eral’s command car along the east coast 
out of pure curiosity. 

The enemy’s January offensive was 
turning the USAFFE flank and all 
along the highway we met retreating 
units. Then there was nothing: only 
the open road, the dry and brittle stub- 
ble of the abandoned fields, and in the 
distance the smoke of a burning town. 
We turned back hurriedly; we had gone 
too far. 

I am afraid we never got any closer 
to the front lines. Our duties were be- 
hind the lines. We were quite close 
during the entire campaign until I was 
evacuated to the Corregidor hospital, 
and I developed a sincere admiration 
for him. He was a passionate national- 
ist who could not stomach racial dis- 
crimination and I remember him best 
in a violent quarrel with an American 
non-commissioned officer whom he 
considered insolent toward his Filipi- 
no superiors.

A perssnal memoir «n the tote Quezons by an author who knew them well. 

By IGNACIO JAVIER 


B y some coincidence I got to know 
both Doha Aurora and Baby Que- 
zon really well at about the same time, 
on Corregidor. I had met them before 
that, of course, but it was only during 
the first days of that historic siege that 
I had the privilege of more than a 
casual acquaintance. 

I was on Corregidor at the time 
awaiting an assignment from General 
Romulo and President Quezon was kind 
enough to give me a berth in his own 


tunnel. They were days of very great 
strain and tension. The enemy was 
bombing Corregidor continuously and 
the news from the front waj bad. The 
enormous burden of responsibility, to- 
gether with the dank air of the under- 
ground tunnel, made the President 
haggard and worn. 

But I never saw Doha Aurora lose 
her poise. She was a very pious Icdy, 
with a profound faith in God and His 
saints, and X daresay she found in re- 


ligion a secure refuge that even the 
whine of enemy bombs could not pene- 
trate. She had a small chapel put up 
at the end of the lateral tunnel where 
we were staying and there was Mass 
every day. 

The last time I saw her before J 
left Bataan, she was sitting serenely in 
the midst of the chatter and clatter 
of the hospital tunnel, reading the life 
of Saint Elizabeth, Queen of Hungary. 
She smiled when I .said goodbye and

QUEZONS 


14 







The Quezons 

(Continuesd from page 15) 

Nationalism was a trait of all the 
wuezons; it is the secret of their great- 
ness. There was nothing personal in the 
eeling for they themselves were ne- 
ver in a position where they might be 
subject to discrimination.- But for them 
it was a matter of principle that the 
ilipinos was just as good as anybody 
else. Even the serene and gentle Doha 
Aurora had this intense feeling for the 
dignity of the race. She insisted for 
instance on the independence of the 
Philippine Red Cross. 

That is a great part of the tragedy 
of her death, and of the deaths of Baby 
and Philip. Surely it is a bitter and 
shameful irony that they should have 
died at the hands of their own country- 
men, whom they loved so uncompro- 
misingly. 

But their death is also tragic because 
it was dealt 4o them by those who con- 
sider themselves the victims of social 
injustice. For the administration of 
Manuel Quezon as first President of 
the Commonwealth was devoted pre- 
cisely to the cause of social justice. 
There is in every man a secret and 
obscure instinct that gives him warn- 
ing of his fate, and it is possible that 
Manuel Quezon had a premonition of 
tragedy that intensified his great crus- 
ade. 

He came from the poor and he knew 
the blind rage that can blaze in the 
dry and shrivelled hearts of the dis- 
possessed. Perhaps, in the stately halls 
of Malacahan, he foresaw in a flash 
of prophecy that bend in a narrow 
road, the cruel talahib tall as a man 
the thorny forest, the somber moun- I 
tains, and then suddenly the ripping i 
slash of a machine-gun. j

do not understand about the tragedy 
of the Quezons. Was the ambush in- 
tended for them or for another? If for 
them, to what purpose? Was it to shock 
the country into remembrance that we 
are still at war, civil war? Was it to 
complete the discredit of the present 
administration? Was it pure robbery or 
indiscriminate reprisal? _ 

Luis Taruc was a frequent visitor in 
the Quezon house before he took to 
the field. He had long hours of con- 
versation with Baby» who ad:nired his 
mind and his inflexible will, so rare 
among, the men she knew. 

Taruc has denied that the Huk high 
command had any designs against the 
Quezons and has pledged the punish- 
ment of those- who may have broken 
(Please turn to the next page) 


the “iron discipline” of the Hiiks. The 
local Huk commander has, for his part, 
declared that the ambush was only an 
ordinary hold-up and that he could 

have stopped the massacre, if be could. 

One thing is sure. We can no longer 
under-estimate the emotional drive be- 
hind the peasant rebellion. Most peopie. 

when they heard of the Baler murders, 
asked themselves in sincere confusion: 
But why? How ’ could they do such a 
thing? How could they shoot down a 

lady like Doha Aurora and rob her 
lifeless corpse? She never did them any 
harm. On the contrary, she tended to 

their needs. She begged for them. She 
fought for them. How could they do it? 

People who ask this have never been, 
hunted. They have never starved .and 
shivered in hiding. They have never 
felt that the hand of every man is turn- 
ed against them. But the outcasts ol 
society, or those whom society has 
made outcasts, no longer recognize any 
duties to it. 

Humanity is their enemy. All of 
those who have homes while they lack 
a roof over their heads; who have food 
I on their tables while they must pick 
I the fruits and berries of the forest; 

I who have clothes on their backs while 
their own rags are torn in the under- 
brush; who can sleep secure while the^ 
must start with panic at the sound ol 
every twig breaking in the night — ah 
these are their enemies. 

And they watch for the time when 
they can hit back, briefly, blindly, but 
enough to soothe their wild envy and 
humbled pride; they watch the laborers 
clearing the winding road; they watch 
the bright banners of welcome waving 
in the forbidden towns: — an enemy 
comes, one of the happy and secure — 
they watch the long rich plumes of dusi 
sweeping across the gorges from the 
road — their hand is eager on the 
smooth barrel of the gun — one more 
chance to get back at them, no matter 
who, no matter if the gentle lady in 
the official car is a friend, for they 
have no friends, and so they press the 
trigger. ^

Nlni was supposed to have oc- 
cupied the bosrilal’s best room, 
thd special suite on the third 
floor — if she had had her bab^ 
sooner. This was a couple of 
weeks ago. and at that time the 
special suite received a lot of 
extra attention, v-ns . a change 
of furniture. Dr. Casas himself 
saw to the “decoration" of the 
room. On Hospital Day though, 
the special suite was occupied 
by pretty Tessle Arrastla Brias, 
Enrique Brias’ wife, and baby, 
a girl, who was born in the 
evening of Ibat day. The 12th 
was a good day for the hospi- 
tal — it received first prize as 
t.h« best among The many good 
ones we have in Manila and the 
suburbs today. The prize was a 
big cup doiratfd by Oceanic 
Commercial and of course 
everyone conne'^red with the

President Quirino sent a* beau-

VIGILANCE 


ARXEMIO MARTINEZ, 1442 Otis. Manila.— -Mrs. 
, Quezon, whose life was moulded to the highest 
Ideals of citizenship, service and character, died — 
a martyr of lawlessness — to reinforce the impellinf 
drive for peace. The historic truth: “We cannot 
save men from death but by risking it for them.'* 
comes to mind with her tragic passing: for it set 
off the powder for constructive thinking that, be- 
hind and beyond all the turning and twisting of 
intrigue is the all-important fact that the 
FUiipno people are “entitled to life, liberty, etc.” 
Constant vigilance should be the watchword of 
our legislatoi's that they may seize every opportun- 
ity each day to sow the seed for a social order which 
will give our citizens the assurance of peace and 
security in the future. They must labor to this 
end.

2 More Own Part 
In Quezon Ambush 

CABANATUAN, Nueva Ecija, 
May 21 (ENS) .—Benjamin Castil- 
lo, 22, and Antonio Reyes, 21, have : 

I been nabbed by the constabulaiyj 
1 for alleged participation in the 
ambuscade on Mrs. Quezon’s party. 
There are now three men. the first 
; being Pedro Manantan, • to fall 
into the government di’agnet since 
the punitive campaign aimed at 
! getting the killers of Mrs. Quezon 
j was launched. 

j Antonio Reyes was captured byi 
' Capt. Dominador Alo of the Istj 
' battalion combat team last Wed- 
nesday at barrio Salabusob, Bonga- 
bon. 

Reyes claimed he is not a real 
Huk, having been forced to join 
the organization and inducted in- 
'! to the ranks of Paulino Liwayway 
I Viemes on April 27. according to 
* constabulary report. The same 
I report disclosed that Reyes ad- 
mitted he was armed with a Ga- 
rand at the time of the ambus- 1 
cade of Mrs. Quezon’s party but j 
j that while he exhausted a Tvhole] 
, clip of bullets he had fired in the j 


When the Huks 'were dividing 
their loot, JReyes stated, he sneak- 
; ed away and returned to the Sala- 
busob mill where he was employed. 

» Benjamin Castillo was captured 
Thursday at barrio Macabsing, 
Rizal town. The constabulary re- 
ported that he admitted his par- 
ticipation in the ambuscade but 
claimed he was 200 yards from 
' the front lines and was unable to 
1 see what was actually happening. 

1 Castillo related how Cpl. Patri- 
! cio Delag of the 1st battalion com- 
I bat team was tortured and execut- 
: ed by the Huks in Mt. Guiniat. 

I Delag was in one of the buses ' 
i held up by Huks belonging to the 
I ambrnsh group in barrio Gambita- 
1 la, Rizal, on April 30. 

I Lt. Fidel Amante, constabulary 
j prosecutor, indicated he will take 
I steps to have Castillo and Reyes 
' included in the criminal proceed- 
ings against the ambush group. 

Amante yesterday commenced 
prosecution for robbery with 
homicide against former Santa 
Rosa Mayor Bo7iifacio Santos and 
Huk chieftains Aleman, Joaquin, 
and San Diego for participation 
in the Tabuating holdup on the 
night of April 25, where the out- 
laws killed Pvt. Alejandro Apor- 
do. 


j Santos appeared before Judge 
Cadhit for preliminary investiga- 
tion and although he claimed that 
he was forced to join the Huks he 
admitted he was holding an auto- 
matic rifle during the holdup. — V

’pidio Quhtno. Cardinal Gilroy left last night for Tokyo. 

In his short exchange of im- In his talk with newsmen, 
pre^sions with President Qai- Cardinal Gilroy said that m 


He observed that upon hia ar- | 
rival he was struck by die > 
crowded population of Manila, j 
and by the energy with which |, 
the rehabilitation program was 
being prosecuted as shown by 
the new buildings that greeted 
his eye and by the construction 
work projects that dot the city. 

He said it was depressing to 
note the destruction suffered by 
Manila, but it was encouraging 
to see signs of rehabilitation 
everywhere. 

In his call on President Qvii- 
rino, the Cardinal was accom- 
panied by the five members of 
his party: Msgr. James Free- 
man, Msgr. James Carroll, Msgr. 
Edward O’Donnell, Mr. Cronin 
and the Rev. Father H. Ken- 
nedy. Accompanying this group 
to Malacafian were Msgr. RuCl- 
no Santos, auxiliary bishop of 
Manila; Msgr. Jose Koch, head 
of the U.S. chaplain service m 
the Philippines; Justo Lopez, 
who represented the Knights 3f 
Columbus here; and members of 
the Catholic orders here. 

At Malacau..u, President Qui- 
rino told Cardinal Gilroy that 
“the newspapers of the opposi- 
tion” are publicizing his every 
movement, adding that he hopes 
! that “in the final reckoning, 
j the people will realize that I 
I am not as slow as they thought.’^ 

I He complained that it has to 
1 he people from other countries • 
and not the people of this coun- 
try who can see the improve- 
> ments made during his admims- 
! tration. He told Cardinal Gilroy 
' that he is diverting the money 
!i Intended for the new capital site 
• at Quezon city for his^ ' 

i bold economic program.” ^The 
: cardinal left Malacanan at o:30 
and proceeded to the University 
' of Santo Tomas chapel where 
he sang a te demn and deliver- 
ed am impassioned sermon on 
the gifts of God to mankind. 


~ 

rino, the Cardinal evinced great 
interest in Philippine affairs, 
especially the Quirino economic 
mobilization program and the 
social amelioration plan )f the 
fiTOvernment. He expressed con- 
ceni over the widespread des- 
truction of building.s and cliuraU- 
es in Manila, observing that dis- 
pite the heavy destruction Ma- 
nila is still a beautiful city in- 
habited by energetic peop.e. 

On the other hand, President 
Quirino apprised the primate of 
the circu ms lances under which 
he assuniod the presidency. He 
' said that he -became President 
upon the death of President 
Roxas and that he was rushing 
the administration’s program 
of economic development and so- 
cial rehabilitation to show the 
oeople that his administration 


accept communism will be like 
raconciling God with the devil. : 
In Australia, said the Cardinal, 
the people are leading a high 
standard of living and almost 
every family owns a home and 
a lot. That is why, he argued, 
communism cannot forge ahead 
in Australia. 

Regarding the Gamboa case, 
in which Sergeant Lorenzo 
Gamboa, an American citizen 
of Filipino parents, was banned 
from visiting his family in Aus- 
tralia, the Cardinal expressed 
optimism that a satisfactory so- 
' lution will be eventually arrived 
' at by both the Philippine and 
Australian governments. 

The Cardinal wa^ very much 
impressed by the “beauty and 
dignity of the Philippine Pres- 
. ident's Palace,” which he des- 
cribed as a good example of 


The Lancastrian transport 
plane bearing Cardinal Gilroy 
and his party’ landed at the Ma- 
nila International Airport at 
2:59 p.m. After the reception 
cerembnies, he went to the Arch- 
bishop’s Palace in Mandaluyong 
...here he talked to Archbishop 
Michael ODoherty over the 
phone from Bagnio, Then he 
drove to the north cemetery

which will be a sort of national

Her Noble Life And Loving Deeds Will For- 
ever Be a Stimulating Source For Inspiration and 
^Emulation, Especially To Us Women 


Our hearts are cloaked with a 
dark pall of mourning for this dis- 
tinguished and grand person whom 
everyone loved, revered and ad- 
mired. We miss her but somehow 
there is comfort in the thought 
that WT can always invoke her me- 
mory and in so doing derive inspi- 
ration from the impeccable life 
that she led while she walked 
among us. 

Tia Nene, as she was affection- 
ately called by those who were 
close t-o her. was a lady of diverse 
and v/ell-rounded accomplish- 
ments. True, she came of humble 
stock and was not privileged to ac- . 
quire a superior education, but she - 
was blessed with the divine gift | 
of a clear, natural intellect which | 
enabled her to rise to the highest |i 
intellectual levels of her time. I 


‘/Editor’s Note: We are vnhlishing this eulogy delivered by Mrs. Tri- 

ntd'd F. Legarda, vresident of the National Federation of Women's 
C'-bs of. the Philippines, at the necrological services held in honor of 
tJv fr[r Doha Aurora de Quezon, her daughter. Baby, and her son-in- 
Phillip Bueiiacamino III, at Malacahan Palace on May 19, be- 
" of many requests received at the NFWC headquarters for copies

of those who were not present at the necrological services

r by Mrs. Legardeid 


is to preserve precious new llvesj 
entrusted to us by Our Creat-or, 
must rise as one person to con- 1 
demn the dastardly deed that 
snuffed out the life of our fore- 
most woman leader and that of her 
young illustrious daughter, bril- 
liant son-in-law and the other un- 
fortunate victims who shared 
their t-errible fate. 

At the same time, we must urge 
and pray that proper precautions 
be taken so that innocent persons 
who might be caught in the cross- 
currents of reprisal will be spared.. 
For we must not only, preach but 
practice brotherly love; and if we 
are true Filipinos we cannot hate 
other Filipinos. We must love 
each other, laugh and cry toge- 
ther, work together, dream toge- 
ther so that the sum total of our^ 
pooled efforts and existence will 
redound to the everlasting glory 
and greatness of our young Re- 
public. 

Aurora, the Mother of Our 
Country, has joined our departeds 
leader, the Father of Our Coun- 
try. She who was his beautiful ins- 
piration during his life-time and 
who so bravely carried on his no- 
ble program of social justice after 
his death is now sleeping the sleep 
that knows no waking. By a 
strange twist of irony, the very 
persons for whom she and her hus- 
band labored most were the ones 
who blotted out her existence. 

The shots fired at Bongabon 
were not the first by all means, but 
they were the loudest and had the 


widest repercussions. My friends, '' 
These siiots which claimed such an 
array of precious lives should ' 
arouse us all to the unveiled threat 
of a dangerous new idea whose j 
primary objective is to destroy not . 
only established governments but! 
also leaders of thought and bul- j 
walks of democracy and civiliza-I 
tion. [ 

Aurora Quezon’s death is truly a j 
national loss. If those of us today i 
revere her, the future generations | 
of Filipinos will exalt her as one 
of the greatest benefactors of ourj 
people in her own right, for herj 
noble life and loving deeds will for- i 
ever be a stimulating source for' 
inspiration and emulation. We, ' 
her unworthy successors, can 
build no better memorial than to 
continue the work that she has 
started and to try to follow her 
worthy example.

the GIRI. scouts of the 
Pl^ippines are in the midst of 
thUr biennial convention. About 
three hundred delegates are in 
Manila from the pro\inces and, 
added to the many national exe- 
cutives, leaders and workers al- 
ready here, they make quite an 
imposing green-uniformed assem- 
blage. Focal point of all the ac- 
tivity is the Philippine Women's 
University auditorium. 

Adding a glamoicus touch to 
the outdoorish look of the regu- 
lar uniforms aire the gala green 
ternos with gold -embroidered in- 
signia worn to the many morn- 
ing, noon and night functions by 
such Girl Scout top brass as IMrs. 
Concepcion Gonzalez, Mrs. Con- 
cepcion Gil, the two Mrs. Lims 
(Emilia Q. and Pilar Hidalgo), 
Mrs. Ida Bromfield, Mrs. Trini- 
•dad F. Legarda, Mrs. Marina Var- 
gas and others. Outstanding 
note in this sea of green Ls the 
light blue uniform of Miss Mar- 
guerite Twohy, representative of 
the Girl Scouts world buieau. 

Highlights of toda>’s schcd’ole 
are the GSP aiuiiversary lunch- 
eon with Miss Tw'ohy as guest of 
honor and speaker, closing ses- 
sion of the convention, supper and 
a big campfire ceremony on the 
P^VU grounds. 

President Quirino and his 
daughter, Vicky, who is central 
committee honorary chairman, 
participated in the opening ses- 
sion of the convention yesterday 
morning. The President gave the 
gii'ls a stirring talk on equality 
with men, getting out and doing 
things, taking the lead in civic 
activities, etc. . . and made him- 
self a very popular man. Social 
events featured a luncheonf an 
afternoon reception given for the 
, delegates by Mrs. Gonzalez, na- 
tional commissioner, at the U. P. 
social hall, and a supper followed 
by sci'eening of Girl Scout films. 

Attracting many outside visit- 
ors as well as delegates are the 
extensiv'e exhibits on the second 
floor of the PWU auditorium 
building. Sent in fix)m all parts 
of the archipelago, the articles 
are mostly the work of Girl 
Scout .s and include such things 
as soap sculptui'e. models of com- 
munity planning from Capiz, dolls 
from Ilocos Sur, a dainty hand- 
kerchief aiTanged as a mantilla 
about a picture qf_ Baby Quezon 
' (from a girl in Nueva Vizcaya), 

! finger painting, hemp slipper.s . . 
fgmd we could go on and on. It’s 
I one of the most interesting dis- 
plays w'e’ve seen in a long time 
and fills several rooms. PPwATRA 
' has a table of native-made arti- 
‘ cles (these are for sale), a whole 
iroom is devoted to sports equip- 
ment and camping e.xhibits, and 
the PWU college of home econ- 
omics has a display of table set- 
tings, menus and meals, together 
w'ith nutrition charts. It's really 
w^orth climbing the several flights 
oT stairs.

SUSPECTED OF AIDING HUKS. Arrested recently and nowL 
being investigated by constabulary officers are three Cliine.se 
residents of Bongahon, Nueva Ecija, who have been pointed out 
by members of the outlaw band as among those giving aid to 
the dissidents. In above photo, taken shortly after their arrest, 
the Chinese suspects are (left to right, between PC guards) Tan 
Suy King, alias Ibing, 51; Ngo Hay, alias Cbua, 38; and Lee Hao 
Tee, alias Kiko, 38. 


3 CHINESE HELD 
FOR BACKING HUKS 

(Special to the Bulletin) ! 

CABANATUAN, Nueva Ecija, 
25.— Three Chinese mer- 
chants of Bongabong were ar- 
i rested by the constabulary tociay 
when two Huks, who had partici- 
i pated in the ambuscade of Mrs. 
Aurora A. Quezon and her party, 

; testified that these Chinese had 
I been giving monetary contrib- 
utions to Huk Col. Alexander 
Vienves, alias Stalin. 

The three Chinese were Ngo 
!Hay (alias Chua), 38; Tan Suy 
King (alias Ibing), 51, and Lee 
Hao Ty (alias Kiko), 38. 

The two Huks, who admitted 
j that they were among those 
:had ambushed Mrs. Quezon, vvere 
' nabbed by government operatives 
of the Nenita unit while spying 
I around the PC barracks at Bong- 
■ abong. They— gave their names 

as Vicente Marquez, 27, and Fe- 
derico Catchuela, 21, botluundcr 
Commanoer Alipio Suboi^ of 
Huk squadron Tagumpay. 

The two dissidents said the 
three Chinese merchants had con- 
tributed regularly to the funds 
of Col. Viernes, who headed and 
planned the April 28 ambuscade. 
They indicated also that it was 
possible these three Chinese knew 
of the ambush plans which had 
been plotted and studied many 
days in advance. 

Besides admitting their parti- 
I cipation in the Quezon ambus- 
1 cade, Marquez and Catchuela con - 1 
■ fessed that they took part in the 
killing of Capt. Marcos Abad of 
the 103rd .guerrilla unit some- 
time in 194G. 

They said that during the am- 
nesty period, they both registered 
as members of the PKM organ- 
ization, but rejoined their com- 
rades in the hills immediately aft- 
erwards. 

The Chinese businessmen were 
under close questioning by intelli- 
gence officers of the constabulary, 
No announcements were made.

had just been to the hospital tc 
sea about the mother of her

there, she saw so many people ir

MANILA BULLETIN, SATURDAY MORNING, MAY 28. 1949 



As American Editors See Us 


— REPRINTED EDITORIAL — 


The shocking 
PHILIPPINE murder of the 
LAW AND widow, daughter, 
ORDER and son-in-law 
of the Philip- 
pines' first Pres- 
ident, Manuel Quezon, in a high- 
way ambush only 88 miles from 
Manila, highlights once more the 
relative instability of the island 
republic tutored and sponsored by 
the Ignited States. 

Ten other persons were killed, 
10 more wounded, when “bandits” 

; opened up with machine-gun fire 
on a convoy of notables protected 
■ by a Constabulary escort. Mrs. 
Quezon was on a mission of no 
! greater political importance than 
to unveil a monument to her late 
husband. She was a leader of 
the women's suffrage movement, 
but not a political power herself, 
and was more noted for her Red 
Cross chairmanship and her char- 
itable activities than for political 


activity. It therefore seems like- 
ly, as President Quirino believes, 
that banditry and not political 
murder was responsible for her 
death. 

It is true, however, that the 
ambuscade occurred in territory 
frequented by the Hukbalahaps, 
the wartime guerrillas who since 
1945, under Communist leader- 
ship, have refused to surrender 
their Japanese and American 
arms to the government. They 
have clashed repeatedly with the 
Philippine Constabulary, and 
their leader, the gentle-voiced 
Luis Taruc, who long denied his 
Communism but finally professed 
A openly, is still at large. One 
of the members of the Quezon 
convoy was Maj. Gen. Rafael Ja- 
landoni, former Filipino chi T of 
staff. He escaped with his life, 
but it could be that one of their 
old military foes was the real 
target of a Huk attack, and that 


the Quezon family murders were j 
incidental. | 

Rebels or bandits, the attackers i 
proved again that law and order 
are not among the legacies we | 
left the Filipinos when they ran i 
up their own flag on July 4, 1 
1946. The Huks are only part* 
of the story. Other peasant 
groups, retaining their war-given 
arms or buying more from i^er- 
ican G. I’s, have found that I 
“living by the rifle” was more re- j 
munerative than toiling in the I 
rice fields- And the government 
has had another thorn in its side 
from the willingness of some Fi- 
lipinos to rob -and murder Amer- 
ican sailors and soldiers in the j 
vicinity of our Philippine bases, 
not a very democratic way, to I 
say the least, of registering pol- 
itical protest. 

It may be that we were not 
very good teachers, after all, dur- 
ing our 50 years in the islands. — 
Lo:meville (Ky.) Courier- Journal,

Fr»tdoin Spe^fci 


The mornissg after the Pres- 
idlcntial elections in December, 
1941, I found myseH on ibe 
ivay to Malacahan, summoned 
to breakfast by. the man 
whom the people had just re- 
tained in power by an ove,*’ 
whelming vole. Baby met rce 
at the PaUca and accompa- 
nied me on a launch across 
the river to the bahay kubo. 

*‘Daddy beard your speech 
on the air two nights ago” Ba- 
by said, **So he told me to get 
you out of bed early this 
morning so he could tell you 
what he thought of it.” 

“Did he like it?*' 1 asked, 

“You'll find out in a mo- 
ment” she laughed as we 
went up the house. 

Manuel Quezon was in rid- 
ing pants and his nose moved 
in the proverbial twitch as 
he told me “Raul, I want to 
tell you that what you said 
about me the other night is 
the thing I’d like best to hear 
anyone say of mo”. 

We sat down to breakfast, 
the President, Dona Aurora, 
Baby, Nini, No^nong and Mary 
Angara and myself. Manuel 
Quezon was a heavy break- 
fast eater. And he went 
through that one with verve, 
punctuating spoonfuls with 
observations on the election 
results. At one point he made 
reference with almost childish 
glee to the fact that in some 
Visayan bastions he had ob- 
tained more votes than his 
running mate, Visayan Vice- 
President Osmeha. At length 
Jorge Vargas came in with a 
pile of telegrams, and, stand-

breakfast, began to read them 
off. 

What had I said about Que- 
zon the night before the elec- 
tion? It had been a final ra- 
dio rally and among the other 
speakers was Jose Yulo. AH 1 
had said was that 1 liked Ma- 
nuel Quezon because he could 
stand up, forehead high, and 
say to the stranger from a 
foreign shore “I am a Filipi- 
no”, a thing which not many 
could do those days without 
sufficient practice, or a pre- 
vious shot of whiskey. 


MANILA, PHILIPPINES, SATURDAY 28 MAY 194» 


That is how issues went 
those days. *ManueI Quezon 
dominated the scene and those 
who would speak of him as 
against other men exhausted 
the range of his virtues with- 
out having to go into funda- 
mental issues. He was simply 



THE man and there was no 
use discussing it. . And he 


himself was never concerned 
about hew many votes he 
would get over the next op- 
ponnent. He was more bother- 
ed about how many votes he 
would get over his running 
matel 

Manuel Quezon is gone and 
with him went the era of the 
one-man show. Most people 
received the change with re- 
gret, a few with relief. Now 
w© are back to aharper propo- 
sitions like cleac government 
and social justice — and the 
men scrambling for power all^ 
swear that they ar© for all 
these things. 

The test in the present dis- 
pute for supremacy is not the 
party platform but tbe moral- 
ity of the men who would pro- 
pose to carry it out. Among 
the members of each group 
are a sprinkling of honest 
men who could truly imple- 
ment a platform of clean gov- 
ernment and social justice. 
Let us hop© and pray that 
they may come out and among 
themselves organize and pur- 
sue the course that Manuel 
Quezon was able to chart alone 
with his indomitable pcre.on- 
ality — a government for the 
people and new deal for the 
common man.

Shifted To June 25-26 

The Red Cross convention was 
postponed to June 25-26 by the 
j executive committee of the PNRC 
board of governors in a special 
meeting held yesterday at the 
[PNRC headquarters. 

The PNRC convention, which 
was formerly set on June 11-12 
had to be postponed due to a po- 
litical party meeting which falls 
on the same date and which con- 
flicts with Red Cross plans, it 
was announced by Dr. Manuel Lim, 
acting PNRC chairman. 

One of the important aspects to 
be taken up in the forthcoming 
convention will be the election 
of the successor of Mrs. Au- 
rora A. Quezon, late PNRC 
chairman, and two-thirds of the 
1 elective members of the PNRC 
board of governors. Seventy- two 
delegates elected by chapters from 
i all over the Philippines, all promi- 
i nent in Red Cross volunteer parti- 
cipation, are among the 200 dele- 
I gates and guests expected to at- 
tend the convention. Expected to ‘ 
arrive in Manila a day before the 
I convention, the delegates will hold 
j seminars and panel discussions in- 
tended to thoroughly analyze, and 
resultanlly improve, various ser- 
vice activities of the Red Cross.

OBLATE' PHILIPPINE MISSIONS 


Our Blessed Ladq ot Lipa 


iiT'TK Te must be cautious,” 

VV admonished His Excel- 
lency, Bishop Verzosa the 
diocese of Batangas in the Phil- 
ippine Islands. He was only sum- 
ming up the policy of the Eoman 
Catholic Church regarding the 
recognition of apparitions and 
favors from heaven. 

But to the Sisters of the Car- 
melite Monastery of Lipa City 
in Batangas, there could be no 
doubt that the gracious and lov- 
ing Queen of Heaven had once 
more bestowed the favor of Fa- 
tima upon a needy world. Our 
Lady had chosen their convent 
to repeat the message of Fatima; 
she had added a message spe- 
cially meant for the members of 
this chosen community; she had 
left rose petals scattered inside 
and outside convent walls, and 
the perfume of her roses had 
sweetened the air in the convent 
and among the multitudes who 
swiftly gathered, hoping to catch 
some of the precious petals. 

According to an account sent 
out by the Prioress of the Car- 
melite Monastery of Lipa City, 
Our Lady’s visits began on Sun- 
day, September 12, 1948, the 
Feast of the Most Holy Name of 
Mary, at five o’clock in the after- 
noon. 

There was no breeze that still 
September afternoon, and a 
young Sister walked in the quiet 

52 


garden. She noticed a vine shak- 
ing. All other plants were still, 

SO she went closer to try and de- 
termine the cause of the motion. 
The gentle voice of a womap 
came to her attention, but she 
saw no one. The sweet voice 
spoke to her and told her to kiss 
the ground. Gently, the voice 
told her to eat some grass, and to 
come to this spot for fifteen con- 
secutive days to visit with her. 
Then the voice ceased speaking, 
and the Sister knew she was once 
more alone among the afternoon 
shadows; the vine was still. 

On Monday, September 13, the 
Sister again sought the garden 
sanctuary. Silently, she rever- 
ently knelt before the vine and 
began reciting the Hail Mary. 
As she spoke the words “full of 
grace,” the vine began moving as 
it had the previous day. Sud- 
denly, a lovely lady in pure 
white robes stood before her. A 
golden Rosary hung from her 
right hand, and her bare feet 
rested on clouds about two feet 
high from the ground. The 
lady’s face was too radiant and 
beautiful to describe clearly. 
She smiled down on the kneeling 
nun and asked her to come to the 
garden faithfully, whether there 
be sunshine or rain. The Sister 
addressed her as “Beautiful 
Lady” and asked who she was. 

‘T am thy Mother, my little

one,” answered the Lady, and 
she was gone as suddenly as she 
had appeared. 

On Tuesday, September 14, the 
Lady was waiting at the vine for 
the young nun with 
arms. Her request was that this 
spot be blessed on the morrow, 
at whatever time the Prioress 
wished, and she forbade the Sis- 
ter to forget the incidents ot 
these fifteen days. Blessing the 
Sister, she vanished. 

On Wednesday, September 15, 
Carmel’s Chaplain, 
lency. Bishop Alfredo Ma. Ob- 
viar, came to bless the area 
designated by the Lady. The 
Lady herself was there, visible

The Lady vanished, leaving 
rose petals scattered about the 
place where she had been stand- 
ing. At five o’clock the same day 
the Sister went back, alone, to 
what was now her favorite cor- 
ner of the world. Again the 
Lady awaited her. This time she 
requested of Carmel that a 
statue of her be placed in this 
part of the garden, and that the 
place be cleared and made into 
a place of prayer. She said to 
tell the community Sisters that 
they must believe, lest they lose 
grace. Before vanishing, she 
said, “I shall always bless the 
community, my child.” 

On September 16, the Lady 
gave her specifications regarding 
the statue of herself. She wanted 
to be described to the chaplain 
so that the statue would be the 
likeness of her as the young nun 
saw her, and she wanted the 
statue to be the size of that of 
Our Lady of Lourdes in the 
cloister. She bade the Sister tell 
the Mother Prioress to have the 
Rosary recited here every after- 
noon during these special days, 
and before disappearing, she ex- 
tended her love to her daughters 
in Lipa Carmel, saying that she 
would always be with them. 

The following days brought 
the Lady to the nun in a special 
motherly way. She advised the 
Sister to be obedient, simple, and 
humble, telling her that the two 
virtues she loves best are 
plicity and humility. One day 
the Lady asked that members of 
. the community be consecrated 
individually to her, according to 
the spirit of St. Grignon de 
Montfort. 


To the sorrow of the young 
Sister,>September 26 was the last 
day of the treasured fifteen. The 
Lady came, repeating her coun- 
sels, telling the community 
through the Sister to consecrate 
themselves to her on October 7, 
and that she would not ask big- 
ger things of them, as they were 
her “little ones.” Before disap- 
pearing for what the Sister 
thought was the last time, she 
said she would always bless the 
community morning and evening,

Rose petals fell within the

petals fell on the staircase, fol-

He was a native of County Clare

had pursued the ministry of an

After receiving his Obedience to

months; then after a short visit 
to his sister and brother in New 
York City, embarked on the S.S.

Our Fathers are now living

a roof and floor in the new

Mrs. Quezon: Spotless Victim 

DR. SALVADOR ARANETA 

"Pure and spotless must the victim be that the sacrifice may bt ac- 
ceptable." These words of Jose Rizal, naturally come to our minds in this 
hour of our national bereavement. For Dona Aurora, a victim of ouf 
fractricidal hatreds, is indeed o pure and spotless martyr. 

Divine Providence has willed to demand from our country the most 
precious life of our citizenry. Let us hope and pray, that this our 'great 
loss will serve the great purpose of opening the eyes and touching the hearts 
of all our nationals, that this fractricidal strife may be put to on end. 

Dona Aurora, will be remembered by many noble deeds, but I like to 
believe that ^ur posterity will consider that her appeal to the Nation, 
through the Catholic Hierarchy, for a month of May dedicated to our Lady 
Mediatrix of all Graces, hallowed with prayers and penances, is her spiritual 
testament to one beloved country, ond as such the most significant of her 
good deeds. 

With the sacrifice of her life In the altar of our country, her appeal 
acquired a very poignant meaning. She had tq^die a martyr of our frac- 
tricidol strifes, for us to realize that we are fqcing a great national crisis, 
which demands from all of us, more prayers, more penances, and o new way 
of life, if this our beloved country of ours is to be saved. 

Following is the lost appeal of Mrs. Quezon for peoce. It wos signed 
by mony prominent Catholic leaders. 

I ^^The undersigned Catholics, mostly residents in the Archdto- 
\ cese of Manila, have consulted the Archbishop of Manila, with the ob~ 
ject of having special devotions, prayers, and sacrifices offered by all 
our bethren during the month of May, in honor of our Blessed Mother 
I Mary, Mediatrix of All Graees, to implore her powerful intercesgien for 
i the protection of our holy religion, which is being so erxtelly perse- 
[ cuted in many countries at the present time : to beseech through her 
I pouierful intercession world peace, which is threatened at the present

with which ony orator could bring 
down the house. President Quezon, 
proud that the young should take 
so avidly to his favorite subiect, 
asked that we let him read our future 
speeches for his suggestions. 

It is 0 well known fact that Philip, 
besides being o man of talent, was 
also 0 man of character. It is easy 
to envy talent and to misunderstand 
character. There were those wno 
quickly objected to the way he did 
what he pleased." But the deliberate 
and the thinking admired him tor 
doing what he thought was right. 
Like his great father-in-law, Philip 
followed his conscience and sent the 
consequences to hell. 

This pattern of behavior dis- 
pleased a few of his social ond pro- 
fessional "equals" but met with great 
favor among those who truly counted 
in his estimation— the common men 
the people who will not fight bock 
with words- or with icy ^ 

who, if desperate, will fight back 
with bullets. 

Philip never impressed anyone 
os religious, but then Philip's ^ true 
habits were not known to )ust any- 
one"’. Philip committed sms like 
all of us, but his ever supreme con- 
cern which he would noively reveal 
to me was to confess and return to 
the state of grace. His rosary al-

he '"was moking those thoughts his 
own. 

Thirty-three days later, on his 

mother's birthday, Philip was dead, 
"riddled with the bullets of men gone 

mod because their fellowmen hod 

forgotten his fother-in-low's injunc- 
tions on social justice and because 
their fellow Christians hod forgot- 
ten Christ's message of love. 

Adiong, the youthful-looking Que- 
zon family driver, was left to live 

during the ambush, because the 
murderers, in on unexplainable 
stroke of charity, thought him too 
young to die. Rushing to the front 
cor when the ambushers hed gone, 
Adiong found Philip lying on the 

front seot, his side dripping red

blood. Philip smiled at Adiong and 
in his usual confident way said in 
clear, notural tones "Malakas pa 
Qko" — "1 om still strong". To de- 
monstrote his strength Philip said, 
"Tingnon mo"— "Look!", °ad dip- 
ping his finger in his own blood 
wrote on the boeje rest of the front 
seat the words "HOPE IN GOD . 

When they placed him on tha 
jitney for Cobonotuon, Philips 
bloody bonds were fingering his 
rosary and his porched lips were 
moving in prayer to Mory, the 
Mother of God. 

Philip was my closest friend and

Philip Bucncomino: A messoge spelled in blood 

The Sign In The Sky 

By RAUL S. MANGLAPUS 


"Good heavens, Raul, just be- 
cause Philip is dead you're not going 
to ceme cut and tell us thot he was, 
after all, just o nice, quiet, pious 
young man, the poor dear! 

That is not my story. 

Philip wos nor just a quiet, pious 
young man. His unbounded energy 
end the activities in which that 
energy found expression were not the 
usual features that one would asso- 
ciate with quiet piety. 

In college, I stood beside Philip, 
haranguing hysteric rooters m the 
frenzy of championship gomes. I 
stood beside him, disputing tor the 
school, with studied argument and 
hand-picked phrase, c debating cup 
or an oratorical medal. At war s 
inception, I stood beside him hurling 
radio invectives at the yellow invader 
and, at war's end, interviewing 
liberation personalities for our very 
own paper or broadcasting for the 
Commonwealth Government earnest 
assuronces to a dozed, uncertain 
people. 

(n the early days of the Common- 
wealth, when President Quezon 
launched his program of social jus- 
tice, it became the fashion in orato- 
rical contests to take up in flaming 
words the cause of the common 
too. Philip and I took to the sub" 
ject, which was a "natural”, and

ways jingled in his pockets, and t’-e 
bloodstained beads which were 
brought gock to Mini .lost Thursday 
tell the story of his devotion to Mary 
until death. 

Last March 26 was Philip's 29th 
birthday. At luncheon at his father's 
house in Brixton Hill, Santa Mesa, 
were Dona Aurora, Baby, Mini and 
the family. Suddenly breaking away 
from the topic of current politics, 
Philip said to me in tones that would 
have made the uninitiated jump up 
incredulously; "Raul, the Blessed 
Virgin has appeared at Lipa and has 
Q message for all of us. . What ore 
we going to do to welcome her and 
spread her message?" Philip was 
echoing the thoughts of Dona Aurora, 
who wanted a period of prayer and 
resolution to welcome the Virgin and 
spread her message of Peace; and 
he was making those thoughts his 
own. 

Thirty-three days later, on his 
mother's birthday, Philip was dead, 
riddled with the bullets of men gone 
mad because their fellowmen had 
forgotten his father-in-law's injunc- 
tions on social justice and because 
their fellow Christians had forgot- 
ten Christ's message of love. 

Adiong, the youthful-looking Que- 
zon family driver, was left to live 
during the ambush, because the 
murderers, in an unexplainable 
stroke of charity, thought him too 
young to die. Rushing to the front 
cor when the ombushers hed gone, 
Adiong found Philip lying on the 
front seot, his side dripping red 


with which any orator could bring 
down the house. President Quezon, 
proud that the young should take 
so avidly to his favorite subject, 
asked that we let him read our future 
speeches for his suggestions. 

It is o well known fact thot Philip, 
besides being o man of talent, v/os 
olso o man of character. It is easy 
to envy tolent and to misunderstand 
character. There were those who 
quickly objected to the way he "did 
what he pleased." But the deliberate 
and the thinking admired him for 
doing what he thought was right. 
Like his great father-in-law, Philip 
followed his conscience and sent the 
consequences to hell. 

This pattern of behavior dis- 
pleased a few of his social and pro- 
fessional "equals" but met with great 
favor among those who truly counted 
in his estimation — the common men, 
the people who will not fight bock 
with words or with icy stares, but 
who, if desperate, will fight bock 
with bullets. 

Philip never impressed anyone 
as religious, but then Philip's true 
habits were not known to just "any- 
one"'. Philip committed sins like 
oil of us, but his ever supreme con- 
cern which he would naively reveal 
to me was to confess and return to 
the state of grace. His rosary oi-

blood. Philip smiled at Adiong and 
in his usual confident way said in 
clear, natural tones "Molokos po 
ako" — "I om still strong". To de- 
monstrate his strength Philip said, 
"Tingnon mo" — "Look!", and dip- 
ping his finger in his oWn blood 
wrote on the bock rest of the front 
seat the words "HOPE IN GOD". 

When they placed him on th -2 
jitney for Cobonotuan, Philip's 
bloody hands were fingering his 
rosary and his parched lips were 
moving in prayer to Mary, the 
Mother of God. 

Philip was my closest friend and 
I am taking those words which he 
wrote in his own blood os the mes- 
sage which, in his agony, he hoped 
his family, his friends and his coun- 
try would take from the manner 
he ond his illustrious mother-in-law, 
his sister-in-law ond other com- 
panions perished that day. 

Long after my human memory 
shall lose the rich resonance of his 
orations and the carefree ring of his 
laughter, I shall remember the wov 
he spelled with his own blood the 
remedy to oil ills and the means 
to peace in our land. And I shall 
know the way he meant those words; 
"Hope in God, hope in His mercy 
and treat your fellow man especially 
the common man, the way God wonts 
you to treat him and the way 1 
liked to treat him — ^with love, with 
understanding, with justice . 

A simple little novice at Lipo has 
the some message to soy from the 
Mother God.
