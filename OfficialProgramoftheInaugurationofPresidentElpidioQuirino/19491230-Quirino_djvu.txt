The Philippine Republic is still young— only 
three and a half years old — but its people, repre- 
sented by the young man holding the Filipino flag, 
are ready and determined to serve, labor and 
produce in order to maintain, protect and defend 
the infant Republic.

THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL HYMN * 



★ 

Land of the morning, 
Child of the sun returning, 
With fervor burning, 

Thee do our souls adore. 
Land dear and holy, 
Cradle of noble heroes, 
Ne'er shall invaders 

Trample thy sacred shore. 

Ever within thy skies and through thy clouds 

And o'er thy hills and sea 
Do we behold the radiance, feel the throb, 

Of glorious liberty. 
Thy banner, dear to all our hearts, 

Its sun and stars alight, — 
0, never shall its shining field 

Be dimmed by tyrant's might! 

Beautiful land of love, 0 land of light, 
In thine embrace 'tis rapture to lie; 

But it is glory ever, when thou are wronged, 
For us, thy sons, to suffer and die.

" - 




LPIDIO QUIRINO, lawyer, orator, legislator, economist, diplomat and 

statesman, was born on November 15, 1890 in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, 

being the third among the nine children ot Mariano Quirino and 
Gregoria Rivera. 

Elpidio received the rudiments of education from his parents; later 
he was sent to the private school of Maestro Anastacio Aquino of 
Aringay, La Union. Subsequently, he entered the Aringay public 
school, the San Fernando provincial school, and the Vigan high school where he 
completed his first year. He also enrolled in painting and drawing in the Universidad 
Ilocana. In April, 1908, he came to Manila to attend the Manila High School, 
partially supporting himself by sketching, and illustrating for a couple of publica- 
tions while an elder brother aided him. It was here that he learned his rules 
of discussion and debate, heading the Cryptia Debating Club, traditional opponent 
of the Rizal Debating Club led by Manuel Roxas. Graduating in April, 1911, he 
enrolled in the College of Law, University of the Philippines, where he obtained 
his Bachelor of Laws in March, 1915. He passed the bar examination in the same 
year; was admitted to practice in the United States District Court of China in 1921, 
and to the Federal Supreme Court in 1934. 

While a student in Vigan, he accepted a teaching position in one of the barrio 
schools, and, later, while a student in Manila he successively became junior 
computer in the Bureau of Lands, clerk in the principal's office of the Manila 
High School, and property clerk in the Department of Police, Manila. Immediately 
after his admission to the bar he became a law clerk, Philippine Commission, and 
later in the Philippine Senate. He was Secretary to the President of the Senate, 
1917-1919, then resigned to launch his candidacy for membership in the lower 
house. He won and served as Representative from the First District of Ilocos Sur, 
1919-1922; became a delegate of the House of Representatives to the International 
Bar Conference in Peking, China, 1921; Senator from the First Senatorial District, 
1925-1931; re-elected to the Senate from the same district, 1931-1935. Then he 
became delegate to the Constitutional Convention, 1934-1935; Secretary of Finance 
under Governor-General Frank Murphy, 1934-1935; first Secretary of Finance under 
the Commonwealth Government, 1935-1936; Secretary of the Interior, 1936-1938; 
and elected Senator-at-Large in 1941. Following the liberation of the Philippines, 
he was elected President Pro iempore of the Philippine Senate in 1945. 

As a member of the Senate before the establishment of the Commonwealth 
Government, he was Chairman of the Joint Legislative Committee on Taxation; 
Senate Majority floor leader and Chairman of the Committees on Rules, Accounts, 
Elections and Privileges, and Public Instruction. He was a ranking member of the 
last Independence Mission to the United States headed by Manuel Quezon which 
secured the passage of the Tydinys-McDume Independence Law in 1934. As 
member of the Constitutional Convention, Elpidio Quirino was responsible for 
breaking the long deadlock on tAe question of whether or not the constitution 
being drafted was, also going to become the constitution of the future republic. 
He advocated that the matter be lefl to the people and the leaders of the republic. 
He also was instrumental in defeating the Singson Encarnacion proposal that the 

[PoW Eleven ] 




\ 



constitution adopt the freehold system in regard to mineral lands. As a legislator 
he sponsored the revision and codification of the scattered laws on elections, and 
of the motor vehicle laws; initiated a major revision of the laws on tariff and 
taxation; fathered the law creating the Junior College of Vigan, Ilocos Sur; 
conceived the first Land Colonization Act which became the pattern of the Com- 
monwealth Land Settlement Act; and drafted the law on national defense with the 
assistance of Colonels Ord and Eisenhower, then assistants of General MacArthur, 
While in the Cabinet, he was Chairmen of the National Information Board, the 
National Relief Board, the National Radio Board, the Board of Trustees of the Phil- 
ippine Charity Sweepstakes, and the Special Interdepartment Trade Committee. 
As Secretary of Finance, he advocated the creation of the National Loan and In- 
vestment Board and the National Economic Council, As Secretary of the Interior, 
he advocated the conversion of thickly populated and progressive barrios into 
municipalities, and of municipalities into cities. The new cities organized during 
his incumbency were Cebu, Iloilo, Zamboanga, Davao, and Bacolod. He sponsored 
the organization of the State Police and the organization of the Office of the Com- 
missioner for Mindanao and Sulu, the latter to bring the National Government 
closer to the Mohammedan Filipinos. He was responsible for the creation of the 
National Information Board for the purpose of informing the masses of the people 
about the Government and what it was doing for them and, at the same time, 
of knowing the problems of the people. As Secretary of the Interior, he adopted 
the policy of visiting the provinces and the rural communities pursuant to a policy 
of bringing the Government closer to the people, and the people closer to 1he 
Government. 

Before his return to the Senate in 1941, he was Vice Chairman of the Board 
of Directors of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank and member of the Board of 
Directors of the National Development Company and several of its subsidiaries. 
At intervals while not serving the Government in any official capacity he practiced 
law and taught in various colleges and universities in Manila. He was Dean of 
the Adamson College of Law beiore his election to the Senate in 1941. He was 
President of the Philippine Economic Association since this organization was founded 
in 1934. 

Elpidio Ouirino married Alicia Syquia, daughter of Tomas Syquia and Concep- 
cion Jimenez, on January 16, 1921, by whom five children were born: Tomas, 
Armando, Norma, Victoria, and Fe, the second, third and fifth children having been 
massacred together with their mother and other relations in the slaughter of South 
Manila in February, 1945. 

Senator Elpidio Ouirino was inducted into office as Vice President of the Phil- 
ippines on May 28, 1946. He was appointed by President Roxas first as Secretary 
of Finance and later as Secretaiy of Foreign Affairs. 

Vice President Ouirino and Minister Nathaniel P. Davis were Chairmen of the 
Joint Executive Committee tor the Inauguration of the Republic of the Philippines 
on July 4, 1946. 

He took the oath of office as President of the Philippines before Acting Chief 
Justice Ricardo Paras on April 17, 1948, succeeding the late President Manuel 
Roxas, who passed away unexpectedly while visiting the Clark Field Air Base on 
April 15, 1948. 

President Ouirino made an official visit to the United States at the invitation oi 
President Truman, leaving Manila on August 6 and returning from Washington, 
D. C, on August 18, 1949, after a most successful mission. 

He was reelected President of the Philippines on November 8, 1949 with an 
unprecedented majority.

EFelwndo JLopez 

Vice President of the Philippines 



[ Page Thirteen ] 




ERNANDO LOPEZ, son of Benito Lopez and Dona Presentacion 
Hofilena, was born in Jaro, Iloilo, on April 13, 1904. His parents 
were prominent in the political and social circles of the Visayan 
Islands. His father was at one lime Governor of the Province 
of Iloilo. 

Fernando obtained his elementary and secondary education from 
^j^iff? the Coleqio de San Juan de Letran. He later studied law in the 

University of Santo Tomas and passed the bar examination in 1925. 
After the termination of his studies, he engaged with his brother, Don Eugenio Lopez, 
in the transportation and newspaper business and later extended their business 
enterprises to air transportation. 

II is strange lhat although Fernando clearly belongs to the moneyed and 
capitalist class, he is the candidate' of labor. This is due to the fact that the 
common and working man has learned to love him because of his humanitarian 
and progressive treatment of his laborers in his varied business enterprises. Not 
a single strike has been declared in any of his business enterprises. This is 
due to his broad outlook toward labor and to the fad lhat he has shown many times 
that he would rather lose than close any losing business enterprise just to keep 
his laborers employed. No wonder, he maintains the loyalty and the love of his 
laborers and the common man. 

Before the war, he was offered many responsible and lucrative positions by 
the late President Quezon, but, because he had always shunned politics, he politely 
declined them. It was not until after the war thai he accepted the position of 
Mayor of the City of Iloilo. He did it not for the glamor of the position because 
more glamorous positions had been offered to him previously, but because he 
firmly believed that his ability and services were needed in the reconstruction and 
rehabilitation of the said City which was so badly damaged by the last war. 
His record as Mayor ot the City of Iloilo projected his person into the national 
scene. He immediately restored peace and order in Iloilo. He rehabilitated that 
beautiful City and showed his concern for the common man by donating his entire 
salary to increase the salaries of the lowly employees in the City Government. 
He gave bonuses to the teachers and to the low-salaried employees in the City 
from his own pocket even before the National Government started giving living 
bonuses to the national employees. 

In the elections of 1946, he supported President Osmena for the Presidency and, 
upon the election of President Roxas, Fernando Lopez tendered his resignation as 
Mayor of the City of Iloilo. President Roxas refused to accept his resignation 
because of the invaluable and great services which Mayor Lopez had been 
rendering. He continued as Mayor and won the admiration of President Roxas 
who called him the best city mayor the Philippines ever had. 

In 1947, he was elected Senator by the people of the entire country. He was 
among the first advocates for a clean, decent and honest government. As a 
Senator, he sponsored in the Senate measuies on labor and social security for 
the common man. 

His meteoric rise in politics is due to his ability and honesty which have 
focused the attention of the people on him as an up and coming statesman. 

He is married to Dona Mariquita Javellana with whom he has six children.

Miss Victoria Quirino 
First Lady of .he Land 



[ Page Eighteen ] 



THE FIRST LADY OF THE LAND 



ICTORIA QUIRINO, the President's daughter, was born in Manila on 
May 18, 1931. Her birth was attended by doting relatives and a few 
"fairy godmothers" who must have decreed that before the girl-child 
reached her eighteenth year she would be the youngest First Lady of 
the Land. 

Vicky, as the First Lady is affectionately called by intimates and 
most everybody else, is a normal, healthy young girl who, at seven- 
teen, has lived quite a normal, healthy young life. Destiny catapulted her into the 
extraordinary existence of combination schoolgirl — First Lady. 

Vicky went to kindergarten school at ihe age of five, attending the moppet class 
at St. Scholastica, Manila. She spent the lirsl lour grades of primary school at 
an American school. Her intermediate and high school studies were finished at 
St. Scholastica, where she graduated at the age of 16. Further regular schooling 
has been interrupted by the pleasurable but wearisome duties of being hostess at 
Malacanan and "ambassadress-at-large". Sl">e is, however, getting music lessons 
and an education of sorts from the experiences her position has brought her, and 
from private tutors. And some day, she hopes, she will be a writer. In the mean- 
time she reads avidly all the literature that appeals to a young girl, and some that 
do not appeal, for discipline's sake. She has a French teacher, because aside from 
Spanish, French is the language that intrigues her most. 

She is widely traveled. At two she saw ihe world from a bassinet when Papa 
and Mama went to the United States. At fifteen, she went clear around the world — 
Siam, Hawaii, the United States, England, Spain, Italy, France, Switzerland, Nor- 
way, Sweden, Egypt, India — then back home. She traveled in company with her 
father, then Foreign Affairs Secretary, her brother Tommy, and an ambassadorial 
entourage. 

Two years later she was to go back to Spain, only this time on her own as 
the First Lady of the Philippines, with her own retinue of chaperons, secretaries, 
aides, relatives and friends. She was feted, lionized and decorated. The trip was 
very tiring, her schedules were packed with receptions, trips, and balls; but she 
enjoyed every minute of it. 

And now she is home. Home to officiate graciously at grand state affairs. 
Home to continue her interrupted schooling, to swim, bowl, and indulge in her 
favorite outdoor sports. And her favorite indoor sport: dressed in green and white, 
rooting for the La Salle basketball quintet. 

Biographical trivia: Vicky is tall, built along athletic lines, but anatomically 
proportional. She has long, lithe legs, a vivacious face with a prominent chin, and 
an irrepressible smile. When serious, her face looks slightly bored and worried; 
when she smiles, she is the picture of a girl enjoying herself immensely, and 
rather laughing in secret, at some secret jokv. Vicky wears her clothes well. In 
sports things she is fashionable with a dash, and superbly at ease; in formal 
clothes she is a pretty picture. With her hair down, she has a piquant, young 
face; with her hair up, she is playing at being grown-up. 

She likes modern dances because she is under twenty; but she appreciates 
Bach and Beethoven because all her life good music has been part of her education.

President Sergio Osmena — 

(The Honorable Sergio Osmena took his oath ot office on August 1 1944 as 
President ot the Philippines following the death ot President Manuel L Quezon af 
baranac Lake, justice Robert H. Jackson ot the United States Supreme Court ad- 
mimstered the oath at 2:40 p. m. on that day in the office ot Secretary Harold L 
Ickes, Department ot Interior, Washington, D. C. The solemn ceremony was wit- 
nessed by olticials ot the Philippine and United States Governments and members 
ot the press.) 

After the oalh of office had been administered, President Sergio Osmena said: 

I am conscious of the tremendous responsibility that is mine as 
I assume the Presidency of the Philippines. I pledge all that is 
in me to serve the best interest of the Filipino people. My first ob- 
jective is to co-operate with the American Government, sparing 
nothing, lor the achievement of victory which means the complete 
liberation of the Philippines. Philippine relief and rehabilitation 
is one of our pressing problems. 

I have faith in America and in the American people, and as in 
the past,. I know the United States will keep faith with us. The ^ 
freedom of the Filipino people is my goal and the permanence of 
that independence once achieved I will strive to secure. 

—(From President Osmena's press statement immediately alter 
the oath-taking at Washington, D.C., August I, 1944)

* * 



The gravity of our new problems demands the collective effort of 
CW the people. The government cannot undertake to solve them 
alone. It needs the support of the people— a united people. More 
than ever before, now that the rapid advance of our forces is widen- 
ing its field of action, the government needs a united popular sup- 
m°? *° Snable . il to undertake successfully its tremendous tasks. 
Not by dissension and bickerings, not by resort to violence and law- 
lessness can we serve the national interest. It would be tragic 
indeed i at this last state of our crucial struggles for nationhood, 
we should fall apart and be divided against ourselves. We have 
had enough misfortunes and sufferings in this war; we cannot bear 
beLTddal 9S ° Urselves into the ab y ss of disunion would 

As the head of your duly constituted government, I therefore ap- 
peal to you, my people, to remain united. I urge you to forget petty 
political differences, to bury the hatreds and animosities engendered

President Manuel Roxas — 

more in this part of the world the American flag flies more trium- 
phantly today than ever before in history. Some hundreds of yards 
from- here at Fort San Antonio Abad, the American flag was first 
planted in 1898. As its brave colors fluttered down from the flag- 
staff a moment ago, the cycle of history had completed a full turn. 
In the culmination today, America justified her destiny. For Amer- 
ica, today's act of renunciation was the climax of triumph ^. . for 
enlightenment, for democratic values, for liberty. We mark here 
today the forward thrust of the frontiers of freedom. 

I have raised the Philippine flag to wave henceforth alone and 
unshadowed over the entire Philippines. American sovereignty has 
been withdrawn. It has been transferred and is now possessed in 
full measure by the Filipino people. 

We have thus reached the summit of the mighty mountain of inde- 
pendence toward which we and our fathers have striven during the 
lifetime of our people.

ident of the Republic ot the Philippines delivered at the Luneta on
