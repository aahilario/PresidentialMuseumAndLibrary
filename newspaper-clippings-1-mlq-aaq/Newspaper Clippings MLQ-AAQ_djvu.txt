Elizalde Tells Local Rotarians 
Reason For Quezon Flight To U. S t 


DAILY NEWS 


The inside story of what trans- 
pired behind the Washington 
scenes that led to the evacuation 
of the late President Manuel L. 
Quezon to American capital was 
revealed yesterday by Joaquin 
Elizalde, former Philippine resi- 
dent commissioner, in his speech 
before the Rotary Club. 

Following a series of confer- 
ences between American officials 


and him, the matter was taken 
by the Roosevelt war cabinet, Eli- 
zalde said. Friends of the Phil- 
ippines, like Paul V. McNutt and 
Frank Murphy, both of w.hom had 
served here as High Commission- 
ers, helped push through the 
plan, he added. 

Finally, Elizalde related, the 
then Secretary of War Stimson

sent a radiogram to General Mac. 
Arthur instructing him “to eva- 
luate Manuel L. Quezon, in order 
that he may head the Philippine 
government in exile in Washing, 
ton, and to be the symbol of Phil- 
ippine redemption." 

The late president, according to 
Elizalde. was instrumental in the 
seating of the Philippines among 
the other United Nations. Wield- 
ing a strong influence with Wash- 
ington authorities and counting 
\vf:h innumerable friends, the late

Elizalde Role Bared 
In Quezon Rescue 


Former Philippine Resident 
Commissioner Joaquin (Mike) 
FK-roi^, c Ue * t speaker at yes- 
terday’s luncheon of the Ma- 
nna xtotary dub, was intro- 
bv Potarv President Gil 
Fuyat quoting from U.S. Con- 
gressional ftecords as the author 
of the plan to evacuate Pres- 
ident Quezon to the U. S. when 
the fall of the Philippines be- 
came imminent in 1942. 

In his speech, Elizalde re- 
vealed that he was watching a 
football game when his name 
was called and he was told to

report immediately at the White 
House. There President Roose- 
velt told him America was at 
war with Japan. 

When Philippine conditions 
developed from bad to worse, 
Elizalde suggested to President 
Roosevelt that President Que- 
zon be evacuated from the Phil- 
ippines. President Roosevelt 
precipitately phoned Secretary 
of War Stimson for an appoint- 
ment on behalf of Elizalde. The 
cabinet, and other high Ameri- 
can officials especially those 
who had seen service in the Is- 
lands like McNutt, Murphy, 
Stimson, and Davis, all whole- 
heartedly endorsed his plan 

Elizalde added that President 
Quezon was warmly received by 
President Roosevelt personally 
and was subsequently paraded 
through one of the most thun- 
derous ovations ever accorded 
any visitor. 

Elizalde eloquently counselled 
realistic attitude in facing the 
.post-war economic problems. 
The economic problems of the 
war forced America to encour- 
age the production of materials 
in South America and other re- 
gions, which strategy now places 
Philippine trade at a disadvant- 
age. 


For instance, hemp, which 
was almost an exclusive mono- 
poly of the Philippines, is now 
grown abundantly in South 
America, Elizalde explained. 

He openly favored the Bell 
Bill and said that it would be a 
tremendous achievement for the 
sponsors if they succeed in its 
final approval. 

Paying tribute to Paul V. Mc- 
Nutt, now High Commissioner to 
the Philippines, he said McNutt 
was fully behind the bill. 

Commenting on Senator Tyd- 
ing-s, Elizalde stated that the 
American senator believed that 
the Filipinos should help them- 
selves while waiting for rehabi- 
litation aid from the U.S. This 
explains, the ex-commissioner 
said, why his bills are not what 
Filipinos expected. 

Elizalde expressed the need 
for an economic expert to repre- 
sent the Philippines in the 
United States to coordinate local 
business interests, American 
business and political interests 
in Washington. 

In closing he urged unity. 
“Only if we present a solid, 
united front, can we impress re- 
habilitation sources in Washing- 
ton,” he said. 


by statesmen of the category of 
^liord Haliifcix, the former resi- 
dent commissioner stated. It was 
also through Quezon’s efforts 
that the Islands became affiliated 
with the UNRRA and other in. 
ternational organizations, Elizal- 
de added. 

Up to his tragic death on Aug- 
ust 1, 1944, Quezon’s faith in his 
people, friends and the officials 
he left behind never wavered. Eli- 
azlde disclosed. 

Explaining the mechanics of 
Washington legislation, the former 
resident commissioner said that 
while on this end our pi’oblems 
seem to be all-important, in Wash- 
ington they form only one small 
item among the multifarious pro- 
blems the American people are 
confronted with. Viewed in this 
iigh't the passage of the Bell bill, 
which Elizalde .feels has a good 
I chance of being approved, “would 
be a tremendous achievement.” 
Elizalde concluded by making 
three recommendations, namely: 
1) Philippine business should 
send a representative to Wash- 
ington; 2) a united front must be 
presented by Philippine business- 
men; and 3) social conditions 
here must be improved bv giving 
impetus to industry. 

Referring to the last point, Eli- 
zalde, interviewed after the 
speech, explained that industry 
should give a decent living wage 
to workingmen. Social discontent 
cannot be eradicated by a system 
of dole-giving, he said, for work- 
men, to be contented, should bo 
self-respecting.

Philippines President on Arrival 

Here Slips to Hotel in Taxicab 

President Manuel Quezon of the 
Philippine Commonwealth arrived 
here by train from Washington last 
night and rode in a taxicab to the 
Hotel Park Avenue 

and Fifty-first Street, while the 
hotel’s manager with a private car 
and a police escort waited at Penn- 
sylvania Station until all three sec- 
tions of the Congressional Limited 
had pulled in before learning that 
they had missed their man in the 
crowd. 

The President’s wife, three 
daughters and a son had preceded 
him from Washington, arriving 
here Thursday night. They waited 
for him at the hotel, instead of 
joining the welcoming party of de- 
tectives, newspaper reporters and 
photographers who were disap- 
pointed at the station. 

President Quezon's young mili- 
tary aide, Lieut. Col. Jaime Velas- 
quez, explained that the President 
was sorry to have missed those 
waiting for him and had hurried to 
the hotel because he was tired and 
wished to retire early. 

Mr Quezon reached the hotel 
just five minutes after Sergio 
Osmena, vice president of the 
Philippines, had announced himself 
to a hotel management unaware 
of his impending arrival and ob- 
tained a suite adjoining the quar- 
ters occupied by the Presidential 
party.

arrived from Washington at the 
Hotel Ambassador at 8:05 p. m. yes- 
tercT^irini minutes after Vice-Pres- 
ident Sergio Osmena registered 
there and obtained a suite next to

Of Quezon 
Arrival 

! Aurea Labrador, nurse, who ac- 
i c.ompanied Manuel Quezon when he 
was evacuated from Corregidor, was 
the first person off Quezon’s pri- 
vate car when ifc arrived in the 
Asheville station.

uniforms of the city and military 
Police, gathered at the Asheville 
station for the arrival of the party 
One young woman, in a railway ex- 
press uniform, also was present to 
lend a hand. 


, Trains in the Asheville station 
j were held up to insure a clear track 
tor the Miami train bearing the 
Quezon party. Travelers at the 
BUtmore station who had been told 
tLat their train was at, the Ashe- 
ville depot became fearful that they 
had missed connections until told 
the reasons for the delay. 

! Mrs. Quezon, who appeared to be 
a little tired after the long train 
trip, wore a navy print dress with 
| a P aIe b] ue spring coat and black 
accessories, a slight woman, her 
black hair was waved into a pom- 
padour and her small black hat was : 
decorated with veiling. She was 
greeted by Mrs. C. Christian Mol- 
jler, a friend of 20 years. 

Mrs. Quezon remarked . that, 
though she had visited other sec- 
tions of the United States, this was 
her first visit to Asheville. 

| Major E. Dino, attending surgeon, 
’was particularly noted by the re- 
porters for his friendly smile. When 
questioned he stated that Quezon's 
J family also was evacuated by sub- 
marine from Corregidor, stopping 
at Negros Island and Mindanao be- 
fore continuing to Australia. Maj. 
Dino carried a curious crop-like 
cane, made of dark red plaited 
.cowhide. 

In the crowd awaiting the ar- 1

Filipino private in the American

PHILIPPINE FUTURE: Into the suite of frail, dark-eyed 

President Quezon this morning went a smiling, enthusiastic Presi- 
dent Roosevelt, anxious for a long, uninterrupted talk with the 
loyal proof that democracy is not only a way of life but a sure- 
fire way of colonizing. Until fell after 11, the two Presidents talked 
on— not of the past— but of the present, the bright future when 
the Filipinos are once more in possession of their islands, their 


i own souls. 

BREADBASKET: Waiting pa- 
tiently when the President got

: both with the national bread- 
| basket on their minds.

cepted from a delegation of the 
Jewish section of the Interfaith 
t Committee for Aid to the Democ- 
racies a scroll in tribute to the 
memory of his mother, bearing

! TO THE PHILIPPINES * . . : 


Around the 4 great table in the 
White House dining hall at noon 
gathered the Cabinet members, 
their wives and the nation's top 
wartime chieftains in honor of 
Philippine President Quezon, his 
family and his government. 

“A”: The White House got a 
couple of “A’s” today. One was 
for turning out a surprising 
amount of paper work, including 
a message to Congress asking 
for some machinery needed by 
the State Department to clear up 
certain financial tangles with 
Mexico, five nominations, many 
letters, memos, odds, ends. The 
other was Mrs. Roosevelt’s gaso- 
line rationing card. Faced with 
getting along on three gallons 
per week, Mrs. Roosevelt told 
the President she intended to 
take up bicycling seriously. 

Free Speech Doesn’t Mean 
Careless Talk.

A Patriot And Statesman 

As he arrives today, Asheville and the Western North 
Carolina community heartily welcome President Manuel L. 
Quezon of the Philippine Commonwealth, his family and his 
staff. The fortunes of war for the time hate transferred the 
seat of this Government-in-exile to Ann Hathaway Cottage and 
Grove Park inn. 

May President Quezon find here rest and the good health 
he seeks. May the day be not long delayed when the in- 
vaders will be driven from his native islands, and when he will 
he restored to his Presidency in Manila, to become in all prob- 
ability the first President after the commonwealth merges into 
the independent nation, according to the agreement between 
the United States and the Philippines. 

The guns of Admiral Dewey’s fleet at Cavite that May 1 
Day morning in 1898 heralded the beginning of a momentous 
career for Manuel Quezon, the young law student. He took 
up arms for his country’s independence. When the cause 1 
failed and at length he was released from political imprison- 
ment, he began his activities as a lawyer and political leader 
that have brought him so far in the midst of great events 
finally climaxed by the upheavals of another World War. 

As President Roosevelt said in one of his addresses on 
post-war problems, the relations of the United States and the 
Philippines have set a pattern to the world in the policies of 
strong nations toward dependent peoples. The welfare of 
the islanders and their eventual independence — these from 
the very first were the objectives of the United States. 

For 30 j'ears Mr. Quezon has understood the aims of | 
America in the Philippines, and with extraordinary insight and 
ability he has collaborated with the molders of that American 
policy, regardless of occasional disagreements or misunder- 
standings. 

Looking back on the prolonged American debate, begun 
in 1898, concerning imperialism and dollar diplomacy, Ameri- 
cans have right to the pride they feel over the United States 
record in the Philippines. No finer tribute to this record 
could be paid than President Quezon’s when he declared in 
the House of Representatives in 1942 that “death, ruin or de- 
struction’’ had not daunted the spirit of the Filipinos, “nor 
lessenfed their faith in America.’’ And when the common- 1 , 
wealth bill became law in 1934 he said: “No nation in history | 
has ever done so magnanimous and so unselfish an act as has J 
been performed by the United States in granting the Philip- 
pines their independence. . .Time can never remove from the 
minds of my people — those of this or any other generation — 
an appreciation of this act unprecedented in the history of 
nations.” 

Nor can the American people ever forget the valor and 
devotion of the Filipinos as they fought with MacArthur and 
the men from the States in Bataan, nor forget what they with 
their American comrades have endured, and still endure, as 
prisoners of war.

NEW YwivK TIMES, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1942. 


Roosevelt’s Speech on Philippines 


The following is the text of 
President Roosevelt’s radio address 
commemorating the seventh anni- 
versary of the Philippines Com- 
monwealth Government , as record- 
ed by The New York Times: 
Friends of the United Nations: 

Though the alien flag of a 
treacherous aggressor flies tem- 
porarily over the Commonwealth 
of the Philippines, it is with su- 
preme confidence in ultimate vic- 
tory that the United Nations 
commemorate this birthday of its 
youngest member. 

It was just seven years ago that 
this Commonwealth was estab- 
lished. By that time the United 
States had maintained sovereign- 
ty of the Philippine Islands for 
more than thirty years. But, as 
I said in 1935, when the present 
Commonwealth was inaugurated, 
“the acceptance of sovereignty 
was but an obligation to serve the 
people of the Philippines until the 
day they might find themselves 
independent and take their own 
place among the nations of the 
world.” 

Let me go back to the days 
when Admiral Dewey won the 
Battle of Manila Bay and Amer- 
ican sovereignty was established 
over the islands. To a very large 
part of the American people it 
seemed incongruous and unwise 
that the United States should con- 
tinue permanently a colonial 
status over many millions of hu- 
man beings who had already 
shown a desire for independence. 

Gradual Process Followed 

However, the United States and 
the leaders of the Philippine peo- 
ple soon undertook a long-time 
process of providing facilities in 
the islands for education and 
health and commerce and trans- 
portation, with the definite 
thought that the day would come 
when the people would be able to 
stand on their own feet. And at 
the same time we granted them 



President Manuel L. Quezon 


each other’s good faith was firm- 
ly established— and it was cement- 
ed into place during the bitter 
months of ordeal which followed 
the treachery of Japan. 

The brave peoples of the Phil- 
ippines— their army and their ci- 
vilians— stood shoulder to shoul- 
der with the Americans in the 
fight against overwhelming odds, 
resolute to shed their blood in 
defense of their liberty. Richly 
do they deserve that liberty! 

* ‘Pattern for the Future’* 


I like to think that the history 


through the practice of more and 
more self-government, beginning 
with local government and pass- 
ing on through the various steps 
to complete statehood. 

Even we in the United States 
did not arrive at full national in- 
dependence until we had gone 
through the preliminary stages. 
The town meetings in the New 
England colonies, and the sim- 
ilar local organizations in other 
colonies, gradually led to county 
government and then to State 
government. That whole process 
of political training and develop- 
ment preceded the final forma- 
tion of our permanent Federal 
government in 1789. 

Such training for independence 
is essential to the stability of in- 
dependence in almost every part 
of the world.. Some peoples need 
more intensive training and longer 
years of it; others require far 
less training and shorter periods 
of time.

Filipino Cooperation Cited 

The recent history of the Phil- 
ippines has been one of national 
cooperation and adjustment and 
development. We are sure now, 
if ever we doubted, that our gov- 
ernment in the United States 
chose the right and the honorable 
course. 

The pattern which was followed 
there is essentially a part and 
parcel of the philosophy and the 
ideals of the United Nations. The 
doctrine which controls the am- 
bitions and directs the ruthless- 
ness of our enemies— that there is 
one master folk destined to rule 
all other peoples— is a doctrine 
now on its way to destruction 
for all time to come. 

The United States and the Phil- 
ippines are already engaged in 
examining the practical economic 
problems of the future — when 
President Quezon and his govern- 
ment are reestablished in the cap- 
ital of Manila. He and I, in con- 
ference last week, have agreed 
to set up a joint commission of 
our two countries, to study the 
economic situation which will 
face the nation which is soon to 
be, and to work out means of 
preserving its stability and above 
all, its security. 

This typifies, I think, the high- 
est form of good faith that exists 
wholeheartedly between our two 
governments. 

It does more than that. It is 
a realistic symbol of our grim 
determination and of our supreme 
confidence that we shall drive 
the Japanese army out of the 
Philippines— to the last man. 

President Quezon— on this aus- 
picious anniversary — I salute, 
through you, the people of the 
Philippine Islands. I salute their 
courage. I salute their indepen- 


dence.

Roosevelt Accepts Philippine 
Gift of the Bataan as Token 
of Unity in Fight for Freedom 


FILIPINOS h/!AN VESSEL 


They Are Enrolled in Coast 
Guard, to Which the Craft 
Is Assigned for Service 


Special to The New York Times. 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15— Pres- 


ident Manuel Quezon of the Philip- 
pine Commonwealth announced to- 
day the presentation of the Philip- 
pine patrol vessel Bataan to the 
United States Government. The 
boat was accepted by President 
Roosevelt and turned over at once 
to the Coast Guard for service. 


The vessel, formerly the yacht 
Limbas owned by J. M. Elizalde, 
Philippine Resident Commissioner, 
has Filipino officers and crew, who 
have been enrolled in the Coast 
Guard Reserve. 


The Bataan was accepted for the 
Coast Guard by Vice Admiral Rus- 
sell R. Waesche, commandant. 


In his letter of presentation to 
President Roosevelt, President 
Quezon said: 

“On behalf of the Government of 


the Commonwealth of Philippines, 
it is my great pleasure to present 
the N. V. Bataan to the Govern- 


ment of the United States. I beg 
you to accept this vessel as a token 
of undying Filipino determination 
to fight under your command until 
the war is won. 

“The Filipino officers and crew 
who will man this vessel are now 
regular members of the United 
States Coast Guard Reserve. 

“They, and this Coast Guard 
patrol boat, represent the desire of 
every one of the seventeen million 
Filipinos, whether under enemy 
domination or on free soil, to go 
into action again in the fight for 
freedom.” 


In the letter of acceptance Presi- 
dent Roosevelt wrote: 


“We stand with almost all the 


S31J3W 


ties of history and Latin culture,” 
and that this was particularly true 
of Mexico, he had invited President 
Avila Camacho to speak over the 
radio. 

The latter also recalled thees 
ties. Praising Mr. Quezon’s leader- 
ship of the Filipinos, first as a 
revolutionary and later as a gov-

“We in America know from ex- 
perience that the best training for 
self-government is the acceptance 
of complete responsibilities, and we 


cord with this spirit of sacrifice. It 
is accepted in the same spirit given 
since we of the United States are 
willing to give up opr all, too, in 
order that the warmth of love and 
peace may again be restored to the 
earth. 

“Finally, you and your people 
can rest assured that we will know 
how to re-establish that liberty 
which we founded. 

“I accept the Bataan in the name 
of our government and for our 
Coast Guard, not only as a token, 
but as a valuable aid in our com- 
mon effort. It is a symbol of our 
common purpose and our eternal

Defiant Quezon Predicts Stars and Stripes Will Fly Over Manila By 1945

Strike Now 9 
Filipino Chief 
Urges Allies 

By JEANNE BELLAMY 
Herald Staff Writer 

The voice of a freedom-loving 
little nation, silenced now by Jap- 
anese guns, was raised at Miami 
Beacli Friday in a call for speed 
by the United Nations in launch- 
ing a major offensive in the Pa- 
cific. 

The speaker was Manuel Luis 
Quezon, frail 64-year-old head 
of the Philippine government- 
| in-exile. 

His dark eyes flashed as he pre- 
: dieted “the American flag may be 
: seen floating again over the city 
! of Manila by the end of 1944 or 
i the beginning of 1945” if prepara- 
! lions are started now' for an as- 
i sault on Japan. 

“TIME TO STRIKE” 

“While I have no criticism to 
make of the effort that is being 
made now in Europe to defeat Hit- i 
4er,” he continued, “I think it 
should be remembered that Japan, 
j with her conquests, has acquired 
j worlds of war materials that she 
j needed badly for the war. She 
i should not be permitted to consol- 
idate her gains in these countries. 

I “I think the time has come to 
start striking in the Pacific.” 

He fixed the probable date for 
j the liberation of the Philippines, 
i “even though Japan may not be 
defeated by then,” on condition 
that “the men and the planes that 
are needed are sent to Australia 
within a reasonably short time, so 
that Gen. MacArthur will have .suf- 
ficient men and air power and 
Navy help to strike.” 
j Quezon agreed with Ambassador 
i Joseph Grew that “Japan will never 
crack in the way that Germany 
cracked at the end of the last war.” 
The Philippine spokesman saw 
| significance in the recent visit to ;

Washington by members of Gen. 
MacArthur's staff. Quezon spoke' 
from his intimate acquaintance 
with the hero of Bataan, who was 
sent to the Philippines to organize 
the commonwealth’s army at Que- 
zon’s request. 

“If he has recommended that 
something be done by the war de- 
partment, he knows his job and • 
his plans are the result of mature 
consideration and study,” 

Pie said MacArthur’s one ambition 
was to return to the Philippines, 
oust the Japanese invaders and 
prove to the Filipino people, who. 
rallied as one man to his standard, 

| that Japanese propagandists are ly- 
ing in telling the Filipinos that he 
! deserted them after inducing them 
to join him in fighting for a hope- 
less cause. 

REPUBLIC PREDICTED 

Looking beyond the current con- 
flict, the lifelong, champion of 
Philippine independence foresaw 
that, establishment of the Republic 
of the Philippines might come even 
before the now scheduled date, 
July 4, 1940. 

“f believe that when the Philip- 
pines are redeemed, the first thing 
the United States will do will be to 
authorize the calling of a general ; 

’ election to elect the officers of the j 
j Republic of the Philippines. No one 
l told me that, but I stake my life ! 

; on it.” 


He spoke also of the postwar des- 1 
tiny of the Philippines and other 
small countries. 

“My belief is that if the principles j 
expressed in the Atlantic Charter 
are put into operation, the future 
; of the small nations will be safe- 
: guarded.” 

1 RESTING, AT BEACH 

He saw this as one phase of a 
need for “much more economic co- 
operation among all the nations of 
the world.” 

“Those are the necessary things 
if we are going to have a world 
where the small can live side by 
side with the big fellows and where 
everybody will have an opportu- 
nity to work out his own salvation.” 

The man who has been president 
of the Philippine commonwealth 
since its creation in 1935 is taking 
a “complete rest” with his family 
in a secluded cottage at Miami 
: Beach. He reported he was “feeling 
much better” than when he arrived 
March 14. 

His graying hair harmonized with 
the grav of the suit, shirt and tie 
which lie wore at the press confer 
once, Friday, his only scheduled pul 
lie appearance here.

PRESIDENT OF 
PHILIPPINES 
ARRIVES HERE 


^ (Continued From Page One) 
that he has been called, like Wash- 
ington, the father of his country. 

When it became clear in 1898 
that America did not intend to 
grant the Philippines immediate 
independence, Quezon joined the 
forces of Aguinaldo and became his 
chief of staff, until the movement 
collapsed in 1901. 

Resuming his law studies at 
Santo Tomas university, he took 
his law degree there and entered 
political life, rising rapidly to be- 
come one of the two resident com- 
missioners in Washington in 1909. 
In 1916 he was made president of 
the insular* senate, the highest gov- 
ernmental post open to a Filipino 
at that time. 


Quezon's Condition 
Is Improved 

Miami Beach, April 4 (/P).— Man- 
uel Quezon, heroic President of the 
Philippines, is seriously ill at a 
military hospital here, but has 
! shown scyne improvement in recent 
j weeks. 

j Despite a chill suffered last night, 
the President received members of i 
'Rotary nlternational today and ac- 
cepted a presentation of flowers in 
commemoration of the defense of 
i Corrigedor and Bataan, which fell 
( two years ago. 


Accepted Tydings Act 

Through the influence which he 
gained with his own people and 
through his willingness to compro- 
mise with the American point of 
view, that a period of transition 
should be set up during which ex- 
perience in self-government could 
be gained, he was instrumental in 
bringing about the acceptance by 
the Filipinos of the Tydings-Mc- 
Duffie act — signed by President 
Roosevelt in March, 1934. 

A constitution for the islands was 
drawn up, and a plebescite ' was’ 
held in which Quezon was elected 
by a very large margin on Sept. 17, 
1935. 

The Philippine constitution pro- 
vides that no president serve more 
than two terms, or eight years, 
which would have made President 
Quezon’s retirement automatic on 
November 15 of last year. The 
U. S. congress, in recognition of 
Quezon’s contributions and his im- 
portance as a symbol of the fight 
for freedom, extended his term of 
office until the Japs be driven out 
of the islands, in a bill passed No- 
vember 10 and signed by President 
Roosevelt three days later. 

So President Quezon, who fought 
so skillfully and so well in behalf 
of his country, anticipates of his 
return. Needless to say the hearts 
of the American people are with 
him.

Valiant Quezon Fights 

Battle for Life, Hopes 

To See His Country Again 


A VALIANT LITTLE man with a will of iron and grim determina- 
tion to win this, the greatest battle in a career shot with struggle 
soon will wage his war from a sanitarium bed at Saranac, N. A. 

He is Manuel Quezon, President of the Philippines, who has been 
fighting the battle of his life, and for it, since long before he arrived 
in this 'country after a dramatic escape through the Jap blockade from 

embattled Corregidor. . , , . . 

A few weeks ago he was moved from Florida, where he has spent 
most of the winter, to Asheville, N. C. On Friday an order went out 
from President Roosevelt that a special t rain would take him from 
there to Saranac. 

An unwilling refugee to Amer-, 

ica. the country ho once detested templated by me . . . but 1 am 
and against which he once fought, | grateful for the sanctuary, just 
the dynamic, brown little giant tlie same /» 

made an unhesitating choice the' Later he added that he had 



aair-t mi" 

offered unlimited power if he 


would allign himself wifh Tokyo. 


“not be too long delayed, so that 
I may set my eyes again on our 


The Japanese radio had already beautiful Philippines.’ 5 


broadcast that he had accepted 
when, suddenly, 
he and his fam- 
ily moved out 
of their lux- 
urious M a 1 *■- 
canan Palace to 
Corregidor. 



|'TTE REFUSED 
to break 
the oath of al- 
legiance he had 
taken to the 
United States 

on the day that Manuel Quezon 
he became the 

first President of the Philippine 

Commonwealth. For two months, 
ill though he was, he was under 
continual bombing and then he and 
his family were virtually spirited 
away from beleaguered Corregi- 

dor. 

By submarine they were taken to 
Visayan Island, a trip that lasted 
two days and one night; then, in 
a motor torpedo boat piloted by 
the naval hero, Lieut. John Bulk- 
ley, they made the next leg of the 
journey to Mindano, and from 
there they flew by night to Aus- 
tralia in an Army bomber. 

I heard Manuel Quezon’s dra- 
matic saga from his own lips 
shortly after he arrived in Wash- 
ington. At his first press con- 
ference here the erstwhile insur- 


That hope is still his. It is 
prompting his current struggle— 
the fight of his life, and for it— 
a courageous saga, now to be con- 
tinued from Saranac. 

J~|UT IN THE PACIFIC theater 
^ of war, meanwhile, at least 
one naval officer is stationed be- 
cause of his love of the Philip- 
pines . . . and his desire that Presi- 
dent Quezon will live to see it 
restored to independence. 

He is Lieut. Comdr. George 
Murphy, brother of Supreme 
Court Justice Frank Murphy, who 
has served as a naval aviator in 
two wars. Now 43 years old, and 
with an enviable combat record, 
Commander Murphy could have a 
safer job on this shore if he 
choose. Instead he asked for an 
assignment at an advanced base 
in the Pacific, “in order to be as 
near the Philippines as possible.” 

■OJS BROTHER, by the way, was 
Governor General of the Phil- 
ippines at the time the Common- 
weath was established . . . and 
Manuel Quezon became its first 
President. In fact, Quezon re- 
called on his arrival in Washing- 
ton that his great friend, Frank 
Murphy, moved out of the Mala- 
canan Palace in order to turn 
it over to the Quezon family. He 
acknowledged his debt to Murphy 


rectionist, the fiery fighter who on a number of other accounts, 
once was called “the Irishman too, x’ecalling that he did much 

of the Philippines,” chuckled as to smooth the troubled waters in 


he told how the Japanese had 
spread the report that he had 
died of pneumonia. 

“Then they said apoplexy had 
carried me off,” he added, brown 
eyes twinkling. “And later still, 
that general debility had done it.” 

¥|E MADE IT CLEAR at that 
* '■ ^ press conference that he was 
an unhappy exile, an unwilling 


tocigijiwgtljK | 


Philippine politics shortly before 
the commonwealth came into be- 
ing. He brought order out of 
chaos in the relationship between 
the Mohammedan southerners and 
the Christian northerners; per- 
suaded the wild tribesmen of 
Mindanao to work with the gov- 
ernment; and fired, as a senator, 
the Sultan of Sulu, who for years 
had drawn pensions from both the 
refugee to America. “I want you Philippine and British govern- 

to understand that my present so- m ^ ts * 

, , “Murphy has been, and is, one 

journ was not pa ‘ i of our best friends,” said Quezon. 

“Every loyal Filipino knows that. :

'FILIPINO NATIONAL COUNCIL 



HON. MANUEL L. QUEZON 

President of the Philippines 


MeAAaCfe 


'Today, Commonwealth Day, all Filipinos, wherever they may be, 
should remember that it marks the establishment of their own government 
under the aegis of America, preparatory for the day when they shall become 
completely independent. In these days, when aggressor nations trample upon 
freedom and are trying to efface human rights with the bayonet, it is well 
for those who believe in democracy to commemorate historic events such as 
the birth of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, in order to draw vigor and 
inspiration from them and bolster up resistance against the invader. 

"The Commonwealth of the Philippines and the future Philippine 
Republic is a beacon light of human freedom that will forever inspire all 
liberty-loving people. Today let us gratefully turn our thoughts to our re- 
vered heroes who fought and bled to make our people free. Let us also pledge 
ourselves to carry on the fight against totalitarianism until total victory has 
been achieved, our heroic dead of Bataan and Corregidor avenged, and the 
cause of human liberty vindicated."

THE CATHOLIC NEWS, AUGUST 12 , 1944 


New Philippines President 
Classmate of Predecessor 
At Santo Tomas University 

Takes Oath of Office in Washington — His Wife and 
Ten Children in Jap-Held Territory 


Washington. (tC). — Sergio Os-* 
mena, Vice-President of the Phil- 
ippine Commonwealth, was sworn 
in. as President ot the Philippines 
by Supreme Court Justice Robert 
Jackson at a ceremony in the of- 
fice of Secretary of the Interior 
Ickes here a few hours after the 
death of President Manuel L. 
Quezon. 

The ceremony was performed in 
the presence of President Os- 
mena’s daughter, Maria; Secretary 
Ickes, Admiral Thomas C. Hart, 
Joseph C. Grew, former Ambas- 
sador to Japan; Francis B. Sayre, 
former Commissioner to the Phil- 
ippines, and members of the Phil- 
ippine Government in Exile. 


Mr. Osmena, who was a life- 
long friend and associate of the 
late President Quezon, paid trib- 
ute to Mr. Quezon and his 
achievements during a long life 
devoted to the interest of the 
Filipino people, observing that 
“no champion of liberty fought 
for such a noble cause with more 
determination and against greater 
odds.” 

President Osmena is the father 
of eleven children. Only his 
daughter Maria is with him in 
exile, his wife and ten other chil- 
dren having remained in the Phil- 
ippines. A niece of Mr. Osmena, 
Miss Olimpia Ubaldo, was a stu- 
dent at the National Catholic 
School of Social Service here 
I from 1938 to 1949. President Os - 
I mena is known as a devout Cath- 
olic. From the time he was a law 
student^in the University of Santo | 
Tomas, where he was a classmate 
of the late President Quezon, the 
two have been closely associated 
in the public life of the Philip- 
pines. In a biographical sketch 
entitled “Quezon and Osmena, a 
I Joint Biography of Two Providen- 
ancisco Varona 


. zon received his secondary educa- 
' tion in the first and Osmena in 
the second. 

“As Quezon was the most bril- 
liant student of his time in the 
Letran College, so Osmena had 
the same distinction in the San 
Carlos Institution, where he fin- 
ished his bachelor of arts degree. 

1 “The year 1894 found Manuel 
Quezon and Sergio Osmena for the 
first time at the University of 
Santo Tomas. Both took the same 
course, the law, and both imme- 
diately arrested the attention of 
their classmates by their brill- 
lienee. Being poor but brilliant, 
they were given the assistance of < 
free tuition in the university. 

“In these years of scholastic 
companionship there developed 
between the two a friendship that 
was deep-seated and they seemed 
to have had a premonition of a 
common destiny.” 

Mr. Osmena became Vice-Presi- 
dent of the Philippines in 1935 at 
the same time that Mr. Quezon 
became President. In 1936 Mr. 
Osmena also became permanent 
Secretary of Public Instruction, 
one of the most important ad- 
ministrative posts in the govern- 
ment of the Islands. During the 
recent illness of President Quezon, 
Mr. Osmena has carried on the 
duties of the office of President, 
with which he has now been for- 
mally invested.

INTERVIEW 

Text Of Howard State- 
ment Published For 
First Time 

iioy W. Howard, well-known 
Ame tie an publisher, has execut- 
ed a sworn statement containing 
the most authoritative and reveal- 
ing testimony so far brought to 
light on the late President Manuel 
L. Quezon's 'last instructions' to 
his war cabinet, the Manila Post 
learned yesterday from unim- 
peachable sources. The signific- 
ant revelations in the affidavit, 
which might have an important 
bearing on the collaborationist 
trials in the Philippines, were first 
reported by the Post in its issu** 
for Bee 4, 

Interview Quezon 
The Howard se gment, recount- 
ing an interview he had with. 
Quezon on March 2), 1044, con- 
firms the claims that Quezon, in- 
structed members of his cabinet 
to Temain at their posts "m the 
interest of the Filipino people," 
and that he maintained an “uai- 
shaken belief'' in the loyalty of 
Manuel Roxas and other leaders 
(Continued on jtage 6) 

he had left behind, with the ex- 
ception of Jorge B. Vargas, re- 
garding whom he wa» “forced" to 
“reserve judgment" until all the 
facts were in. 

Executed in New York on Oct. 
29, 1945, the Howard statement 
follows in full: 

“New 'York, N. Y. 
“October 29, 1945 
“A STATEMENT 
“On Tuesday, March 21st, 1944, 
shortly after 9:00 p.m., accord- 
ing to my ov.> diary notes of that 
date, I called on President Manuel 
Quezon at the Nautilus Hospital 
in Miami, Florida, 1 found the 
President to be a very ill man, 
and I limited our conversation to 
something less than forty-five 
minutes. 

*** Puppets* Mentioned * 
“During the course of our con- 
versation we discussed the acti- 
vities of a number of our mutual 
friend^ in Manila and the charges 
being printed in the American 
press of the so-called collabora- 
tionists activities of some of these 
men. Among those mentioned 
were Phil Buencamino, Arsenio 
Luz, Manuel Roxas, Joe Yulo, Ra- 
fael Alunan and Jorge Vargas, as 
well as some others less well 
known to me whose names escape 
me. 

“President Quezon told me that 
he had established some sort of 
radio contact with these men, and 
that for the most part he believ- 
ed that the charges of collabora- 
tion brought against them were 
the result of their having carried 
cut his personal and direct* ins 
tractions to them, in the interest 
of occupation, the work which they 
had done, in the manner in which 
they had previously done It under 
I he Commonwealth government. 
He discussed in detail and with 
high approval the work done by 
Manuel Roxas and expressed con- 
siderable concern for his ultimate 
safety. 

Quezon Faith Unshaken 

“President Quezon told me that 



( USIS cut) 
President Quezon 


his faith in these men —with one 
exception — was unshaken, and 
urged me to maintain faith in 
their continued loyalty to the Fi- 
lipino people and to the American 
Government. He told me that 
whil.e anyone of them might havs> 
made mistakes in judgment, he 
was absolutely confident of their 
loyalty and that his belief was 
unshaken that any action of theirs 
was taken in the conscientious be- 
lief that they were carrying out 
his desires and acting in the in- 
terest of the Filipino people. 

“Tl^e one exception which he 
made had to do with Jorge Var- 
gas 

Except Vargas 

“With regard to Jorge Vargas 
the President stated that reluc 
tantly he was forced to admit 
that he was not hanpy about som<> 
of the things Mr. Vargas was cre- 
dited with having done. He stated 
that he was not willing to con. 
demn Vargas on the basis, of such 
meagre information as he had 
and on the basis of press reports 
as he had seen in this country. 
He stated that because of his long 
and close association with Varga» 
and the understanding which the 
latter had of his, Quezon's desire 
and objectives, he found it very 
difficult to believe that Vargas had 
been guilty of anything which 
time would prove to have been dis- 
loyal to him, Quezon, to the Fili- 
pino people, or to the United 
States government. He stated that 
he was unwilling, however, to go 
farther than to say that he was 
being forced to reserve judgment 
on the action of Mr. Vargas until 
he was more fully informed as to 
all the facts. 

“The foregoing is a true state- 
ment according to my best knowl- 
edge, belief, and remembrance of 
the facts as stated to me, on the 
occasion mentioned, by President 
Quezon.

MLQ Never Doubted Loyalty 
Of Men In Jap-Sponsored Oov’t 
According to Photostatic Copy 

A surprise document — a photostatic copy of the 
supposed “Memoirs of the Late President Manuel L„ 
Quezon” the most important part of which declares 
that the President “never doubted the loyalty of the 
men who accepted positions in the Jap-sponsored go- 
vernment” — was introduced as evidence at the trial 
yesterday afternoon of Teofilo Sison, minister of 
home affairs and inspector-general of martial law of 
the “Republic of the Philippines.” 


The statement of the late Pres- 
ident, addressed to President 
Roosevelt, was purported to have 
said that “the men who accepted 
positions in the commission estab- 
lished by the Japanese are not 
quislings,” Continuing, the late 
President was further quoted as 
saying in his memoirs: 

“The quislings are the men who 
betray their country to the enemy. 
These men did what they were 
asked to do while they were still 
free under the protection of their 
government ... I am sure they 

are only doing what they think is 
their duty. They are not traitors. 
They are victims of adverse for- 
tunes of war and I am sure they 
have no choice. They accepted 
their positions in order to safe- 
guard the welfare of the civilian 
population in the occupied areas. 
I think, under the circumstances, 
America should look upon their si- 
tuation sympathetically and under- 
standingly.” 

According to Sison, who spoke 


On the witness stand in his own 
behalf, Sison spoke clearly and 
distinctly. Dressed in a white 
double-breasted sharkskin suit, 
with a striped blue silk shirt and 
a w blue cravat to match, the de- 
fendant looked his old self of pre- 
war days, with his old-time poise 
and confidencce. 

When asked whether he had in- 
tended to give aid and comfort to 
the enemy by signing the various 
documents exhibited by the prose- 
cution, Sison emphasized: “Never 
never; I have all the time been 
loyal to America and the Common- 
wealth, being actively engaged in 
the underground resistance against 
the enemy.” 

Quizzed by Judge Pompeyo Diaz 
on the instruction attributed to 
President Quezon, Sison said the 
president told them they “could 
accept any position offered by the 
Japanese, in the interest and wel- 
fare of the people”. 

Recalling the dark days of the 
occupation, Sison said that he re- 


to newsmen at the conclusion of ' mained at his post when the Jap- 


the afternoon session, the package 
containing the photostatic copy of 
the “memoirs” of President Que- 
zon was anonymously sent to him 
from the United States only last 
Christmas. Until now the sender 
prefers to remain unknown. 


anese occupied the city. He de- 
clared he saw Jap atrocities right 
on the first day of the occupation, 
witnessed maltreatment of civil- 
ians, wholesale arrests of his coun- 
trymen who were loaded in trucks, 
tied and manacled. “like hogs,” 
with their faces bleeding; he saw 
people slapped, kicked, lined up in 
front of Jap sentries, some kneel- 


ing and crying. lie personally 
was subjected to humiliation, bo- 
dily searched, detained for two 
hours in front of the Santo Tomas 
University, despite his protesta- 
tions that he was the chairman of 
the National Emergency Adminis- 
tration, in charge of non-combat- 
ant population. 

Sison began his personal defense 
of himself from the 26 charges for 
which he was indicted by giving 
his short autobiography. He start- 
ed by saying that he is a Filipino 
titizen, born of Filipino parents in 
Dagupan, Pangasinan, on Februa- 
ry 29, 1880. He received his first 
instruction from his mother; then 
enrolled in the San Alberto Col- 
lege at Dagupan where he obtain- 
ed his AB. degree. Thereafter, he 
became interpreter in the court of 
first instance of Pangasinan, serv- 
ing successively under Judges 
Elias Finley Johnson, Arthur 
Odlin and James C. Jenkins. As 
court interpreter he made a self- 
study of law, acting on the advice 
of Judge Finley Johnson, after 
which, through the recommenda- 
tion of A tty. Charles Kitchins, he. 
qualified for the bar examinations, ] 
which he successfully hurdled. i 

Subsequently, he began his po- 
litical career when elected as mu? 
nicipal councilor of Lingayen, ’ 
Pangasinan. He catapulted to I 
high politics when he was elected 
provincial governor of Pangasi- 
nan, to which post he was reelect- 
ed. He next became a senator for 
the 2nd senatorial district. 

From then on, he held impor- 
tant cabinet positions. At the out- 
break of the war he was the sec- 
retary of justice, concurrently ! 
holding the chairmanship of the i 
Civilian Emergency Administra- j 
tion.

instructions” of President Que- 


the defendant

said the late « 


^zon, 

Commonwealth president tolcj 
those chosen to remain to do theix 
duty to the people. 

%- 

Sison’s testimony throughout the 
whole day yesterday (to be con- 
tinued today), centered on the ef- 
forts of the defense to establish 
that aside from complying with a 
lawful order of a superior author- ; 
ity (Quezon’s last instructions), J 
the defendant lived, as the rest of j 
the Filipinos, in a virtual reign j 
of terror that it was impossible 
for one to refuse any order of the 
Japanese without his refusal being 
interpreted as hostile act, the re- 
sult of which was fatal. 

When, reference was made to the 
fate of the late Chief Justice Jose j 
Abad Santos, Sison impliedly said 
if he knew at the time that he 
would be in a sad plight as he is 
in now, he would have welcomed 
the fate of the late Jose Abad 
Santos, alluding to him as “for- 
tunate.”

FATHER OF HiS COUNTRY [/ 

As the Philippines approaches her national goal of inde- 
pendence, nobody is more sincerely missed than Manuel Luis 
Quezon, who died a year ago away from his native land. No 
man has done more to unify his people and to prepare them 
for their destiny as an independent nation than the late Pres- 
ident of the Philippines. No more apt title has been given him 
than that of Father of this country. 

Manuel Quezon died only 80 days before the American 
landing on Leyte, an event to which he had looked forward with 
marvelous courage and boundless faith. As many other world { 
heroes before him, the man who personified in the free world ; 
Filipino resistance against Japanese aggression was denied by 
death the supreme fruit of his labors and deeds. 

Save for this poignant fact, bereaved Filipinos took con- ' 
solation in the knowledge that Manuel Quezon had lived a long < 
and fruitful life in the service of his country. He was born early 
enough to dutifully take his post in the revolutionary army 
against Spanish tyranny, thus doing his part in paving the way 
for the realization of the dream of his boyhood hero, Jose Pvizal. 
With the same purpose in his mind, the establishment of an in- 
dependent Philippine republic, he fought the American forces 
until he was convinced that the American objective in the oc- 
cupation of the Philippines was to prepare the Filipinos for 
self-government. He took the oath of allegiance to the Amer- . 
ican flag; he kept that oath until his death. 

Endowed with a brilliant mind and a magnetic personality, 
Manue! Quezon steadily rose in political prestige and in the 
affection of his people. In turn he used the power and in- 
fluence he gained in the promotion of the welfare of the Fili- 
pino people and toward the realization of their national in- 
dependence. He became so well known throughout the world 
for his accomplishments as nationalist leader that his qualities 
and achievements as a public servant were overshadowed. 

Manuel Quezon will not be here when the Philippines as- 
sumes her proud place among the free and independent nations 
of the world. But his spirit will continue to guide the Philip- 
pines so long as there is a Filipino nation. No man has left 
a stronger imprint of his will, determination and personality 
upon the Philippines than the man who died a year ago.

These Charming People 

By AUSTINE CASSINI 

L EAVING tomorrow for California will be Mrs. Quezon, 
widow of the Philippine President, who would prob- 
J ably be alive today if he had gone to live in Arizona. 
If he had not considered it was his sacred duty to be as 
near as possible to Washington, at the disposal of this 
Government. 

Mrs. Quezon wants to go to 
California because the climate 
is much like that of her beloved 
islands. More important, as she 


said her- 
self, “In 
A m erica 
it’s the 
c 1 o s est 
place — 
toward 
home.” 

M a ny 
times be- 
fore her 
departure 
you could 
have seen 
her — a 
frail 
nun - like 
f igure 
kneeling 
at her 
hus- 
band’s 
tomb in 
Arlington. 


£.-!v 



Austine Cassini 

Praying for the day 
when she and he would sail into 
Manila Bay together. For that 
is what she plans. 

How strange that, the ex- 
president of the Philippines is 
temporarily buried in the crypt 
of the monument to the U. S. 
ship Maine. The sinking of the 
Maine in Havana harbor was 
the incident that started the 
Spanish-American war . . . which 
led eventually to the United 
States taking the Philippines 
away from Spain. 

But even more unbelievable is 
the fact that Quezon is hot 
buried alone. Beside him rests 
another leader, Ignace Paderew- • 
ski, ex-premier of Poland, ^ 
There they wait... in silence 
side by side . . One leadev from 
across the Atlantic ... one from j{ 
the other side of the Pacific. n 


T HE only time they ever met 
before they were laid down 
together in the same tomb on 
foreign soil was about eight 
years ago when they accidently 
crossed on the same steamer 
from Europe to the United 
States. . .The captain of the lux- 
ury liner, tickled to have them 
both aboard, gave a “presiden- 
tial dinner” to honor them. 

Afterwards the great Polish 
musician sat at the piano and 
played for the guests. Quezon 
leaned over him . . . “Mr. Presi- 
dent,” said Paderewski: “I’d like 
to close with your national 
anthem— but I don’t know it. If 
you hum it I’ll try to pick it up.” 
Shyly and shakily Quezon 
» sang a few quavering notes and j 
' they both laugh ed— th en im- \ 

provising a \ i 1 1 1 e Paderewski 
burst into magnificent music . . . 
Great thrilling chords, and the 
whole room was drowned in 
sound . . . One of those moments 
when the whole audience feels 
as one man ... To cheering and 
clapping the two took bows and 
with tears in his eyes Quezon 
told Paderewski: “It has never 
been played like that before — 
it never will be again!” 


O VER at the Philippines Com- 
monwealth Building o n 
Massachusetts Avenue when 
they hear of hilarious celebra- 
tion back home with the arrival 
of MacArthur they can’t help 
automatically thinking: “It’s the 
King of Leyte ! He’s putting on 
the celebration! Shouting wel- 
come louder than any of the 
others!” , 

Though they are almost sure 
“The King” was tossed in a con- 
centration camp by Japs they 
are more sure that “he must be 
on hand. No prison could hold 
him!” 


The story of the fabulous 
King of Lfeyte” is especially in- 
teresting now . . . The last time 
that Americans were fighting in 
the Philippines, during the 
Spanish-American War, the 
chieftain Agffihaldo first helped 
Americans and then fled to the 
hills and led the insurrection 
against them. He claimed that 
Admiral Dewey had double- 
crossed him first, that the Amer- 
icans had promised freedom and 
instead wanted to take over . . . 
It took an army of 100,000 Amer- 
icans three years to hunt down 
and capture the tricky chieftain. 


WHEN the last gun had been 
» » laid down some of the U. S. 
soldiers decided to stay a while. 
. . . Some were interested in 
teaching the natives modern 
hygiene, malaria control, or 
otherwise educating them . . . 
Some stayed for adventure or 
for the pretty native girls . . . 
And many stayed to make their 
fortunes . . . like Judge Haus- 
serman who became president 
of the largest gold mine in the 
islands ... a mine which pro- 
duced more gold than any 
other under the American flag. 

But of all them the most ro- 
mantic figure is the ex-dough- 
boy, Walter Price, who became 
known as “the King of Leyte.” 

From his palatial home in 
Leyte he “ruled” benevolently 
though none the less majesti- 
cally. Immensely rich from vari- 
ous indust ries, married to a na*

Jap General Occupying 
Quezon Home in Manila 

By JACK McBRYDE 

H1HE WIDOW of Manuel Quezon, visiting in Long Beach, is 

„ waitln § for a Japanese general to move out of her home at 

Manila. <S> 

Manuel L. Quezon, as governor 
of the Philippine Islands when 
the Japs struck, played a promi- 
nent role in the history of that 
group of islands. 

He and his wife and family 
were evacuated from Corregidor 
by submarine to an unoccupied 
island south of that fortress be- 
cause of Quezon’s health. Later 
they rejoined Gen. Douglas Mac- 
Arthur in Australia, after a safe 
and uneventful torpedoboat ride 
with the famous Buckley of 
“They Were Expendable/’ 

TUNNEL RESIDENTS 
“We lived two months in the 
tunnel,” said the quiet and digni- 
fied widow whose husband died 
last Aug. 1 in Washington. “It 
was so dark and dusty that my 
husband became very sick. They 
had to give him oxygen. He suf- 
fered from cardiac asthma.” 

Declining to discuss Philippine 
history, politics or prospects, 

Mrs. Quezon explained that she 
was not in a position to talk. 

Still wearing a beautiful five- 
carat platinum engagement ring, 
she said that she and her hus- 
band both came from the same 
town, Baler, in the province of 
Toyabas, a mountainous area on 
the eastern side of the islands. 

Her own musical' first name, 

Aurora, she passed on to her old- 
est daughter, Maria Aurora Que- 
zon. Her second daughter is 
Maria Zeneida. Both hold B. A. 
degrees. Maria Zeneida is study- 


ing at the University of Califor- 
nia at Los Angeles, taking a pre- 
medical course. Her son, Manuel 
Jr., 18, is a student at the Loyola 
University. 

HOME IN LOS ANGELES 

j The family resides at 1330 S. 
. Wilton PI., Los Angeles, their du- 
ration home. 




MRS. AURORA QUEZON 

The family drove to Long 
Beach yesterday to visit a family 
friend, the widow of Filemon 
Perez, former Philippine secre- 
tary of commerce and communi- 
cations under Stimson when • the 
present Secretary of War was 
governor of the islands. 

Mrs. Perez, whose husband is 
known as a coconut king, is visit- 
ing here with Mr. and Mrs. Dion- 
isio Laag,. 2075 San Francisco 
Ave. Laag is a steward in the 
U. S. Navy, stationed at Termi- 
nal Island. 

Yesterday afternoon, sitting in 
Laag’s home,- Mrs. Quezon was 
obviously homesick. 

“If walking would do any good 
I believe we would start" home 
now,” she said. 

She has not yet learned the 
name of the Japanese general 
now usurping her home.

Widow of 
Quezon 
Visits in S. F. 

Mi’s. Manuel Quezon, widow of the 
Philippine President who died in 
the United States in August after 
escaping with his family from the 1 
commonwealth, was a visitor, in San 
Francisco yesterday. 

A reticent talker, the handsome 
Mrs. Quezon revealed that her visit! 
in part was to participate in ob- 
servance of Jose Rizal day Saturday, 
honoring the eighteenth anniver- 
sary of the death of the Filipino 
compatriot. 

“Very encouraging,” she described 
news of conquest of Leyte by Gen- 
eral MacArthur, and expressed the 
hope that she would be able to re- 
turn to her native land “soon.” 

“I can’t make any prediction, nor 
can I tell my plans of returning,” 
she said. “I shall face circumstances 
as I find them.” 

She said the spirit of the Fili- 
pinos had not been broken by the 
Japanese invasion and that “Gen- 
eral MacArthur is greatly loved by 
our people. Our people have kept 
their faith in the promise of Pres- 
ident Roosevelt and the United 
States to return and liberate them.” 
Since the death of her husband, 
Mrs. Quezon and her three children 
have been living in Los Angeles. 
Her son, Manuel Jr., accompanied 
her to San Francisco.

AT OPERA VICTORY RALLY IN HONOR OF THE PHILIPPINES 

— - - mwt&m *• 


Quezon Supports Mme. Chiang’s Warning; 
Urges ‘ Remember Philippines' as Battle Cry 


President Manuel L. Quezon of 
the Commonwealth of the Philip- 
pines declared yesterday afternoon 
in a broadcast for the Victory Rally 
at the Metropolitan Opera House 
that Mme. Chi an g Kai-shek was 
right in warning the people of this 
country against the idea that Adolf 
Hitler was the single most danger- 
ous enemy of the United States. 

Quoting the First Lady of China 
as pointing out that Japan had be- 
come very rich in war materials 
and that, if she were allowed to 
consolidate and exploit her con- 
quest, she would become more and 
more difficult to defeat, President 
Quezon said: 

“I share these opinions fully, and 
I may add that I have made it my 
business to know the Japanese peo- 
ple.” 

United States losses were so 
great at Pearl Harbor, President 
Quezon said, that perhaps they ex- 
1 plained our inability to send help to 
j the Philippines, and they gave rise 
; to the cry: “Remember Pearl Har- 
bor!” That cry is now rarely heard, 
he added, as it brings the idea of 
i revenge, wnich is foreign to the 
American character. 

“I give you a better battle cry,” 
he said. <( 'Remember the Philip- 
i pines!’- the Philippines, where you 
! have suffered your worst defeat, 
where your flag has been tram- 
pled upon by the invader. I know 
you will never permit this national 


humiliation to be the last chapter 
of that story. And you have given ! 
the world undying proof that your 
relations with the Philippines for 
the last forty-five years have been 
based on the immortal principles 
of liberty and justice.” 

Recalling Premier Hideki Tojo’s 
declaration that Japan was ready 
to grant the Filipino people their 
“independence with honor” if they 
would stop fighting by the side of 
the United States, President Que- 
zon said: 

“The whole world knows our an- 
swer. We went on fighting to the 
bitter end. This we did because in 
the past you have kept faith with 
us. The flower of our youth with- 
ered in the battle— but they won 
for their people real freedom for 
all time. 

Mrs. August Belmont, .honorary 
chairman and founder of the Met- 
ropolitan Opera Guild, was hostess 
of the rally. Frederick Jagel of the 
I Metropolitan Company was chair- 
' man for the day. Secretary of the 
Interior Harold L. Ickes was to 
I have spoken, but was unable to be 
; present. Among those present were 
Vice President Sergio Osmana of 
, the Philippines, Mrs. Quezon, wife 
; of the President, and Lucrezia 


Bori. President Quezon was unable 
to leave his hotel because of ijisu 
health, still impaired by the hard- 
ships of the war before he left the 1 
Philippines, and he spoke from his I 
suite.

Farrington Pays Stirring Tribute To Quezon 
At Wreath Ceremony In Arlington Ceremony 



Congressional delegate from Hawaii says progress of Filipinos in Territory has been 
rapid. Says influence of first President extended far beyond his native land. 


“The mission that brings us to this hallowed spot today is the result of a 
meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii, on September 4th, slightly lpore than a month ago. 

“This meeting was arranged under the auspices of the Filipino Federation of 
America. Present were many of the leading Filipinos of Hawaii. The guests 


included both men and women. Amon 
of the diverse activities in which the 
important contribution they are mak- 
ing today to the progress of this Amer- 
ican territory and the winning of the 
war. They came from positions of im- 
portance in community life, the pro- 
fessions of commerce and industry. 

I 

FILIPINOS' ROLE IMPORTANT 

“The position of the Filipinos in 
Hawaii is a particularly significant 
one, as they are concentrated there in 
greater numbers and occupy as a group 
a position of relatively much greater 
importance than any other area out- 
side of their native islands. Their prog- 
ress in the environment of those is- 


g them were representatives of nearly all 
Filipinos are now engaged in the vitally 

lands had been notably rapid. Their 
role in the vitally important part that 
Hawaii is playing in the prosecution 
of the Pacific war has been marked by 
an intense determination to do every- 
thing possible to redeem their native 
lend, by great industry and a manifest 
desire to make every possible sacrifice. 
But in this, and in the hours of use- 
ful activity that have preceded this cri- 
sis, they have always retained an in- 
tense and lasting devotion to the 
Philippines, and notably to the lead- 
er who so ably expressed their highest 
aspirations.

Finance and Auditor General of the Philippines, Mrs. Joseph R. 
Farrington, Mrs. Manuel L. Quezon, and Delegate Joseph R. Far- 
rington, who placed the wreath in the name of the Filipinos in Hawaii 


“It was to the memory of Manuel 
Quezon, therefore, that this meeting < 
was principally devoted. It was an oc- 
casion calculated to give the greatest 
possible emphasis to the deep feelings 
of affection, respect and reverence in 
which they hold the memory of this 1 
great leader that they thus met in Hon- j 
olulu and adopted the resolution that 
brought about this ceremony today. 

QUEZON HONORED BY UNANIMOUS VOTE 


“The resolution was adopted by 
unanimous vote and, carrying the sig- 
natures of all those present at this nota- 
ble affair, requested that I use. my of- 
fice as Delegate to Congress from Ha- 
waii to decorate the tomb of the late 
beloved President Manuel L. Quezon, 
first President of the Philippine Com- 
monwealth, with a floral wreath on be- 
half of all the Filipino people of the 
Territory of Hawaii upon my arrival 
in Washington, District of Columbia. 
I am here, therefore, today, in fulfill- 
ment of this mission. 


“Any words that I might choose 
would fall far short of expressing the 
spirit of the occasion that prompted 
this action, the deep and abiding love 
of the Filipinos of Hawaii for their 
late President, and their devotion to 
the principles for which he so nobly 
fought throughout his lifetime. The in- 
fluence of his leadership extended far 
beyond the borders of his own native 
land, and closely touched the lives of 
fill the Filipino people in all parts of 
the world, as is so clearly evident in 
Hawaii, and I might say, on this . oc- 
casion today. 

QUEZON TAKES PLACE AMONG GREAT 



J 

j 


“I am happy to say on this . day, 
as 1 said on the occasion to which I 
have already referred, that Manuel 
Quezon has taken his place among the 
great men of our time. I lay this 
wreath on his tomb, not only in be- 
half of the Filipinos of Hawaii, but as 
an expression of the lasting admira- 
tion in which he is held by all Ameri- 
cans, and by free men everywhere. I 
offer this expression in the hope, too,

.Billie Blue Accompanies 
Mrs. Quezon On Boat Trip 


Is Proudest Jioy In County 
As He Meets Philippines 
First Lady 

Lilli# Blue Ray is the proudest 
boy in Marion county today. 

Ten days ago he learned that 
the First Lady of the Philippine 
Islands — Mrs. Aurora Quezon — was 
going to end a brief rest period 
in Florida with a visit to its larg- 
est and most heavily patronized 
attraction. 

Bill had virtually been lying 
awake at night since, as he pond- 
ered over the manner in which he 
might have the privilege of meet- 
ing the distinguished and gallat 
visitor. 

Dream Comes True 

Yesterday his dreams came true 
for Bill not only thrilled to the 
privilege but was invited to sit 
beside the First Lady for a chat 
as the visitors went down Silver 
River on one of the boats. 

That Mrs. Quezon enjoyed her 
very animated conversation with 
Bill for ovei- an hour was obvious. 
She admitted that she regretted 
that her own 16-year old son — 
Manuel Quezon junior — could not 


!— 

be with them. 

In any event, Bill more than 
upheld for his father, absent and 
in another 5 city • on business, the 
hospitality for which Ray and 
'Davidson are noted. 

Mrs. Quezon, htvrt vivacious 
daughter, “Nmi,” her physician, 
Major Emigdeo Cruz, and her chap- 
lain, Father Pacifico Ortiz, spent 
the entire day at the springs, with 
the latter three concluding the day 
swimming and boating. 

Ocalans On Boat 

They were joined on the boat 
trip by Mrs. W. C. Ray and Bill, 
Mrs. PI. A. Allison Wartmann, 
Colonel S. Tooey, and a Spring of- 
ficial. 

Last night, the visitors saw 
sound and silent color movies of 
Miami Beach, Daytona Beach, Sil- 
ver Springs, and a tarpon fishing 
trip in the deep Everglades. They 
will be denied visits to the spots 
other than the Springs at this 
time. 

While they did not announce

Quezon s Daughter Becomes 
Nurse's Aide to Help Islands 


Planning for the day when 
fhe can return to her liberated 
homeland and help institute a 
Red Cross nursing program 
Miss Maria Aurora Quezon, 
daughter of Manuel Quezon, late 
president of the Philippine Is- 
lands, yesterday became a full- 
fledged Red Cross volunteer 
nurse’s aide. 

Miss Quezon was one of nine 
graduates of the Red Cross Vol- 
unteer Nurse’s Aide Corps train- 
ing program who received pins 
at ceremonies at the Los An- 
chapter headquarters, 1200 
Vermont Ave. Her mother, 


brother Manuel and sister Ze- 
naida attended the ceremonies. 

In the Luzon invasion Miss 
Quezon sees a step toward her 
home-coming and said she hopes 
that a Red Cross nurse’s aide 
program can be undertaken in 
the islands because the postwar 
need will be acute. 

Presiding over the exercises 
was Mrs. Lloyd Aldrich, vice- 
chairman of the corps. Mrs. 
Douglas Corner, vice-chairman 
of volunteer special services, 
presented the graduation pins 
while the new aides were capped 
by Mrs. Lenore Green, R.N. 


Quezon’s- Widow Waifs 
Return to Philippines ! 

j LOS ANGELES, Peb. 6 (U.P.). 
j Mrs. Aurora Quezon, widow of 
President Manudl Quezon of the 
Philippine Commonwealth, today 
awaited Government permission 
to return to her Philippines home. 

She and her three children, 
Maria Aurora, 25; Maria Zeneida, 

) 22, and Manuel Jr., 18, will leave 
! as soon as possible, she said, re- 
joicing over news of Manila’s 
liberation. 

Her only disappointment, Mrs. 

' Quezon added, was that her hus- 
; band had not lived to return to 
t their native Pampanga Province. 

“We had hoped to return to- 
gether to a glorious reunion with 
General MacArthur and our 
people,” she said. 


THE CATHOLIC REVIEW, Friday, February 16, 1945 

American and Filipino soldiers 
Manila has been freed of the 
enemy, and a new hope awaits 
those still to be liberated,” de- 
clared the Rev. Francis Hoza, 

S. S. • C., pastor of the recently 
dedicated parish for Filipinos. 

With Mrs. Quezon were her two 
■daughters, Maria Zeneida, 22, a 
pre-medical student at the Uni- 
versity of California; Maria Aurora, 

25, a Red Cross nurses’ aide, and 
her son, Manuel, 18, a freshman 
student at Loyola University. j

Manila Women 
Leaders Here 

Local Filipinos yesterday honored 
the widows of two of their former 
leaders in a buffet luncheon in the 
home of Navy Chief and Mrs. F. S. 
Miraflor, of 2088 Harrison ave. 

Mrs. Aurora Quezon, who was the 
wife of the late Pres. Manuel Que- 
zon, and Mrs. Filamon Perez, whose 
husband was at one time governor 
of the province of Tayabas in the 
Philippines, as well as secretary of 
commerce communications, greeted 
old friends from the islands at the 
gathering. . J J . 

Mrs. Quezon, who had resided in 
Washington, D. C. until the death of 
her husband in August, 1944, now 
makes her home in Los Angeles, 
but said she would return to her 
native Philippines as soon as war- 
time restrictions are lifted. 

600 In Local Colony 

Mrs. Perez came to the United 
States with her husband in 1941 and 
has lived in Long Beach since his 
death in May, 1943. 

Joe Guzman, president of the 
Philippine Council in San Diego, 
said that of the approximately 600 
of his countrymen now residing 
here a large percentage hoped to 
make California their permanent 
home. 

Guzman said two of his sisters, 
wives of guerrillas, recently had 
been released from Japanese prison 
camps, where they had been hela ( 
♦since their husbands were captured 
and burned alive by the Japs in the | 
Philippines. |

Mrs, Manuel 
Quezon 


The mass, held in the private 
chapel of the Maryknoll Fathers at 
1421 Astor st., was expected. Be- 
fore leaving- the East, she wired 
Fr. William A. Fletcher, now a 
Maryknoll missioner here, but for 
nine years secretary to the Arch- 
bishop of Manila and liaison officer 
between the church and the Philip- 
pine government, requesting it. But 
the faded likeness of Pr sident 
Quezon was a surprise. 

Back in the days when peace still 
reigned in the Philippines, wo visited 
Manila. Mrs. Quezon was away atj 
the time, but wc met and inter- j 
viewed her distinguished husband,! 
and took some pictures of him and 
their home in the suburb of Pasay.i 
So when we learned she was to be 
liere between trains (the Liberty 
Limited and the Super Chief) we 
suddenly resolved to do something 
about that long-ago meeting we had: 
missed, and as an afterthought — ■ 
dug up those snapshots. 

We had an exclusive interview 
with her after mass. But we didn’t; 
get our story, because she saw 
those pictures first. 


“Oh . . . Manuel!” tears suddenly j 
stood in her fine brown eyes as site 
pressed to her lips our picture of. 
President Quezon. Then, with a 
glance at the views of their homes,, 
she hurried into a room adjoining., 

Suddenly the missioriers’ quiet 
dining room was noisy with youth- j 
ful voices, excitedly saying: “Look! 
Father.” . . . “Pasay!” . . . “Here’s 
where I was born!” . . . And soon 
we were surrounded by charming 
young Quezons — Manuel Jr., who at 
18, is a youthful replica of his 
father, and Aurora and Zeneida, his. 
smart, school girl sisters — clamor- 
ing, “Where did you get those pic- 
tures?” 

Still cradling the snapshot of her 
husband, Mrs. Quezon recalled how 
the Philippines president had con- 
tinued to dictate to his secretaries 
and issue orders “even after he was 
unable to sit up in bed.” “I feel,” 
she went on softly, “that he gave 
his life to his country like the sol- 
diers on Bataan.”

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 6\— Mrs. 
Aurora Quezon, widow of the Philip- 
pine President, Manuel Quezon, says 
the liberation of Manila, by Gen.

promises a new era of freedom and 
liberty for the islands. 

‘ Mrs. Quezon said she and her

leader behind whom all we Filipinos

freedom and liberty in our beloved 
islands,” she declared, saying she 
would go home as soon as possible. 

Her husband died at Saranac 
Lake, N. Y., last August 1.

pine Commonweal l h came this 
week to Mrs. Manuel Quezon. 

In her temporary home at 1330 


Wilton pi., Mrs. Quezon heard the 
news that Gen. Douglas MacAr- 
thur had made good his pledge to 
ieturn to Luzon. “He will retake 
Manila and all the Philippines if 
he has the necessary support,” Mrs. 
Quezon states firmly, “but he can- 
not fight with rocks.” 

Confident that MacArthur will 
not stop short of Manila if he has 
supplies and reinforcements, Mrs. 
Quezon describes him as “A man 
who will never give way. His am- 
bition ha§ been to retake Manila 
and avenge Bataan, and he will 
succeed.” 

The widow of the Philippine 
Commonwealth’s first president in- 
tends to return to Manila as soon 
as she and her daughter are per- 
mitted to do so. “It all depended 
on American and Philippine policy 
and right now we don’t know ex- 
actly when it will be.” 

Lingayen, where the American 
assault troops made their landings 
last week, is a familiar spot to 
Mrs. Quezon. She and her family 
used to drive from the capitol to 
Lingayen for week-end and picnic 
outings. Just as familiar is the 
Agno River, which traverses the 
length of Luzon to Tampangas and 
winds through many of the prov- 
inces in a manner similar to the 
Mississippi. 

“Unless Japan can launch an- 
other offensive — and I do not be- 
lieve they can — the war in the 


Philippines and perhaps in the en- 
tire Pacific will end with the re- 
capture of Luzon,” she predicts. 

Speaking of the gallant guer- 
rilla fighters who have aided im- 
measurably in the fight to liberate 
the islands, Mrs. Quezon says sim- 
ply, “They have not lost faith. 
They will fight and never give up 
until their land is free.” Each is- 
land, she explained has its own na- 
tive Filipino guerrillas who have 
been carrying on the most hazard- 
ous type of warfare since the 
spring of- 1942 when Bataan fell to 
the Japanese. 

With hand-made guns fashioned 
from gas pipe and shotgun shells, 
with grenades of home-made pow- 
der and coconut shells, with spears 
and native bolos, they have har- 
assed the Jap lines incessantly. 

Just prior to the invasion of 
Leyte, arms, ammunition, radio 
equipment and supplies were taken 
in to these fighters. Now an esti- 
mated 2,000,000 men on Luzon 
alone are relaying information 
about weather conditions, Jap 
troop movements and disbursement 
to the American lines. 

Her husband did not live to see 
his dream of a re-liberated and fi- 
nally independent Philippine nation 
realized, but Mrs. Quezon is certain 
that somehow he knows and is as 
proud and happy as she that Ma- 
nila will soon be retaken; that 
“They have returned.”

Both stressed need of aid for 
the Philippines, Murphy de- 
claring: “We in America have a 
moral and legal obligation to 
the Philippines above and be- 
yond anything else. There our 
flag flies, there our soldiers

These Charming People 

By AUSTINE CASSINI 

L EAVING tomorrow for California will be Mrs. Quezon, 
widow of the Philippine President, who would prob- 
Tf , ,a '^ be f hve today if he had gone to live in Arizona, 
ne had not considered it was his .sacred duty to be as 

Government 8 ^ 6 t0 Washing ton ’ at the disposal of this 



Mrs. Quezon wants to go to 
California because the climate 
is much like that of her beloved 
islands. More important, as she 
said her- 
self. “in 
A m erica 
it’s the 
c 1 o s est 
place — 
toward 
home.” 

M a ny 
times be- 
fore her 
departure 
you could 
have seen 
her — a 
frail 
nun - like 
f igure 
kneeling 
at her 
hus- 
band’s 

tomb in Austine Cassini 

Arlington. Praying for the day 
when sne and he would sail into 
ManilaJBay together. For that 
is what" she plans. 

How strange that the ex- 
president of the Philippines is 
temporarily buried in the crypt 
of the monument to the U. S. 
ship Maine. The sinking of the 
Maine in Havana harbor was 
the incident that started the 
Spanish-American war . . . which 
led eventually to the United 
States taking the Philippines 
away from Spain. 

But even more unbelievable is 
the fact that Quezon is not 
buried alone. Beside him rests 
another leader, Ignace Paderew- 
ski, ex-premier of Poland. 

There they wait ... in silence 
side by side. . .One leader from 
across the Atlantic . . . one from 
the other side of the Pacific. 

T HE only time they ever met 
before they were laid down 
together in the same tomb on 
foreign soil was about eight 
years ago when they accidently 
crossed on the same steamer 
from Europe to the United 
States. . .The captain of the lux- 
ury liner, tickled to have them 
both aboard, gave a “preside!* 
tial dinner” to honor them. 

Afterwards the great Polish 
musician sat at the piano and 
played for the guests. Quezon 
leaned over him... “Mr. Presi- 
dent,” said Paderewski: “I’d like 
to close with your national 
anthem — but I don’t know it. If 
you hum it I’ll try to pick it up.” 
Shyly and shakily Quezon 
sang a few quavering notes and 
they both laughed — then im- 


provising a little Paderewski 
burst into magnificent music 
Great thrilling chords, and the 
whole room was drowned in 
sound . . . One of those moments 
when the whole audience feels 
as one man ... To cheering and 
clapping the two took bows and 
with tears in his eyes Quezon 
told Paderewski: “It has never 
been played like that before — 
it never will be again!” 


O VER at the Philippines Com- 
monwealth Building on 
Massachusetts Avenue when 
they hear of hilarious celebra- 
tion back home with the arrival 
of MacArthur they can’t help 
automatically thinking: “It’s the 
King of Leyte! He’s putting on 
the celebration! Shouting wel- 
come louder than any of the 
others!” 

Though they are almost sure 
“The King” was tossed in a con- 
centration camp by Japs they 
are more sure that “he must be 
on hand. No prison could hold 
him!” 

The story of the fabulous 
“King of Leyte” is especially in- 
teresting now . . . The last time 
that Americans were fighting in 
the Philippines, during the 
Spanish-American War, the 
chieftain Aguinaldo first helped 
Americans and then fled to the 
hills and led the insurrection 
against them. He claimed that 
Admiral Dewey had double- 
crossed him first, that the Amer- 
icans had promised freedom and 
instead wanted to take over . . . 
It took an army of 100,000 Amer- 
icans three years to hunt down 
and capture the tricky chieftain. 


IIT’HEN the last gun had been 
y t laid down some of the U. S. 
soldiers decided to stay a while. 
. . . Some were interested in 
teaching the natives modern 
hygiene, malaria control, or 
otherwise educating them . . . 
Some stayed for adventure or 
for the pretty native girls . . . 
And many stayed to make their 
fortunes . . . like Judge Haus- 
serman who became president 
of the largest gold mine in the 
islands ... a mine which pro- 
duced more gold than any 
other under the American flag. 

But of all them the most ro- 
mantic figure is the ex-dough- 
boy, Walter Price, who became 
known as “the King of Leyte.” 

From his palatial home in 
Leyte he “ruled” benevolently 
though none the less majesti- 
cally. Immensely rich from vari- 
ous industries, married to a na- 


tive girl who bore him 11 chil- 
dren, he was much loved by 
all the people ... No official 
visited his “domain” in the 
Philippines from anywhere in 
the world without sitting at 
least once to a grand banquet 
at his table, which seated well 
over 100 guests comfortably . . . 
His parties in Manila were so 
lavish the whole city would 
whisper, “The King of Leyte 
has come to town! Whoop-pee! 
Champagne and all-night cele- 
bration for everybody!” ... He 
gathered guests in off the high- 
ways just for the pleasure of 
paying their checks. 

D ark-haired, six feet tail, 
Walter Price was 225 
pounds of dynamic American 
... He looked like a king, lived 
like a king, and had made a 
king’s fortune in his tropical 
paradise. 

I wonder if any of our soldier 
boys will, when the liberation 
day is here, as he did after the 
Spanish-American War . . . stay 
on — alid on — in that world 
where the dawn comes up like 
thunder . . . and the sunshines 
are almost endless. 

If we don’t make home seem 
the same happy prosperous place 
they left . . . who can blame 
them for wanting to become, 
perhaps, kings in Leyte, or even 
Brittany?

Thanks Given 

for Freed 

! \ ; 

Philippines V idory 
Prayers Offered 

Los Angeles citizens of all 
faiths yesterday went to the 
battlefields around Manila 
with their prayers of thanks- 
giving. 

This was their response to 
General Douglas MacArthur’s 
suggestion that the people on the 
home front give thanks to the 
Divinity for victory in the Phil- 
ippines. 

This was the people's thanks 
for the liberation of their loved 
ones from domination of the 
Japs. 

In the small Catholic Filipino 
church of St. Columban, where 
so many of the parishioners have 
relatives and friends in the Phil- 
ippines, Father Francis Hoza cel- 
ebrated a special high mass of 
thanksgiving. 

MRS. QUEZON PRESENT 

Among the grateful communi- 
cants were the widow of the late 
President of the Philippines, Mrs. 
Manuel L. Quezon; her daugh- 
ters, Maria Aurora and Maria 
Zeneida, and her son, Manuel. 

Even to this bare church came 
some who remembered the bitter 
retreat down Bataan. Like Colonel 
George S. Clarke, commander of 
: the 57th Infantry Regiment— the 
one that fought the rear guard 
action. He was there with his 
wife and Mrs. James R. Young, 
wife of Jimmy Young, Interna- 
tional News Service correspond- 
ent, who was stationed in Japan 
for many years. 

All worshiped in the spirit of 
i Father Hoza's words: 

"God has heard our prayers 
and through the means of 
American aid Filipino soldiers 
has restored liberty, and for 
this belssing we give thanks.” 
In St. Paul's Episcopal Cathe- 
dral, the Very Reverend F. Eric

Mrs. Quezon Pleads for National 
Unity in First Public Appearance 


In her first public appearance 
since her return to the Philippines 
last week, Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon, 
widow of the late Commonwealth 
President, made a fervent plea for 
national unity at an informal gather- 
ing In Antipolo, last Sunday. 

She told a gathering made up of 
delegations of municipal officials of 
Rizal and women’s club organization 
that they should forget past political 
differences and work together for 
the rehabilitation and reconstruction 
of the country. 

“It was the devout and last wish 
of my late husband to return to the 
Philippines and continue serving his 
people as he did in his lifetime,’’ 
Mrs. Quezon said. „ 

“He is dead now but you can ho- 
nor his memory by working for the 
preservation of all those things he 
had done for the welfare of the peo- 


ple,” she concluded. 

Mrs. Quezon went to Antipolo pri- 
marily to hear mass as is her wont 
whenever she returns from a trip 
abroad. She was accompanied, be- 
sides her three children, by Congress- 
man Emilio de la Paz and Brig Gen. 
Rafael Jalandoni, chief of staff of 
the Philippine Army. 

She was received by delegations of 
provincial and municipal officials 
and women’s club organizations of 
Rizal. After hearing mass Mrs. Que- 
zon proceeded to Maytime, a club- 
house, where she received friends 
and welcoming parties. 

The former first lady, seeing the 
eagerness of the people to hear from 
her, addressed them briefly in Taga- 
log, emphasizing the need for nation- 
al unity and harmony. 

Mrs. Quezon is reported planning 
to rest for a few days and then vi- 
sit her farm in Arayat, Pampanga.

Mrs. Quezon Cries When She Steps 
On Philippine Soil After 4 Years 


^ The plane circled over Nichols

three-point landing at exactly 2 :01. 

When the door of the plane open- 
ed, and President Osmena attired

ed at the doorway, the 19-gun sa- 
lute in his honor began. He waved 
to the crowd, stepped back into the 
plane and emerged leading by the 
«,rin Doha Aurora Aragon, widow 
| of the late President Manuel JL. 
Quezon. Mrs. Quezon waved a chif- 
fon handkerchief in the air and des- j 
cended, assisted by the President,! 
while she daubed tears from her 
eyes. Behind them followed Sera- 
pio Canoeran, private secretary to 
the President, Professor Vicente G. 
oinco, adviser to the President; and 
secretary of Finance and Mra. 
Jaime Hernandez. 

Mrs. Quezon was welcomed in a

President. Both cried unashamedly. 
Then the President embraced and 
kissed Mrs. Osmena while Mrs. 
Quezon shook hands with Secretary 
Montelibano. General JalandonS 
then stepped forward, whereupon 
Mrs. Quezon, on seeing the former 
aid-de-camp of her deceased hus- 
band burst again into sobs. 

Around them, Filipino and Amt» 
dean photographers were busy ta- 
king pictures of the event. Mrs.

the plane. With the Quezon girls, 
Baby and Nini, were Alicia Afable, 
Elena Yulo, Jenny Araneta and Car- 
men Montinola, who took courses 
in leading American colleges ,fpr

The big crowd was at first held 
back but it soon broke the police 
cordon and rushed forward to greet 
the arrivals. 

Senate President Manuei Roxas. 
Speaker Jose Zulueta, Budget Com. 
missioner Ismael Mathay, and the 
department secretaries and under- 
secretaries each took his turn in 
welcoming President Osmena, who 
ehook hands with them. 

Mrs. Soledad Ramos de Zulueta, 
wife of the Speaker, placed a thick 
garland of 3ampaguitas and roses 
on Mrs. Quezon, who wore a catt- 
ieya corsage on the left shoulder 
of her sports dre3g. 

Among the women were Mrs. Ro- 
*as, Mrs. Singson Eneainacion,

Manila society’s younger 3et headed 
by the President’s daughter, Rosie, 
?,nd the Misses Lourdes Alunan, 


Whitelock, and other U.S. and Phi- 
lippine military officials. 

The Special Guard of Honor was 
then inspected by the Chief Execu- 
tive, after which he stepped into 
his waiting car, sitting between 
Mrs. Quezon ^jid Mrs. Osmena. 

President Quezon’s son, Manuel 
Jr., Baby and Nini Quezon, other 
young ladies in the presidential 
party, and Ah Dong, the late Pre- 
sident’s faithful valet who also ar- 
rived with President Osmena, were 
accommodated in different cars 
which motored out of Nichols Field 
in line, with President Osmena’s 
car at the head, escorted by motor 
cycles of the Malacanan Presiden- 
tial Guard of Honor. 

Mrs. Quezon was escorted to her 
Gilmore (San Juan) residence, 
where she will stay temporarily 
pending her transfer to the Quezon 
Hacienda in Marikina, Rizal. The 
President and Mrs. Osmena then 
proceeded to Plaza Miranda, where 
a crowd estimated to be between 
sixty and eighty thousand, was 
awaiting the head of the nation. 
Both public and private schools and 
universities were represented by a 
delegation each. Employees of the 
different government departments 
and bureaus, and government-con- 
trolled corporations, also participa- 
ted in the mammoth reception.

MADAM QUEZON, widow of the former Philippines President Manuel 
L. Quezon greeted her father confessor, the Rev. Edwin Ronan, .who 
just arrived from the Philippines after three and a half years in 
Jap prison camps. Madam Quezon last saw Rev. Ronan in December 
1941 when she escaped Corregidor in a- submarine to the United 
States. Father Ronan was the priest who revived the late Filipino's 
faith while he lay ill in 1937 at Monrovia sanitariun'u 


Plead for Philippine relief 


MADAME AURORA QUEZON AND JUSTICE MURPHY 
They spoke of starving children and families in rags 


Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon definite, 
ly identified herself with the pro- 
independence groups who strongly 
| opposed the re-examination ques- 
l ti° n with regard to Philippine in. 
dependence in a speech before the 
community memorial program in 
honor of the war dead under the 
sponsorship of the True Filipino 
Labor Movement held at the City 
Hall on Sunday, December 9. 

She emphasized that the trials 
and tribulations, the hardships and 
i sufferings of the years when the 
, country was under Japanese rule 
had made a stronger people of the 
I Filipinos and that they were now 
| ready to share that beautiful real- 
ization of a dream long cherished 
especialy by the late President 
Quezon. 

Those who waver now are not 
true Filipinos, she said. Address- 
ing the widows who composed the 
greater portion of the crowd, she 
said, “I am widow, my children 
like yours, are orphans... I have 
always thought of you in my 
heart... for although I was far 
from you during those dark tragic 
years, I used to receive reports of 
your sufferings. And our suffer- 
ings have somehow strengthened 
our spirit and resolve to face the 
challenge of independence for 
which President Quezon and other 

( leaders have ceaselessly struggled 
to achieve.” 

Madame Aurora Quezon, widows 
of the late Philippines president, 

Manuel Quezon, and Associate Jus- 
tice Frank Murphy of the supreme 
court, conferred here yesterday 
about starving children and fami- 
lies in rags. 

They discussed first hand in- 
formation received by Madame 
Quezon about the plight of tens 
of thousands of Filipinos in the 
islands. Justice Murphy, former 
high commissioner of the islands, 
is national president of Philippine 
War Relief and Mrs. Quezon is a 
leader of that agency here. 

Madame Quezon told of whole 
families in rags, of children who 
have lived near starvation for 
years, and of atrocities committed 
by the Japanese against her 
people. 

The need for aid in the Philip- 
pines is now greater than ever, 

Madame Quezon said. The Japa- 
nese left the land devastated, the 
people stripped of food and cloth- 
ing, and homes and public build- 
ings piles of rubble. 

Justice Murphy appealed for 
support of Philippine relief, which 
is supported in part by contribu- 
tions to the Dos Angeles Area War 

Chest. 

"Rio" in America have a moral 
and legal obligation to the Philip- 
pines above and beyond anything 
else," he said. "There our flag 
flies, there our soldiers died, and 
there Filipinos laid down their 
lives for our boys." ^ 

Madame Quezon is awaiting 
word from the army when she can 
return to her homeland. 


Speaking before the same au- 
dience, Vicente R. Navarro of the 
Daily News recalled the sacrifices 
of the Filipinos during the occupa- 
tion especially the brutal treat- 
ment they received from the hands 
of the enemy. 

He said in part: “As we look 

back over a period of three years 
and a half prior to the day of our 
happy liberation, we could envision 
the languid spectacle of an almost 
unbearable suffering — maltreat- 

ment, oppression, hunger and slow 
death which culminated in the 
most Woody, irelentless massacre 
ever recorded in our history by 
the beast i^ the “Co-Prosperity 
Sphere”. Men, women and child- 
ren, helpless and defenseless non- 
combatants, were machine-gunned, 
bayoneted, beheaded or bombed : 
out of existence by the hordes in- 
toxicated with madness. We could 
still see the belowing and lapping- 
flames set by the criminal hands 
of the enemy driving people from 
their homes and consuming fall- 
ing buildings and fallen bodies of 
dead men, women, and children. 
We could still hear the merciful 
pleading* and wailing* of suffering- 
women, the heart-tearing cry of 
trampled children, the brave pro- 
testation of maltreated men, the 
fading mournful agony of the 
wounded and the dying. The pe- 
netrating* pain they suffered over- 
whelmed our hearts, wounded our 
pride and humiliated our soul. We 
feel the grief for those unfortu- 
nate.” 


Orchids To Mrs. Quezon 

The "beau geste” of Mrs. Aurora 
A. Quezon, widow of the late and 
beloved President Manuel L. Que- 
zon, in declining to accept the Pl,- 
000-monthly pension granted her 
by the government, deserves the ad- 
miration and commendation of the 
Filipino people. 

Cognizant of the fact that many 


war widows and orphans are still ill- 
fed, undernourished and ill-clothed, 
Mrs. Quezon decided to refuse to 
collect her life pension and instead 
proposed to Malacanan that the mo- 
ney be converted into a relief fund 
for the benefit of war widows and 
orphans. 

Thus Mrs. Quezon has once more 
proved her solicitude for the welfare 
of her people. Orchids to the kind- 
hearted widow of our beloved na- 
tional leader. Mrs. Manuel L. Que- 
zon!— Dr. Joaquin Balmorl, Jr. c/o 
Manila City Hospital. 




SATURDAY MORNING, JULY 14, 1945 


Filipino Army 
Officers Here 

Widow of Quezon 
Greets Guerrilla 
Fighters at Airport 

A group of officers of the 
Philippine army, two of whom 
escaped from the infamous 
“Death March” under Jap- 
anese guns and all of whom 
were prisoners of the Japs, 
paused briefly in Los Angeles 
yesterday on the long way 
around to their invasion of 
Japan. 

Last Monday they left their 
native Luzon, flying to 'Saipan, 
Kwajalein, Johnston Island, Ha- 
waii and thence by Naval Air 
Transport to San Francisco and 
Los Angeles. They arrived yes- 
terday by Western Air Lines 
and were greeted by Mme. Man- ! 
uel L. Quezon, widow of the late 
President of . the Philippines. 

Bound for Maryland 

They are bound for the Aber- 
deen (Md.) Ordnance Proving 
Ground, where they will attend 
artillery classes for nine weeks. 
Then they will return to their 
native land to join the Philip- 
pine Division which will make 
the invasion of Japan with Am- 
erican forces. 

“We — and all Filipinos — are 
anxious to help eliminate Japan 
from the map/’ said Jhe ranking 
officer of the group, Maj. Benia- 
min G. Molina, grimly. “We 
don’t want to have to live near 
those people an 3 unore!” 


u nil uuerrinas i 

All of the men, who had only 
high praise for their Yaik lib- 
erators and only contempt for 
the Japs, engaged in under- 
ground and guerrilla activities 
until their forced surrender. 
Most of the dozen men served 
an average of five months in 
Japanese prisons until the ad- 
vance of the American forces on 
Luzon forced their liberation 
from Camp O’Donnell. 

Elaborating on his remarks, 
Maj. Molina said: 

“We want to fight side by side 
with the Americans. We want to 
have a part in the elimination of 
Japan from the map because, for 
'generations to come, Filipinos 
will not have any use for the 
Japs.” 

The Filiopino invasion division 
will be composed almost entirely 
of men who fought with Gen. 
MacArthur in the Bataan Pen- 
insula and at Coryegidor, Maj. 
Molina said. 

He added sardonically that 
“Manila, our beautiful Manila, is 
almost 90 per cent destroyed and 
the Jap is responsible.” 

Maj. Ernesto Banes, a member 
of the group, displayed four 
fingers on his * left hand and 
shrapnel wounds in his chin. 

“An artillery exchange in the 
defense of Manila in 1941,” he 
explained. 

All of the men wore the blue 
and white bl^ze on their left 
shoulder, “Philippines Army.” 

Others in Group 

Those in the group included 
3rd Lt. Pedro Javier, who never 
surrendered to the Japs; Maj. 
Banes and .3rd Lt. Jesus Bau- 
tista, both of whom escaped 
from the ranks in the “Death 
March” and took off for the 
hills; Capt. Constancio R. Velas- 
co; 1st Lt. Juan V. Peache; Capt. 
Ananias R. Diokno Jr., 1st Lt. 
Anselmo Lazo, 2nd Lt. Cesar 
Montemayor, 2nd Lt. Jose Ace- 
vedo; Maj. Teofilo Almendras 
and 1st Lt. Demetrio Enriquez. 

“We are glad to know that 
you Americans here think that 
we did a good job out there,” 
smiled Bautista, who has ac- 
counted for more than his share 
of Japs since 1941.

Mass For Mrs . Quezon 

A mass for the safe return of Mrs. 
Manuel Quezon and her children will 
be said at the St. Anthony’s hospi- 
tal at 7 this morning. Breakfast will 
be served after the. mass. 


The Quezons 

Mrs. Quezon, the widow of our late 
President, wrote as beautiful a letter 
to the presidential secretary as one 
can expect from anyone. The senti- 
ments it expresses were those of a 
gentle lady. What happened? Mala- 
canan forgot about the letter, it is 
said. The Opposition spread the ru- 
mor the administration was not 
playing fair to the Quezons. 

Some friends of Mrs. Quezon (she 
still has some, thanks God) saw to 
it that the letter saw the light of 
publication even in a limited way. 

Of course President Osmena is too 
big a man to forget a letter like

Cadenas de Amor para Dofia Aurora 

Por COR\ s. de TIONGSON 


flj, PAS lo t cjos a nos de obligado exilio, Dofia Aurora Aragon 
de Quezon ha retornado a los patrios lares. Viene 
con esa plain de los ahos que tan bien sienta al oro de la sabi- 
durta, al decir de Amado Nervo. 


Dona Autoia es una buena senora, ana amiga leal sin 
presunciones m presuntuosidad, que no se olvida de sue hu- 
mildes amiguitas como nosotras. Es tocla corazon y buena 
voiuntad, la misma Doha Aurora de siempre, a fable y cari- 
nosa. Ella vuelve ahora con el corazon lacerado y prensado 
de angustia, sin la acostumbrada compahia de su bum espo- 
so, que durmio-el sueho eterno de la muerte en America en 
cuyo panteon de hombres ilustres reposan ahora temporal- 
mente susrestos al lado de la tumba de Washington, para ser 
i, remtegrados mas tarde al seno de la Madre Patria. 

Al ver de nuevo los objetos queridos de su hogar, que 
fueron un tiempo compaheros inseparables de 'ella y de su 
esposo, y que hubieron de abandonarlos vmpensadamente, por 
imposition de las circunstancias tragicas del ’Ul, su corazon 
romantico y alma de enamorada tuvieron que llorar silencio- 
samente, muy amargamente, al dar rienda sueita a su dolor. 

For que esos objetos queridos evocan en ella un mmulo 
de recuerdos de aquel gran hombre que fue su amado com- 
panero en. la vuki. Por eso Doha Aurora no puede memos de 
ser ahora mas tierna, mas sensible y emotiva. 

En aauellos cordiales saludos de bienvenida que hemos 
presencmdo que la tributaron afectuosamente sus amigos y 
los amigos del President Quezon, ella, como siempre, tuvo 
para to do s una amiable sonrisa, con dejo esta vez de tristeza 
y con lagrimas furtivcis que se deslizaban por sus mejiUas. 
En aquel intercambio de besos carihosos y apretones de mano 
se desarrollaban escenas verdacleramente emocionantes, al 
confundirse en qomuncion conmovedora las exvresiones de

Mrs. Quezon Breaks Into Tears 
Upon Sight Of Old Friends Here 


Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon, former 
first lady of tRe land, stepped from 
a C-54 skymaster of the Air 
Transport Command into Philip., 
pine soil at Nichols Field at a mi- 
nute after two yesterday after, 
noon, and into the welcoming arms 
of the Filipino people while tears 
flowed freely. 

Her silver tresses conspicuous 
against a background of a well- 
fitting black dress, Catleya or- 
chids quivering in her breast, a 
bouquet of flowers in her hand, the 
widow of the late President Que- 
zon broke into tears at the sight 
of old friends and acquaintances. 
High society ladies, elderly ma- 
trons as well as members of the 
younger set who used to surround 
•the Quezons at Malacarian be- 
fore the war and who assisted the 
first lady in many of her activi- 
ties gathered at the airfield long 
before the presidential plane came 
in sight. 

High government officials, 
newspapermen, G.I/s, and curious 
onlookers were ready to welcome 
the presidential party and to get 
a glimpse of the Quezons who were 
returning home for the first time 
in almost four years. 

With Mrs. Quezon were her chil- 
dren Maria Aurora (Baby), Maria 
Zenaida (Nini), and Manuel Que- 
zon Jr. (Nonong). With them also 
were Carmen ’ Montinola, Jenny 
Araneta, Alice Afable, and Elena 
Yulo who were stranded in the 


United States when the war Broke 
out. Others in the presidential 
party included former Auditor 
General and Mrs. Jaime Hernan- 
dez, Vicente Sinco, Victor Osmeria 
Serapio Canceran, private secreta- 
ry to the president and Dr. Do- 
mingo Antonio, private Physician 
of the President. 

The party left the field at 2:20 
and motored along Dewey Boule- 
vard The Quezons however stopped 
on Roberts to view the ruins of 
what was once their home. The 
family servants heartily welcomed 
them and there were tearful em- 
bracings again as loyal helpers met 
their famous employers. 

While the President proceeded to 
Quiapo to speak before the crowd 
that was waiting the Quezons 
went directly to their residence on 
Gilmore Avenue, New Manila. 

“I have nothing to say, I am sor- 
ry/ 1 said Mrs. Quezon while she 
was in the presidential car. A 
photographer took a shot but Mrs. 
Quezon, still in tears, hid her faco 
with a magazine. 

Turning to, a Daily News repor- 
ter who was waiting for a state- 
ment she added, “Tell them I am 
thankful to the Filipino people for 
this reception. I have always had 
a high regard for them." She 
ended in a sob, as the car sped 
away into the new city of Ma- 
nila that had just sprung from the 
mins of Battle even as the band 
played arid smartly attire guards 
of honor stood at attention.

[QUEZON’S WWW 1 
FLATS SABOTEURS OF 

P.L 


Saboteurs of Philippine indepen- 
dence. those who would vacillate 
now that America is all set to grant 
our political emancipation, were ta- 
ken to task last Sunday afternoon 
hv Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon during 
the necrological services for Filipi- 
no war dead at the city hall at 
which she was the guest of honor. 

Mrs. Quezon deplored that, at 
this stage of our political life there 
should be those that can afford to 
waver in the realization of our na- 
tional ideal 

“If this is the case,” she said, 
u ’f we are afraid to face the res- 
ponsibilities of an independent ex- 
istence then let us not even men- 
tion the name of my late husband 
because any attempt to sabotage in- 
dependence now would be to defile 
all his labors and sacrifices for his 
country and people ” 

If we falter now, she emphasiz- 
ed, it would mean that the hero- 
ism and faith of the brave soldiers 
whose memory we honor now will 
have been in vain. 

“I want to tell you that I felt 
very sad when upon my arrival 
here, the first report *1 received is 
the presence of anti-independence 
groups,” she revealed. “But what 
are we afraid of now?” she asked. 

She also pointed out that Amer- 
ican public opinion has recently ta- 
ken on a new complexion because 
of the reports coming from the is- 
lands that we are not united in our 
national aspiration and that law- 
less elements are on the loose. 

“Even some of my American 
friends,” she disclosed, “asked me 
if it is true that there are Filipinos 
who are against independence.” 

She also lamented that there are 
those among us who feel that with 
independence there will be no more 
relief from the United States. 

“This is a wrong view,” she ex- 
plained, “because the United States 
is committed to rehabilitate us for 
the loyalty that the Filipinos have 
shown during the dark years of the 
Japanese occupation.” 

Mrs. Quezon started her speech 
with a minute of 3ilent prayer in 
honor of the Filipino war dead. 

Addressing herself to the war wi- 
dows and orphans she beseeched 
them to be brave, for she too is n 
widow and her children are also or- 
phans. 

She also told them that she suf- 
fered as much as they did during 
the past years. Although away from 
the country she heard of. the sul- 
ferings of the people and was 
deeply grieved.

/ THE PHILIPPINE S 
The Letter 


As president of the Philippines, Manuel 
Quezon accepted many evidences of his 
country s regard. Officials of the Quezon 
regime gave him a yacht and the use of 
i oo-y ear-old Malacanan Palace, named 
new streets and buildings for him as fast 
as they were constructed. When the Philip- 
pines Congress met last autumn, after the 
liberation of. the islands, it voted his 
widow a pension of 1,000 pesos a month 
almost automatically. 

But when the first check was delivered 


and their children are not yet taken care 
of. . . 

The letter also helped to explain the 
late President’s profound admiration for 
his quiet, dignified wife. Wrote Mrs. Que- 
zon: 

T know [if I accepted] I would not 
be keeping faith with the memory of my 
beloved husband. . . .” 


last week, delicate, greying Mrs . Aurora 
Aragon de Quezon immediately sent it 
back. With it went a letter which demon- 
strated why thousands of Filipinos regard 
her as a combination queen-mother and 
patron saint. 

“I feel that on account of . . . countless 
war widows and orphans ... I should 
waive collection of a pension ...” the 
letter stated. “I cannot, in good con- 
science, receive . . . Government assistance 
when so many of my less fortunate sisters 


would be like a lot of laundresses taking 
in one another’s washing.” 

San Francisco, also out of the running, 
resorted to drafting its school children 
to/dood the mails with come-on po^ards. 


(Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon 

I am happy to observe the 
concerted efforts undertaken by 
our civic-minded citizenry in 
trying to rehabilitate during 
these still difficult times those 
pre-war . organizations which 
have definitely contributed to 
our national progress. 

Today, 1 especially wish to 
refer to the Boy and Girl Scout 
movement, whose main objec- 
tive is the character develop- 
ment and citizenship training 
of our youth. Our future- lies 
in the hands of our young peo- 
ple and it is our sacred duty to 
see to it that they are equip’ped, 




Patriotism 

Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon refused 
to accept the life pension of PI. 000 
monthly. She desired that it be 
given instead to the nation’s war- 
victims and this is one of the loftiest 
gestures of patriotism, unselfishness 
and generosity that a citizen can 
.make. M*r>. Quezon’s praiseworthy, 
highly commendable act should put

We who elected Manuel Roxas 
would like to see our former First 
Lady of the Land a member of 
his cabinet. Mrs. Aurora Que- 
zon’s appointment as a cabinet 
member, who, we believe, will ably 
fill that position like Mrs. Per- 
kins of F. D. Roosevelt’s cabinet, 
will greatly enhance the popula- 
rity of President Roxas among

show to the world that here in the

In her usual good spirits, Dha Aurora, talked on all sub-

Quite different from the days when, due to her husband s

Wife and Business Head 


T hough the Philippines voted 
Mrs. Aurora Aragon Vda. 
de Quezon (widow of the 
late President Manuel L. Que- 
zon) a pension of 1,000 pesos 
($500) a month, Mrs. Quezon did 
not accept it. She explained that 
she could not accept Government 
assistance “when so many of 
my less fortunate sisters and 
their orphaned children are not 
yet taken care of.” 

The pension proposed for Mrs. 
Quezon equals the highest pen- 
sion that the Philippines pay — 
the one they pay Gen. Emilio 
Aguinaldo, or did pay him before 
the invasion. It is $1,000 more a 
year than the widow of a Presi- 
dent of the United States re- 
ceives. 

Mrs. Quezon, being wealthy, 
does not stand in need of a pen- 
sion, small or large. The wealth 
Mrs. Quezon has she gained 
from her own business acumen. 
In the Philippine family it is 
usual for the wife to be the 
business head. The social eleva- 
tion of the family does not 
change it. Mr. Quezon was skill- 
ful in making money, less skilled 
in keeping it. Mrs. Quezon is 
skilled in both capacities. Her 
investments are diversified. 

A rich chromite mine is one of 
Mrs. Quezon’s holdings. The 
name of the mine is ACOJE, the 
“A” for Aurora, the “CO” for 
Consuelo, and the “JE” for 
Jesusa. Consuelo and Jesusa are 
wealthy women, intimates of 
Mrs. Quezon, associated with her 
in the ownership of the Acoje 
claims. The mine has access. to 
deep water and its product is 
high enough in quality to sell 
briskly in the market for chrome 
alloy. 

Another large interest of Mrs. 
Quezon is coconut plantations. 
Gen. James G. Harbord (chair- 
man of the RCA board), when 
in charge of the military in 
Tayabas, convinced Mr. Quezon, 
then Governor of the Province, 


that the people should plant addi- 
tional coconuts extensively. Que- 
zon acted by the extra-legal 
procedure of compelling all who 
wished to vote to qualify for the 
privilege by planting a minimum 
number of coconuts. It is in this 
region that Mrs. Quezon has 
some coconut lands, an unfail- 
ingly sound investment. 

Mrs. Quezon also has real 
estate in or near Manila, some of ^ 
it an inheritance from her late 
husband. 

Rice is another branch of 
farming in which Mrs. Quezon 
is interested. She has a large 
farm near Mount Arayat, in the 
central Luzon valley, where the. 
manager before the war was < k- 
Japanese. The Japanese have no 
rivals in the East in modern rice 
breeding and cultivation; this 
Quezon farm developed into a 
model for others, and a source of 
prime rice seed. 

Fish raising is another business 
activity of Mrs. Quezon. It is a 
Manila bay-shore industry in 
which the owners of tide-water 
ponds, that can be flooded and 
drained at will, grow fish called 
“bangus” for the Manila market. 
Many Filipinos invest savings in 
these fish ponds. Men .to watch 
over them are hired for a share 
of the gains, and the business is 
profitable. Fish ponds were 
another personal interest of Mr. 
Quezon. He liked to drive out 
past them, then on to the farm at 
Arayat, for rustic leisure. 

Though Mr. Quezon was a 
lawyer, politician, statesman and 
cosmopolitan, he was a true Fili- 
pino in that he never abandoned 
the soil or ceased to be a farmer. 
Mrs. Quezon’s business inclina- 
tions take a like trend, and much 
of her income in normal times 
stems straight from the soil, as 
does that of thousands of other 
Philippine women, many of them 
rich or well-to-do, whose names 
are of course less familiar to 
Americans. Phil Ritter

BOSTON, April 20 (UP).— The 
current issue of the Christian

--Mrs. Quezon 


The Filipino people should be 
ready to shoulder the respon- 
sibilities of independence, said 
Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon in an 
address yesterday. 

The address was delivered at 
the community memorial prog- 
ram held at the citv hall in honor 
of the Filipino war dead. The 
program was sponsored by the 
True Filipino Labor Movement. 

The Filipino, she said, speaking 
in Tagalog, faced their greatest 
test as a people, during the Jap- 
anese occupation. Everyone suf- 
fered physically and morally dur- 
ing the dark years of occupation, 
and in the numerous hardships 
and sufferings they underwent, 
everyone bore himself as. a true 
Filipino. 

He showed his capacity to go 
through adversity, Mrs. Quezon 
said. 

“If we have gone through 
such dark years, years of tribu- 
lations and hardships, as we 
have, then we are ready to meet 
the challenge of independence,' 5 
she said. 

Mrs. Quezon addressed herself 
particularly to mothers and wi- 
dows who made up the greater 
portion of the audience. She 
said she could feel what the 
thousands of widows and bereav- 
ed parents feel because she is 
one of them. 

“I am a widow,’’ she said sim- 
ply but her words touched the 
audience. “My children, like 
yours, are orphans. We share the 
same bereavement. I have al- 
ways thought of you in my heart 

—mothers who lost your sons, 

wives who lost your husbands, 

daughters who lost your bro-
