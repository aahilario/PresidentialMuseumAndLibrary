TOKYO, April 11 (Domeli.- President Roosevelt's accusation 
to the effect that the United States has been the "victim of skill 
ful deception" by Nippon is absurd and although the claim may 
have some effect on those unfamiliar with U. S.-Nlppon negotia-

dacious propaganda, declared Viscount Klkujlro Ishli, privy coun-

rurth tactics" is the railroad station of Cebu, in the city's outskirts. With no building nearby to transmit the flame from the 
houses in the distance, from which the column of smoke (above) comes, the station has survived Cebu's worst fire.

Wa i ffct . 

VVhen the vanguard of the Imperial Force* reach- 
od Manila on January 2, a new era dawnod. The 
'rehabilitation of the occupied areas was started with 
the creation of on Executive Commission, made up 
mostly of Filipino loaders who, before tKo war, were 
the popular choice of the electorate to run the of- 
fairs of their country. 

The Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Japan- 
ese Forces in the Philippines, oven white ho was busy 
subjugating the remnants of USAFFE units, u^rsed o 
spiritual and material reconstruction at a fundamen- 
tal rr-oirsite, without which th» Filipino nation would 
be unfit to survive. Present Fifioino loaders pledged 
support of this idea — and, w ; th it as the quiding prin- 
ciple, peace and o*der h» th* occupied areas ware 
sJowfv but gredueffv established. 

Business took the heck-to-norm*t trend under the 
sponsorship of the military authorities who renowned 
banks, peoqed prices, fouoht orofiteerinq and loot- 
ing. assured protection to businessmen and consumers, 



and did everything else compatible with the stringent 
circumstances to put business back on its foot. Farm- 
ers were given passes to the provinces and urged to 
harvest their crops. The Army rebuilt brieves *nrJ 
reopened closed roads in several regions, to ■ '. <-» 
communications among the people of the occupied 
areas and assure the farmers markets for their pro- 
ducts. The needy, the war victims, ovon the soldiers 
themselves were given help in some way or another; 
the stranded students, jobless workers and evacuees 
were sent home at government expense. 

Thus, after 20 weeks of war through which the 
Filipinos plodded with now courage, now hope in the 
future, life in the occupied areas is gettinq much 
improved. Futile resistance in remaining mititariied 
areas is giving wav little by little, and toon cannons 
and bombers would miiot down. 

This military-political achievement may not ba 
an unworthy a'H to His Imperial Mair»sty on thit 
day, his birthday, on the occasion of which this

The statement of the spokes- 
man follows: 

The fall of Corregidor means 
the total collapse off th* Fll- Ame- 
rican forces in the Philippines 
and th* end of American oppres- 
sion and exploitation which th* 
Filipino people have endured for 
more than 40 years. 

With the :oss of her Asiatic 
Fleet and of the USAFFE army, 
the United States has been driven 
o-it of the Philippines, which she 
plasnrd to use as a base to in- 
vade the rest of East Asia under 
the Mnner of democracy. And 
now the so-called A BCD defence 



line Is broken. 

Taking advantage of the resist- 
ance offered by th* s mall rem- 
nants of th* USAFFE troops ia 
Corregidor, American propagan- 
da has been trying to mislead 
th* peopU of the Philippines. 
However, th* fall of Corregidor 
has blasted this propaganda and 
opened the eyes off ths Filipinos 
to the real situation. 

The fall of Corregidor Is In- 
deed a turning point In the Ufa

CORREGIDOR IS A BAD 



T eight o'clock in the morning of May 7, Corre- 
gidor fell. The most heavily fortified island in 
the Philippines, along with four leaser fortified is- 
lands at the month of Manila Bay, finally snrtian fc- 
ed to the continuous deadly Japanese si salt. 

The occupation came scarcely two days after the 
f last landing on the island last Tuesday night, fol- 
lowed by the swift collapse of the FH- American re- 
sistance and the capture of Ihntinsal General Jo- 
nathan M. Waimvright. commander of the FB- Ame- 
rican Forces in the rhilippsari The Genua l woo 
captured and taken prisoner of war at llrOO psa. 
May 6, thus leaving the lifcaiiii nhhint a looter 
until the complete occupation the neat day. One 
night after his capture, he was

sectors to su rrender to the praput Jspantst Arsay 

officers. 

The first landing on COrreghtor woo effected 
shortly after 11:00 pan. May & Under cover of dark- 
ness and an intensive artillery barrage, the Japan- 
ese Forces, aboard a large nornhrr of steel barges, 
were at 8:30 pan. on their way across the narrow

The prisoners, especially those recuperating from 
injuries received during the days of incessant Japanese 
bomblnr »nd cannonading, enjoy certain privileges not us- 
ually enjoyed by other country's prisoners of war. Gen- 
erally, they are allowed a reasonable amount of freedom, 
as shown by some pictures here. At the same time, the 
husky ones are required to do some work. 

Representing the nay they take life's routine down 
there is the smile displayed by the hospital nurse plctur-

prospects of death from deadly Instrument, of war being 
IN CORREGIDOR definitely a thing of the past ,s far as they are concerned.

When Ike beet arrived in Manila, local hospitals 
were short of equipment, the sent* epidemic having 
broken out here too. There were no medicines, no 
ice. very few fecifities. As Japan and the U. S. were 
not in good terms, permission to use the facilities of 
the PWsppine Generel Hospital was not granted. 
The Consul for Jepen in Manila and the local Ja- 
panese Association made arrangements for the sick at 
St. Pad's Hospital in Intramuros. cabled to Tokyo for 
medical supplies, engaged the services of three Ja- 
panese physicians — Drs. Oka be, Okumur*. and Take- 
da — and organized tha local Nipponese community 
to serve as nurses and hospital attendants and to 
provide funds for the purchase of supplies. 

Dr. Takeda has nothing but the highest praise for 
the local Japanese who served in those trying days, 
many of them working in shifts that hardly allowed 
them to sleep for a whole month. 

The patients were later transferred to the Gar- 
denia Hospital. The epidemic was so severe that, in 



spite of the best attention and car* given the sick, 
48 officers and members of the crew of the Yahagi" 
succumbed to the disease and were buried with ho 
nors in San Pedro Makati. Commander Unosuke Fu- 
mon headed the Kst of the dead. The remains were 
later transferred to the BeKntewak Memorial Ce- 
metery, not far from the MB. where a memorial 
tablet was erected on January 19. 1919. This tablet 
was unfortunately destroyed by the retreating 
USAFFE troops before they left for Bataan. 

A month later, a boat from Formosa steamed 
into the harbor and fetched the convalescing officers 
and members of the crew of the Yahag: including 
Captain Denichi Yamaguchi who survived. 

In recognition of the splendid work they had 
dona for the nation in helping the officers and crew 
of a cruiser of the Imperial Nipponese Navy, the three 
doctors, their attendants and hospital staff, leading 
families who helped in various ways, and the Japanese 
Association, of which K. Fumetsu was president, were 
officially commended by the Japanese Government. 

Manila has, since then, been endeared to the 
Navy; and, every year, when January 19 comet 
around, the Navy holds memorial services in Manila.

NANG DIGMAANG ruso-kaponos noong 1904- 
1905 ay nag-aaral ako ng batat sa matandano, 
kscuaia da Uwcho da Manila sa Dulong-bayan (aba- 
nida Rtxal ngayon). May 23 taong gulang ako noon 
nang durugin ni almiranta Togo ang kukbong do got 
ng Kutia sa oantog na digmaan sa kipot ng Tusima 
noong ilea 27 ng Mayo, 1905, na ang iwing kakalaga- 
ban ay ginugunita ngayon, Araw ng Hukbong Dagat. 

Nabagbag ang damdamin dahil paRbkasa sa 
pogkakaisa ng kulay, ang karamihon sa mga nag-oo- 
aral sa Maynila, lalo na ang na so aming pooralan na 
m diwa ay siyang mga Rdar ng bagong kosiglokon ay 
naging pawang maka-haponos. tea ako so mga so- 
muboybay no lipos ng molosokH sa takbo ng dig- 
maang iyon na pati ang kokaurtting panggugol kong 
tinatanggap buhat sa amin ay ibinibili ko ng mgo 
pahayagan. And El Ranocimionto ay pangunohing 
pakayagan noon. Dahil sa koholagokang moo a ring 
ibunga ng dig ma ang ito ukol so mga taga SflJogan 
ay ipinagbunyi ang bawa't tagumpoy ng kopooas na 
wari ay amin ding tagumpay. 

(Ang hukbong dagat ng Rusia ay gumawa ng ma- 
habang paglalayag to Silangan, koya si almiranta To- 
go ay nalcapoghandang mobuti ng boiak upong koho- 
rapin ang 31 pangdimang dagat ng ruso so itang

mang dagat ng Rusia ay na koposok sa daungan ng 
Vladivostok, natambad tana sa pangbobomba ng mgo 
ruso ang mga boyboying walang tanggufan ng Hapon, 
samantalang ang mga hukbong kaponos sa Mantsuria 
sy maaaring nongomotoy sa gutom, tapogko't hindi 
makakukuka ng mga kaitangan to saritmg lupain. Na-

a dilapidated five-centavo note? ' Tha 
cost of your funeral — /ad so unappre- 
ciated by you — wiM help hundreds tide 
it over for a day to prepara them for 
the next dey's struggle. 

But wa have wandered Info a grave- 
yard from Lady PungoTs mora cheer- 
ing company. 

Wa must here remind those whose 
memory may need refreshing that Lady 
Puhgol, who has been unjustly com- 
pered with as, comes of a noble line. 
As a tin* of nobility is conferred upon 
a few humans and their families be- 
cause of a worthy deed or an act of 
heroism which alavatas thair fallows 
above their mora animality, so has tha 
Lady won har title with one heroic 
gesture by har grendsire whose proud 
name sha bears. The eider Puhgol was 
nobia. though has looks concealed hat 
nobility. Ha, was hard working, too, and 
patient and unpretentious; therefore, 
often the victim of indignities and ' 
abasert inflicted by men and beasts 
about him — a* of. which the lordly 
cerabeo supported with manful for- 
titude as is the wont of generous being*. 

Oaa fine morning, as this nobia cree- 



i HI 4 

few har wa n ts, how quiet har ma nn ers, 
though her badk di ielow s of much eie- 
oertce! She mokes little noise at di n ner, 
never pkts- her teeth in public or in 

private. 

How many of us impatient children 
of 'heftow pains can support a life for- 
ever tied with a rope to some static 
tree or stump; or to a plow or harrow 
which we must pul while a fui-sbad man 
oc-as+onaly sits atop our rump! Born 
under the <ame tropic sky. how many 
of as can withstand tha noonday heat! 
Or. hevinq no eleqent dresses and shoes, 
how would we adjust our life to a robe 
of caked mud! And. fmefty. having 
done ol the work which man of old used 
to do alone with their bare hands, sup- 
oose we were butchered *o satisfy a 
momentary craving at the expense of 



fields, ha was provoked bayond en- 
durance, alas! Other animals may lose 
thair tamper often and survive to Iota 
it again, bat a carabao gats mad only 
once. Old Pahgof ran amuck, goring 
everything that got in his way info 
eternity, and finally ending up, by ram- 
ming tha stout trunk of an aged moiave. 
Need we say that, in tha impact, one 
of his horns broto % oyejtfaT — and 
gave name to his nobia descent even 
to this day in tha seventeenth year of 
Showe? m that oner decisive act ha 
has earned for his kind tha respect of 
aft those about him. tha loss of one 
hom having become the symbol of pro- 
test against ell indignities and a warn-

at attention near her place by strains on 
the piano.

AtiAINST the will and the In -I i"«l^- 
in. hi or the vast majority of Filipinos, 
tin- country tins been forced into tin- 
tircatcr Ka»t Asia War. Thousands of 
yoni friends and relatives were draftexl 
int.. the ITSAKFK. The "seorcbed 
eartli" tactics re*ortcd to b\ the Amer- 
ican ■ .nnmmi. I reduced thousands ol 
•Your homes to ashe*, raxed whole towns 
to i he ground, and ruined your fruit- 
ful harvest. For nil these misfortunes, 
we have nothing but the deepest syui- 
iwilin . 

today, a.-tunl lighting is fortunately 
over, snd ihis country enters the is-uck! 
ol reconstruction, economic ami .spirit- 
ual. Vou take a new philosophy of lite, 
a nun outlook, turning from Western 
materialism and the selfish Individ Holis- 
tic point Of view to more Oriental ami, 
therefore, mora Filipino ideals. Above 
all, you leave tli< status of a mere Amer- 
ican territory to Income a more dignified 
meinhci ol the Greater Fast Asia Co- 
Prosperity Sphere. 

Hegardiug the pain und difficulty of 
reconstruction, 1 wish to take you ha.k 
to September 1, 1023, to experience with 
me the >ad sights wrought by that his- 
toric calamity which in a few minute.-, 
rocked Tokyo and Yokohama mid en- 
Mid Mi Ilia entire /.me m charred de- 
solation. A hundred thousand lives were 
separated bj death ami confusion. Com- 
pared to III. losSCS in this Tokyo earth- 
quake, your mnt. -rial losses are almost 
nil. 

Vet, even before the smoke lind clear- 
ed away in Tokyo, the Japanese people, 
with nu indomitable spirit Hint msgui- 
fie<l the iucag\>i material resources nt 
their command, pushed throimh tin- 
work of reebust ruction. And in less 
thau ten years, Tokyo was rebuilt on a 
grander s«-nle, stouter, statelier, i>coplc<l 
with nearly seven million strong. 

Here in the 1'liilippincs, the people 
can no doubt achieve a similar feat. 
From your misfortunes and losses in this 
war, you may rise by yonr own deter- 
mination and, upon the rains of the 
scorched esrth policy, you esn build s 
New Philippines — thns converting s mis- 
fortune into a blessing. 

I have very high hopes about the 
capabilities of the Filipinos in turning 



this war ••» I heir advantage. Since the. 
occupation, I have observed many J*!i- 
pinos rnpidl.v changing their Work aodl 
their wn> of life. In the city ol O i s nflM 
Manila, lor instance, I notice that the 
jM-ople have In-come more indiist ruaas,] 
growing twenty-tour hundred vegetable- 
-aniens, fishing in the rivers and «■»!«•- 
i os, chopping fin- wood, ami pcrlorm- 
ing all sorts of productive ami nsefnl 
tasks hitherto done only by a very limit . 
ed lew. They have be c ame more at*riotis. 
more earnest, more hottest with lil*. 
There is no doubt that they show a mark- 
ed tendency to cope with the new sitna- 
tion and achieve more than they nave - 
• done in the past. Through your hard- 
ship, you In-comc stouter, stronger, 
more fortified to coi*- with greater dil- 
llrulties; you beeouM morally firm, fill- 
ed fls you are with greater courage and 
confidence in yourselves. Through all 
these darkness, you can »ev with clarity 
the bright ray ot hope tbat shines ahead. 

The Philippines was ruled by hurope 
and Aim-tycu lor over lour hundred 
yedrV;. Through these centuries, neither 
Spain nor America could completely eon. 
vert the Filipinos into Occidentals, This 
is because the Filipinos' are, deep wiUuu 
them. Oriental, fend only Western ex- 
ternally. But as a member ol the Co- 
Prosperity Sphere, and properly und. r- 
staudillg the new ideology and correctly 
interpreting it in act and attitude, the 
Filipinos will in a lew years In- a worthy 
and fuHfledgcd member of the Great 
Fust Asiatic- lamily. 

In order to attain your objective* ta 
In-come au independent nation, 1 urge 
every Filipino to do his part aecordiag 
to his best ability. In the teachings' ol 
the Zen s.-et iii Buddhism is show,, tse 
In-st way to perform a ta^k iu the worm 
RASIKU— literally, "worthy of". This 
can apply to all things and activities. 
Jf a nobis man shows great nubility, 
he has, done a deed "worthy ol " his 
kind. If a physician cures a serious ail- 
ment or upholds the ethics of his pro- 
fession, his performance is RASIKU. 
Thus, every Filipino can do well by aa- 
derstanding the intention or purpose of 
his setivity to tbs best of his compre- 
hension, then performing bis task— be 
he farmer, house-builder, priest, mer- 
chant, or soldier — always to his utmost 
ability, for the good of all. 



per their orders, never shout them. They 
make no fuss, unlike many customers 
who find fault with the tab/eelotb, 
think the wine too weak, or the ice too 
much, and make the most of it. The 
soldiers pisi take their sests, give their 
orders, dunk silently, linger a while to 
watch the dancers, then leave. They 
seldom Lave me a tip, but I like them. 
The way they return my how makes me 
feel proud ol my lowly job. When an

occasional officer tips me, it is as libe- 
ral as sny people can do it, if not bet- 
ter." 

A salesgirl iu a drygoods store be- 
lieves the Jspanese soldiers are thought- 
ful family men. They buy silk gsr- 
menta for women, and shoes, belts snd 
hats for children. "Often, they ask me 
to stand close to them!" relates the 
salesgirl, "take in my measure with 
their eyes, then decide what aixe of 
< oats, dresses or unmentionables ihey 
would buy. They have a flair for cheap- 
er things of utility, and seem to bate 
expensive luxuries." Then she adds, "I 
imagine thnt my husband, if he were 
away t«x>, would pick the same kind of 
gifts for me. Tbat is, if I had s hus- 
band." 

.Manila eochertx in the past have been 
known to succeed as opiwrtimists. When 
it showered, and there were crowds of 
prospect i vo customers, ctx-herog could 
charge thrice as much as they should, 
without a qualm. To Japanese soldiers, 
they can't do that. A eoebero from Re- 
qwesensi thinks trailing with them is a 
very unpredictable business. Ones he 
met with soldiers oft on s lark st the
