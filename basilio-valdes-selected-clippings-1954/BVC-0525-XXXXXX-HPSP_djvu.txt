THE BULLSEYE 



Monday, May 3, 1951 



The President I 
Does it Again 



President Magsaysay has once 
more proven that he has the wel- 
fare of the “poor” at heart. 

Some three weeks ago the 
White Cross and the Philippine 
Tuberculosis Society which, in the 
past, have been divldiing their 
charity races equally between the 
Philippine Racing’ Club and the 
Manila Jockey Club, decided to 
hold all their races in the future 
Jin the premises of the Manila 
Jockey Club in San Lazaro for 
the simple reason that their 
earnings in San Lazaro were as 
much as 70% greater than their 
earnings when runnig* their cha- 
rity races in ,Sta. Ana. In the 
case of the Tuberculosis Society, 
for example, their earnings in 
San Lazaro have been as much 
as half a million pesos greater 
than their earnings in Sta. Ana 
during the last few years. Ob- 
viously, the Society could not af- 
ford to continue subsidizing the 
Sta. Ana track by holding* half 
of their races there. 

It so happens, however, that 
two prominent Nacionalistas — 
one a Senator and the other a 
Congressman — are members of 
the Philippine Racing Club's 
Board of Directors. Strangely, 
enough, these two Nacionalistas 
do not own enough shares to 
elect themselves in the Board. 
The Sta. Ana track is controlled 
by Dr. A. P. Reyes and members 
of his family, but with the votes 
of Dr. Reyes these two promi- 
nent Najcionalis’tas were elected 
to the Board. It is needless to 



say that these two politicians are 
expected to show their gratitude 
by exercising ' their influence- 
When the White Cross ap- 
proached the Games and Amuse- 
ments Board (GAB) for a permit 
to hold their scheduled race on 
Saturday, April 10, 1954, the GAB 
informed them that, according to 
an order from Malacahang signed 
by Asst. Executive Secretary 
Quema, the charitable institutions 
must diVi-je their races equally 
between the two racing clubs ope- 
rating in or rear Manila and 
that since the last race of the 
White Cross was held in San La- 
zaro, the next on e must be held 
in Sta Ana. The application of 
the Tuberculosis Society for their 
race scheduled on April 11, 19o4, 
met the same fate. 

When Secretary Araneta, hus- 
band of Victoria Araneta who is 
President of* the White Cross 
called the attention of Asst. Exe- 
cutive Secretary Quema to the 
fact that, under the law, charita- 
ble institutions are not compelled 
to divide their races between the 
two racing clubs operating in or 
nearManila, Mr. Quema wrote 
Chairmen Nieto of the GAB re- 
voking his previous order and 
saying that the White Cross may 
hold its April 10th race in San 
Lazaro as requested. For reasons 
which wo do not know, 
however, Chairman Nieto 
instead of issuing the 
vurmit to the White Cross as ap- 
plied for, went to Malacahang 
and Executive Secretary Castro, 
thereupon, revoked Asst. Execu- 
tive Secretary Quema's order re- 
scinding his (Quema's) instruc- 
tions. Thus, both the White Cross 
and the Tuberculosis Society ra- 
f'p-f; scheduled for April 10th and 
11th, 954, respectively had to be 
held in Sta. Ana. The results 
were as expected. The income 
(Continued on page 7) 



5 THE PRESIDENT... < 

(Continued from page 2) 

which each institution received 
was but a fraction of what they 
would have earned if the races 
had been held in San Lazaro. 
Thus, the two institutions lost 
many thousands of pesos because 
of Executive Secretary Castro's 
order. 

All this happened without the 
knowledge of President Magsay- 
say who was at the time absent 
from Manila. Upon his return 
the officials of the charitable ins- 
titutions which had fared . so bad- 
'y in Santa Ana laid the facts 
before him. The President, quick 
to size up the situation and to do 
justice to the poor who depend on 
the earnings of these charitable 
institutions thereupon, imme- 
diately informed the GAB that 
each charitable institutions in en- 
titled to determine for itself 
vVre they want to hold their 
respective races. Undoubtedly 
President Magsaysay realizes that 
the Board of Directors of the 
charitable institutions know best 
bow to manage their respective 
activities and that on matters 
that concern the sick, the poor, the 
destitute and the children there 
must be no intermeddling by Ma- 
lacahang underlings, and much 
’ess, by certain members of Con- 
gress.

PU ERNESTO PEL ROSARIO 



In this country, the act of 
charity has to be given an in- 
centive in the form r>f returns 
to the giver. Hence, the 
sweepstakes, benefit movie pre- 
mieres, fashion shows, beau- 
ty contests, musical extrava- 
ganzas, etc., etc. 

Some of the biggest charity 
fund raising events are the 
horse races for the benefit of 
the Philippine Tuberculosis 
Society and the Whitp Cross. 
Thus, millions of pesos have 
been raised by these institu- 
tions to carry on their worthy 
cause. 

Considering how these two 
organizations have been con- 
ducted above board and the 
results they have achieved, 
there is no quarrel over giv- 
ing them every ^possible op- 
portunity to raise the funds 
with which to carry on. Even 
if we may have reservations 
as to the necessity of tying up 



the sincere belief that the in- 
come which we would earn in 
each club would be more or 
less the same. 

“During the last five years, 
however, our records show 
that the earnings from races 
held in Santa Ana have been 
P505,000 less than the income 
which we have obtained from 
an equal number of races in 
San Lazaro. 

“Our Board of Directors 
lias, therefore, decided to hold 
all future races in San Laza- 
ro. The resulting increase in 
our revenue (about P100,000 
each year) will obviously be- 
nefit the many thousands of 
tubercular patients- who de- 
pend on us for help.” 

Speaking for the White 
Cross, Mrs. Victoria Araneta, 
president, similarly defined 
the position of her organiza- 
tion. She said that the earn- 
ings at Santa Ana were from

THE MANILA TIMES 



Tn$ present law is good enough 

Tlle Philippine Tuberculosis Society, the White 
Cross and other charitable institutions are circulat- 
ing- separate appeals which in very plain terms ask 
Congress to disapprove House Bill No. 2053' on the 
ground that its passage would considerably decrease 
the income which annually goes to these institutions 
from charity races. 

The law which governs these charity races does 
not compel any of these institutions to hold these 
benefits in specifically listed racing clubs. Such a 
limitation was deemed unnecessary, because its au- 
thors recognized the' fact that fund-raising was the 
objective and not the patronage of any one track 
The new bill would compel these institutions to hold 

,;t th ^ races in one club ’ ancl the other half in that 
ol the other organization. This would be fair enough 
were it not for the fact the new arrangement is be- 
mg unanimously protested by charitable institutions 
on the completely valid ground that receipts would 
be critically reduced. Experience has shown that 
the receipts in one club are invariably insufficient 
to meet minimum needs. 

*?• bo P e that the appeal will be considered 
“L tbe hght in which it has been projected by the 
affected institutions. J

I NDIVIDUAL SENATORS have been bombarded with 
photostats of letters from Dr. Basilio J. Valdes, 
president of the Philippine Tuberculosis Society, and Mrs. 
Victoria L. de Araneta, president of the White Cross. 
These weapons have been found to be very effective 
against Manila Congressman Angel Castano’s bill No. 
2053 providing that charity races pertaining to the two 
charitable institutions be equally divided and held at the 
Manila Jockey club and the Philippine Racing club. 

The Philippine Tuberculosis Society and the White Cross 
are two organizations now taking charge o£ combating tuber- 
culosis which claims no less than 30,000 lives annually. The 
former takes care of adult cases while the latter confines poor 
and indigent children in its hospital. Dr. Valdes alleges that 
his society will be deprived of at least P100,000 annually as 
proceeds from charity races if the Castano bill becomes a law. 
Mrs. Araneta estimates that the income from charity races, if 
they are to be held in the Philippine Racing club, will be less 
by 60 to 70 per cent than the income of such races if staged at 
the San Lazaro hippodrome. 

Congressman Castano, on the other hand, has appealed to 
individual senators that his measure is not really intended to 
discriminate against charitable organizations but simply to pro- 1 
tect the rights of the two racing clubs as provided in their 
respective franchises. It would not be good for one club to j 
monopolize the racing business for which the government has 
granted them franchises for their operation and protection. 

The officials the two lyeneficiary institutions , however. / 
iave presented effectively their eases the cause of charity for 
he benefit of the t uberculous people and the poor and indigent I 
hildren. Certainly , these organizations deserve all the funds 
i at the government can give to them directly or indirectly, 
nd the charity races are one fertile source by which the gov - 
mment is Indirectly helping their worthy cause. 

The Philippine Racing club which boats of a better track and 
mcrete buildings suitable for this "king of sports and the 
3orts of kings" should start inquiring into the real causes why • 
cannot compete with the Manila Jockey club in matters of 
icome. Its officials must answer the query as to why racing 
ms would prefer to go to San Lazaro instead of Santa Ana. 

The PRC can compete effectively with the MJC. There 
oust be something wrong with the PR,C public and press rela- 
ions which causes the failure of this club to attract as many 
People as MJC. Maybe there are no suitable transportation 
[acuities for the racing enthusiasts or no adequate security 
tor those who hit substantial dividends in the daily double and 
Have races. 

President Magsaysay has decided that the boards of directors 
of the PTS and WC may decide for themselves where to hold 
their charity races. It is but natural for these boards to stage 
their races in the track that gives them the most income for the 
benefit of the thousands of tuberculous people and the poor and 
indigent children who turn to these institutions for assistance. 

PR.C stockholders are mostly successful businessmen and 
financial executives. It is high time for* them to tax their

Many Vs. Few 

A bill which would in effect deprive two charit- 
able organization of substantial parts of their 
income is awaiting passage in Congress. From the 
initial success of its sponsor, Rep. Angel Castano of 
Manila, it appears headed for approval in the lower 
house, from which it is expected to reach and be ap- 
proved in the Senate during the last days of the cur- 
lent session. But all right-minded legislators would 
no doubt want to block this measure if they knew 
what it means to the fight for the eradication of tu- 
berculosis in this country. 

It is not surprising that this bill, H. No. 2053 
should have been calendared and approved on second 
reading without the usual publicity. For if the en- 
,| ea concerned had been invited to a hearing or the 
bill had been discussed at any length in the House, 
,ieie is no doubt that it would have been snowed 
under by a torrent of opposition, not only from the 
public but from the lawmakers as well. 

The purpose of the bill is to compel the Philippine 
Tuberculosis Society and the' White Cross to hold 
half of their benefit races at a particular race track 
although doing so would reduce the PTS income by 
t'100,000 a year and cut the already modest income 
of the White Cross by 60 to 70 per cent. 

When the two organizations decided to hold their 
lacing days at the San Lazaro track since January 
of last year, they discovered that this boosted their 
income by the above-stated figures. This was fol- 
lowed by attempts in some auarters to compel them 
to hold half of the races at Santa Ana, but nothing 
came of this because these institutions are authorized 
to choose the site they deem best for their benefit 
races. Finally the intervention of President Magsay- 
say was sought, and he upheld the respondents. 

After this, there was no recourse but to compel 
the boards of directors to divide the racing days be- 
tween the two racetracks, bv passing an amendment 
to the law. Thus the bill in auestion is not only a 
form of legislation intended to benefit a small group 
but one which would adversely affect thousands of 
people, tuberculosis victims, at the same time 

Finally, it is worthy of note that the sponsor of 
this measure is precisely the same congressman who

PRC PRESIDENT A. P. REYES is shown stressing: u point in 
yesterday’s meeting; of horse owners, trainers and jockeys on 
the vital issue of equi table distribution of charity race skeds 
at San Lazaro and Sta. Ana hippodromes.

Three main organizations di- 
rectly concerned with the hand- 
ling of races at the San Lazaro 
and Sta. Ana hippodromes met 
'yesterday afternoon to frame a 
resolution asking for an equitable 
distribution of charity race sche- 
dules in both ovals.

deliberations. 

The Philippine Racing Club 
yesterday made known its stand 
on the controversial issue of the 
allocation of charity racing dates 
for both ovals. The White Cross 
has initiated the move to exclude 
these races from Sta. Ana in 
preference to San Lazaro, for 
reasons of economy and the 
alleged difference in net receipts 
in favor of San Lazaro.

OPEN LETTER 



TO PRESIDENT MAGSAYSAY 
AND CONGRESS 



THE WHITE CROSS, INC. AND THE PHILIPPINE TUBER- 
CULOSIS SOCIETY HAVE MADE CLAIMS THAT THEY STAND 
TO LOSE A SIZEABLE PART OF THEIR EXPECTED INCOMES 
FROM CHARITY RACES IF HALF OF THESE ARE HELD AT THE 
PHILIPPINE RACING CLUB. 

TO THESE CLAIMS WE HAVE MADE INCOME GUARANTEES 
ON FLAT RATES AND PERCENTAGE BASIS IN THE CASE OF 
THE WHITE CROSS BASED ON THE TOTAL INCOME OF 
P80,000 REALIZED FROM THE MANILA JOCKEY CLUB IN 
1953, WITH AN OPTION TO CHOOSE WHICHEVER IS FAV- 
ORABLE AS FOLLOW: 7 . A FIXED INCOME OF 920,000 TO 
THE WHITE CROSS FOR A WHOLE-DAY AND HALF-DAY RA- 
CING SCHEDULE OR — 2. SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE NET 
EARNINGS FOR EACH WHOLE-DAY AND HALF-DAY RACING 
SCHEDULE, WITH AN OPTION TO CHOOSE WHICHEVER IS 
FAVORABLE TO THE WHITE CROSS. 

WE BELIEVE THAT THESE PROPOSALS TO T H E WHITE 
CROSS WOULD REASONABLY MATCH WHATEVER IN- 
COMES, CONTINGENT OR ACTUAL, THAT IT EXPECTS TO 
RECEIVE FROM SCHEDULED RACES AT THE MANILA JOC- 
KEY CLUB. 





m THE CASE OF THE PHILIPPINE TUBERCULOSIS SOCIE- 
TY, WE HAVE ALSO MADE THE FOLLOWING PROPOSALS 
BASED ON THE PREVIOUS INCOMES MADE BY THE SAID 
CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIO N FROM SCHEDULED RACES 

HELD AT SAN LAZARO FOR A PERIOD OF EIGHT YEARS 

FROM 1946 TO 1953: 1. A FLAT RATE GUARANTEE OF *21,- 

000 FOR A WHOLE-DAY AND A HALF-DAY RACING SCHED- 
ULE. THIS GUARANTEE HAS BEEN ARRIVED AT TO MATCH 
THE INCOMES DERIVED BY THE P.T.S. AT SAN LAZARO 
FOR A PERIOD OF EIGHT YEARS. THE NET INCOME OF THE 
P.T.S. COMPUTED ANNUALLY UNDER. THIS GUARANTEE 
WOULD AMOUNT TO P126,Q00 FOR SIX SCHEDULED RACES 

AT SANTA ANA PARK. 

' V 

WE BELIEVE THAT THESE INCOME GUARANTEES ARE 
SUFFICIENT TO BELIE THE ARGUMENT OF EXPECTED LOSS- 
ES FOR BOTH THE WHITE CROSS, INC. AND THE PHILIP-

EXORABLE CONSEQUENCES OF CHANNELLING CHA RB TY

A VITAL ISSUE FOR LOCAL RACING 



The ordinary racing: fan may not know it but there is a power 
struggle going 1 on right under his nose, an issue that involves 
two racing hippodromes— San Lazaro and Sta. Ana. 

The issue centers on the recent move to channel all charity 
races of the White Cross and the Philippine Tuberculosis Society 
to San Lazaro, to the exclusion of Sta. Ana. It is a vital issue be- 
cause if it is decided in favor of San Lazaro, it would mean the 
closing of Sta. Ana, the death Knell of an institution that can 
rightly claim a good share of racing history here. 

The struggle dates back to as early as this year when the 
White Cross decided to hold all its charity races at the MJC, alleg- 
uig that the difference in earnings between the two ovals favors 
decision, of course, upsets a long standing practice 
of holding charity races in both racing hippodromes on an equal 
basis. It was only fair, it was thought then, that both clubs should 
en J°y an equal share of the bonanza from these charity races. 

The issue became more patent with the introduction of a bill 
In Congress which would nake it a matter of law to apportion 
equally the charity races of the White Cross and the Tuberculosis 
Society. Naturally, the proponents of the other side of the issue 
want this bill killed, either at the Senate or at Malacanang when 
at comes up for signing by the President if it passes the Senate. 

The Philippine Racing Club has just recently announced a 
willingness and a readiness to match the incomes on charity races 
from San Lazaro. These guarantees look substantial and pose as 
the strongest counterargument against charity officials involved 
who claim that the Sta. Ana races would mean less revenues to 
them, contingent or actual. 

However, if the issue is decided in favor "of San Lazaro, it 
would mean for certain these in local racing: 

W T . ,le c . losure Sta. Ana hippodrome, if the attitude of 
PRC officials is to be taken seriously. This would mean the live- 
lihood of a considerable number of people directly involved in 
racing— horse owners, trainers, jockeys and breeders. 

(2) The diminution in revenues for the Games and Amuse- 
ment Board whose existence is parHy financed by its share of 
racing incomes from both ovals. 

W The fostering of a MONOPOLY IN RACING, assuming 
that Sta. Ana would close, or would merge with San Lazaro, or 
would be bought out by San Lazaro. This needs no argument for 
it would be stressing file obvious. The evils attendant to a mono- 
poly are well known. 

Philippine Racing Club officials have made an appeal to a 
J^nse of equity, fair play and justice and argue that they have 
knocked down the main argument of a discrepancy in revenues. 

I think it is only fair and just that they be given a chance to 
prove their side. THEIRS IS A GRIM FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL. 
It- would redound to the good of racing in this country that this 
vital issue in the “sport of kings” be decided in their favor.

(No races were held in the P.R.C. in 1953). 



It is noteworthy that Dr. A. P. Reyes gives the impressive figure of P20,000.00 
followed by the phrase that this guaranteed income is for a whole day and a half day 
racing schedule. The Philippine Tuberculosis Society in a letter dated March 15, 

1954 informed Dr. A. P. Reyes that it would be amenable to holding- half of its 
races in Santa Ana if their club would guarantee the Society an income of P20,000.00 
for a whole day’s racing and P12, 000.00 for a half day's racing — or a total of Pol., 000 
for a day and half . This figure of P32, 000 is still less than the income the TB society 
derives by conducting a day and half racing schedule at the Manila Jockey Club. L> i . 
A. P. Reyes was also informed that the TB Society would appreciate an answer on or 
before March 31, 1954. Up to this late date this letter remains unanswered. 



In their public letter, the National Horse Owners Assn, and the Philippine Hoise 
Trainers Mutual Aid Assn. Inc., volunteered the opinion that to allow the char- 
itable organizations the freedom to choose the club wherein they will conduct then 
charity races constitutes monopoly. Before Santa Ana race track was established in 
1937 all Tuberculosis Society and Sweepstakes races were held in San Lazaro. Ine 
Manila Jockey Club, then had a monopoly on all the charity races since it was the only 
race track in existence. San Lazaro then never charged a centavo for the use of its 
track! A monopoly cannot exist so long as the societies are free to use the track 
that gives them the most income. We believe that the charitable societies should be 
given complete liberty in selecting the club wherein they are to conduct their races. 
If the law were to compell the societies to hold their affairs at determinate tracks, 
then, the societies would be at the mercy of the clubs. The clubs could charge them 
anv amount of rent and the societies would still be compelled to hold their laces in 
those tracks. A law obliging the charitable societies to conduct their races m certain 
tracks is contrary to the principles of free enterprise and would negate competition 
which is the life blood of our way of life and the only insurance of high quality ser- 
vice that the public can have. 

It is also noteworthy that horse owners and trainers derive their income m direct 
proportion to the gross betting. Since it is an uncontestable fact that one Club a - 
ways has higher gross betting than the other Club, we, therefore, cannot understand 
why the Horse Owners Assn, and the Philippine Plorse Trainers Mutual Aid Assn., 
should come out for the approval of H. B. 2053 which seeks to compell charity or- 
ganizations to conduct their races at determinate tracks. This is contrary to the best 
interest of horse-owners and trainers. 

The Philippine Tuberculosis Society and the White Cross wish to reiterate the 
fact that its sole guiding interest in his matter is the income derived from the races. 
We have neither preference, prejudice nor predilection for any track in existence.

It is noteworthy that Dr. A. P. Reyes gives the impressive figure of P20, 000.00 fol- 
lowed by the phrase that this guaranteed income is for a whole day and a half day 
racing schedule. The Philippine Tuberculosis Society in a letter dated March 15, 1954 
informed Dr. A. P. Reyes that it would be amenable to holding half of its races in 
Santa Ana if their club would guarantee the Society an income of P20, 000.00 for a 

t vfiole day's racing and JP12, 000.00 for a half day's racing — or a total of P32,000.00 
fora day and half. This figure of P32, OOO is still less than the income the T B society 
derives by conducting a day and half racing schedule at the Manila Jockey Club. Dr. 
A. P. Reyes was also informed that the TB Society would appreciate an answer on 
or before March 31, 1954. Up to this late date this letter remains unanswered. 

In their public letter, the National Horse Owners Assn, and the Philippine Horse 
Trainers and Mutual Aid Assn. Inc., volunteered the opinion that to allow the charit- 
able organizations the freedom to choose the club wherein they will conduct their cha- 
rity races constitutes monopoly. Before Santa Ana race track was established in 1937 
all Tuberculosis Society and Sweepstakes races were held in San Lazaro. The Manila 
Jockey Club, then had a monopoly on all the charity races since it was the only race 
track in existence. San Lazaro then never charged a centavo for the use of its track! 
A monopoly cannot exist so long as the societies are free to use the track that gives 
them the most income. We believe that the charitable societies should be given com- 
nlete liberty in selecting the club wherein they , are to conduct their races. If the 
law were to compel the societies to hold their affairs at determinate tracks, then, the 
societies would be at the mercy of the clubs. The clubs could charge them any amount 
of rent and the societies would still be compelled to hold their races in those tracks. 
A law obliging the charitable societies to conduct their races in certain tracks is con- 
trary to the principles of free enterprise and would negate competition which is the life 
blood of our way of life and the only insurance of high quality service that the public 
can have. 

It is also noteworthy that horse owners and trainers derive their income in direct 
proportion to the gross betting. Since it is an uncontestable fact that one club always 
has higher gross betting than the other club, we, therefore, cannot understand why 
the Horse Owners Assn, and the Philippine Horse Trainers Mutual Aid Assn., should 
come out for the approval of H.B. 2053 which seeks to compel charity organizations 
to conduct their races? at determinate tracks. This is contrary to the best interest of 
horse-owners and trainers. 

The Philippine Tuberculosis Society and the White Cross wish to reiterate the fact 
that its sole guiding interest in this matter is the income derived from the races. We 
have neither preference, prejudice nor predilection for any track in existence.

It is noteworthy that Dr. A. P. Reyes gives the impressive figure of P20, 000.00 followed by the phrase 
that this guaranteed income is for a whole day and a half day racing schedule. The Philippine Tuberculosis 
Society in a letter dated March 15, 1954 informed Dr. A. P. Reyes that it would be amenable to holding half 
of its races in Santa Ana if their club would guarantee the Society an income of P20, 000.00 for a whole 
day’s racing and P12, 000.00 for a half day’s racing — or a total of P32, 000.00 for a day and half. This fig- 
ure of P32,000 is still less than the income the TB society derives by conducting a day and half racing 
schedule at the Manila Jockey Club. Dr. A. P. Reyes was also informed that the TB Society would ap- 
preciate an answer on or before March 31, 1954. Up to this late date this letter remains unanswered. 

In their public letter, the National Horse Owners Assn, and the Philippine Horse Trainers and Mu- 
tual Aid Assn. Inc., volunteered the opinion that to allow the charitable organizations the freedom to 
choose the club wherein they will conduct their charity races constitutes monopoly. Before Santa Ana 
race track was established in 1937 all Tuberculosis Society and Sweepstakes races were held in San Lazaro. The 
Manila Jockey Club, then had a monopoly on all the charity races since it was the only race track in ex- 
istence. San Lazaro then never charged a centavo for the use of its track! A monopoly cannot exist so 
long as the societies are free to use the track that gives them the most income. We believe that the char- 
itable societies should be given complete liberty in selecting the club wherein they are to conduct their 
races. If the law were to compel the societies to hold their affairs at determinate tracks, then, the socie- 
ties would be at the mercy of the clubs. The clubs could charge them any amount of rent and the so- 
cieties would still be compelled to hold their races in those tracks. A law obliging the charitable socie-

THE PTS GIVES ITS SIDE OF RnCISiG ISSUE 

Vico President Basilic J. Valdes of the Philippine Tuberculosis 
Society yesterday wrote me the side of that body on the ragin 
issue regarding* the allocation of charity races hi San Eazaro and 



Sta. Ana clubs. 



I am publishing* it here in full for the benefit of all racing 
fans and readers who keenly follow the trends and ramifications 
of this vital issue to local racing*. 

_ ^ May 17, 1954 

The Sportscope Editor 
The Evening News 
Sir: 

I have read your column in the May 17th issue. I am assum- 
ing that you will welcome tiie true facts on the issue raised by 
House Bill No. 2053 — hence, this letter. 

1) — It is not true that if all charity races are transferred to 
San Lazaro the livelihood of horse-owners, jockeys, trainers, joc- 
keys and breeders will be adversely affected. On the. contrary, 
their earnings will increase because the records definitely show 
that betting* and public attendance in San Eazaro are much greater 
than in Sta. Amv 

2) — It Is not true that the GAB’s revenue will likewise de- 
crease. On the contrary, they will increase because the San Eazaro 
track will be holding races on every clay allowed by law and the 
total betting* will be greater than when racing days are divided - 
between the two clubs. I might add that the taxes collected by 
the government will likewise increase. Actually, the Bureau of 
Internal Revenue has already suggested to the charitable institu- 
tion that all their races be held in San Eazaro in order to enable 
the Bureau to collect more taxes. 

3) — Even* if the San Eazaro track is the only one remaining 
in operation should Sta. Ana be closed, there is nothing to tear. 
Until 1937 there was only jne racetrack in Manila, namely, San 
Eazaro. Between 1937 and 1939 all charity races were held only 
in Sta. Ana. During the first year after liberation all charity 
races were likewise held in Sta. Ana because the charitable insti- 
tutions believed that they ould obtain more revenues there. No 
evil results followed from this. 

4) — The former practice of holding charity races in both ra- 
cing hipoodromes was being followed only because it was believed 
that the income which we would obtain from both tracks would 
be more or less the same. Our sole guiding interest is the income 
derived from Hie races which we need to finance our work. When 

j the difference in earnings becomes as much as P1Q9, 000.00 a year, 

| we believe if is our duty to move all our races to the better man- 
aged track. 

Enclosed herewith is a copy of the memorandum, dated Feb- 
ruary 8, 1954, signed by Dr. Miguel Canizares of the Quezon In- 
stitute, National Treasurer Vicente Gella and the undersigned ad- 
dressed to the members of the Board of Directors ot the l J hiiip- 
pine Tuberculosis Society wherein you will find additional facts 
explaining why the Society finally decided to transfer all their 
races to San Eazaro. I urge you to read the same carefully. 

There is only one point in your article with which we are in 
agreement and that is that, before a law is passed, all the parties 
to he affected by it should he given a hearing. House Bill No. 
2053 not only will kill free competition between racetrack oper- 
ators hut it will deprive the Tuberculosis Society alone of PI 00,- 
000.00 u year income. Certainly, we should have been given a 
hearing. And yet we have been denied that aet of simple justice. 
House Bill No. 2053 was rushed through first and second reading 
in the lower house without publicity anil without giving any one 
an, opportunity to present their view. This, in itself, i:; sufficient 
reason why the hill should not now he passed. 

Very truly yours,

MANILA BULLETIN, WED., MAY 19, 1954 



WANT IB CHARITY 

RACES AT LAZAR© 



Faced with the prospects of 
losing P100,000 annually for the 
maintenance and upkeep of the 
Quezon institute and its sick in- 
mates, the Philippine Tuberculosis 
society appealed yesterday to 
President Magsaysay to allow it 
to hold all its annual horse races 
at the San Lazaro race track 
instead of the Sta. An* turf. 

Gen. Basilio J. Valdes, (ret.) 
chairman of a three-man commit- 
tee designated to study the sudden 
drop of income earned by the tu- 
berculosis society from the Phil- 
ippine Racing club in Sta. Ana, 
explained that up to 1950 the 
Philippine Tuberculosis society 
had been dividing its 25 horse 
race meetings yearly between the 
Manila Jockey Club in San Laza- 
ro and the Philippine Racing club 
in Sta. Ana because the income

THE DAILY MIRROR, FRIDAY, MAY 21, 1954 



White Cross 
President 
Resigns 



OK Of M On Charity 



tlaces Believed Cause; 
He|d Post For 17 Years 



The resignation of Mrs. Vic- 
toria Lopez Araneta from the 
presidency of the White Cross, 
Inc., a position she has held for 
17 years was expected to be an- 
nounced today. 

She was reported going over 
the final draft of her resignation 
letter addressed to the board. 

Gen. Basilio Valdes, vice pre- 
sident of the Philippine Tuber- 
culosis Society, another organi- 
zation affected by the racing 
bill, however, said he is not re- 
signing from the PTS over the 
pasage of the measure, contrary 
to earlier reports he, too, was 
quitting his posf. 

He said he is grateful to sen- 
ators who introduced the amend- 
ment requiring both the Manila 
Jockey Club and the Philippine 
Racing Club to post minimum 
guarantees. 

He said it is possible that 
Mrs. Araneta’s action was due 
to lack of opportunity by her 
to go over the detailed aspects 
of the bill. 

In a telephone interview with 
Mrs. Araneta this morning, she 
• impliedly attributed the cause 
for relinquishing the presidency 
! to her having “outgrown’' her 
usefulness in the organization. 
She stated that the White Cross 
would do well to look for a lead- 



er wh o has a better command qf 



White Cross President Resigns

the situation, referring to her 
failure to block enactment of 
H. B. 2053, which she had tried 
vainly to oppose. 

It will be recalled that the 
White Cross top head campaign- 
ed vigorously against the ap- 
proval of House Bill 2053 which 
seeks to regulate the conduct 
of horse races by apportioning 
'equally the racing days author- 
ized by law between the Philip- 



pine Racing Club and the Mani- 
la Jockey Club. 

Mrs. Araneta worked hard to 
block the passage of the bill 
contending that the proceeds in- 
tended for charity derived from 
the Philippine Racing Club, is 
comparatively lower compared 
to _ what is grossed at the Mani- 
la Jockdy Club. 

Congress passed the measure 
on the certification of Malaca- 
han.

THF. TRUTH REPlfNH _ 




THE FIGHT TO CONTROL 
HORSE-RACING HERE 



The Philippine Tuberculosis Socieety and the White Cross may 
not be too happy over the approval of the bill distributing their 
benefit races equitably between the Sta. Ana and San Lazaio 
race tracks. 

But these charitable organizations, according to a BULLS- 
EYE informant, will be greatly relieved to learn that the passage 
of that bill has prevented them from becoming the unwitting ins- 
truments in a sinister scheme of big business interests to corner 
the racetrack industry _jn the Philippine^. 



THE BULLSEYE 

idea of selling out to anybody.* 
much less the rival race track. 
They were playing on th 0 suye 
shot that after December of this 
year, theirs would be the only 
race track in operation and this 
would give them a chance to 
make up for what they had not 
been making before. 

Exploiting the fact that net 
proceeds from races held at San 
Uaaaro were larger than from 
those held at Sta. Ana, a move 
was started to have all charity 
races run at the former site. 

In view of the statistics pro- 
duced by the charity organizations 



Unknown to the general pub- 
lic, the controversial bill which 
was the subject of full-page ad- 
vertisements by the interested 
parties was actually nothing more 
than an offshoot of a battle bet- 
ween the Manila Jockey Club and 
the Philippine Pacing Club for 
control of horseracing in this 

country- 

By virtue of a law as amended 
by a presidential order, the San 
Lazaro racetrack has only up to 
December of this year in (which 
to continue in operation. 

The National Urban Planning 
Commission long ago earmarked 
the San Lazaro racetrack as re- 
sidential area. Although it is a 
much older track than the Sta. 
Ana oval, its days wer e number- 
ed. It either had to comply with 
the law and close shop, or do 
something that would keep it in 
the r horseracing business. 

For some time, there were ru- 
mors that the owners of the Ma- 
nila Jobkey Club were thinking 
of buying the Wack-Wack Gold 
and Country Club. But accord- 



ing to the BULLSEYE informant, 
Wack-Wack was not for sale. So 
the MJC owners had to think of 
something else. 

It then occurred to them, ac- 
cording to reports, that if the 
Philippine Racing Club could be 
forced into a financial corner, 
the latter’s owners might be per- 
suaded into selling out. 

And this is where the charity 
races conveniently evume in. 

As a matter of practice chari- 
ty races were divided equally 
between the two clubs. This ena- J 
bled the PRC to continue in ope- 
ration although it obviously was 
not realizing as much profits as 
the MJC. 0 

If the charity races could only 
be removed from the PRC, the. 
PRC would have to fold up. It 
would not last even up to Decem- 
ber, the deadline given to the San 
Lazaro racetrack to close up or 
• move out. 

But precisely because the PRC 
knew that th e days of the San 
Lazaro track were numbered its 
owners refused to consider the 



concerned, Malacanang was per- 
suaded to issue a* directive autho- 
rizing them to choose th e place 
where their races were to be held. 
But nobody told Malacanang of 
the desperate plight the Manila 
Jockey Club was really in. Nor 
of the move to force the PRC 
into selling out; 

But local horseowners and 
trainers, apparently, knew what 
was going on. They were as 
deeply concerned about the mat- 
ter as the clubs themselves. This 
Explains ^vhy l\ep. Angel Cas- J 
taho, although from Manila, in- 
troduced the controversial bill 
splitting charity races. 

As past president of the Na- 
tional Horse Owners and Trai- 
ners Association, Castaho became 
the logical spekesman for the in- 
terests of the horseowners. joc- 
keys, stable hands and ther per- 
sonnel and their families whose 
livelihood depended on the out- 
come of the case. 

While it may be true, accord- 
ing to a BULLSEYE informant, 
that the bill now approved by 



Congress would deprive the city 
If Manila of new revenue which 
would accrue from the holding of 
[all clarity races at the San La- 
zaro, it was argued by followers 
of Castaho that most of the peo- 
ple directly -affected were resi- 
dents of Manila. 

Moreover, it iwas pointed out 
that any advantage derived by 
the city' from non-approval of the 
measure would, at best, be tem-j 
porary inasmuch as th e Sun La- 
zaro would not be able to operate 
beyond the end of this year. 

But when the San Lazaro race j 
track closes its doors for the 
last time, a chapter in the histo- 
ry of the city of Manila would 
close forever. Manila would lose 
the distinction of being the only 
city in the whole world within 
whose boundaries a race track is 
■ allowed to operate.
