President of the Philippines

AMON MAGSAYSAY was born on August 31, 1907, 
in. Iba, Zambales, the son of Exequiel Magsaysay, 
a carpenter and successively blacksmith and school- 
teacher* While still of kindergarten age he was already 
doing unusual chores for a child his size, fetching fire- 
wood and sweeping the floor for his mother, Perfects 
del Fierro, and helping his father in the smithy. 
Schooldays were hard days for young Ramon. He received his 
elementary school education under trying: circumstances in the town 
of Castillejos, where his family had moved. He frequently walked 
22 kilometers to high school at the Zambales Academy in San 
Narciso, and as frequently cooked his own food. He was a lanky, 
shy country lad of 20 when, in 1927, he went to Manila to take up 
engineering al the University of the Philippines. He did odd jobs 
here and there, mostly as a driver, to pay for his board and lodging, 
but soon the strain told on his health and he became ill for six 
months. Upon recovering, Ramon decided to give way to his inclination 
for business and he transferred to the Jose Rizal College. In 1932, he 
marched out into the practical world with a degree of Bachelor 
of Science in Commerce. 

Starting as a mechanic in a crumbling bus company (Try Tran), 
Magsaysay injected drive and courage among his fellow -workers, held 
them Logether under extremely discouraging conditions. He rapidly 
rose to become manager of the firm and when the war broke out 
in 1941, he had transformed the company into one of the biggest 
successful transportation firms. 

This period of his lii'c was blessed with his marriage to a shy, 
pretty girl from Eataan by the name of Luz Banzon. They now 
have three children; Teresita, 19; Mil agios, 17; and Ramon, Jr., 15. 
Today, Ramon Magsaysay is profoundly grateful for the indispensable 
inspiration that is his wife. 

The war was another turning point in Ramon's life. He began 
service as a volunteer with the 31st Infantry Division Motor Pool 
under Brigadier General Blummel. Shortly before the Jail of Rata an 
in April 1942, he joined Lit. Col. Claude A. Thorpe and a handful of 
other American officers at Mt. Pinatubo; together they organized the 
Western Luzon Guerrilla Forces. Magsaysay was appointed overall 
commander of the Zambales Military District. This put him in com- 




mand of ten thousand rough, rugged men fighting for survival- The 
Japs soon put a prize on his head, so that it became necessary for 
him to keep an eye on the Japs while he was keeping alert to 
possible abuses by his own men. It was then that Magsaysay learned 
in the hard way the value of vigilance and quick decision, and the 
importance of fair play to the man who carries the gun. 

In early 1945, Magsaysay and his men led the American forces 
in the liberation of Zambales; they were subsequently recognized by 
the U. & Army as the "Magsaysay's Guerrillas." 

On February 4, 1945, Magsaysay was appointed Military Governor 
of Zambales by General Charles P. Hall of the 11th Corps which had 
liberated Zambales. He was promoted to the rank of Major on 
September 23, 1945 by order of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, and honor- 
ably discharged from the Philippine Army on February S, 1946. 

Magsaysay's life as a public servant began on April 23, 1946, when 
he was elected Representative of Zambales by the biggest majority 
in the political history of that province. In November, 1949, he was 
re-elected in another overwhelming victory. During both terms, he 
was chairman of the important National Defense Committee. During 
his second term, he was also a ranking member of the equally im- 
portant Committee on Appropriations. 

In 1948, Magsaysay made his first trip to the U. 3. as head of 
a veterans' mission and succeeded in securing the approval of the 
Roger's Bill providing for additional benefits to Filipino veterans. In 
April 1950, he was again sent to Washington to obtain military 
assistance for the Philippines. This mission he likewise accomplished 
with singular success. 

Magsaysay assumed the Defense Secretaryship on September 1, 
1950, when the Huks were at the height of their power and the fall 
of the country into Communist hands seemed imminent. He weeded 
out the army dead wood, whipped the then undisciplined armed forces 
into line, and sent them out to the mountains after the Huks in a 
series of relentless drives, employing unorthodox methods that were 
applauded and subsequently copied in other parts of the globe. At 
the same time, he won resentful, land-hungry Huks back to peaceful 
society, by providing them with land and new opportunities through 
his daring, world- famed EDCOR program, 

Magsaysay soon had die-hard Huks on the run, and by the middle 
of 1952, he had smashed the Communist- led movement into an irre- 
trievable failure, giving Asia its first locally achieved victory over 
international Communism. His brilliant record of action, honesty and 
integrity in the Department of National Defense fired the imagination 
not only of his people but of the rest of the free world as well. 



For basic reasons too well known, he resigned as Defense Secretary 
on February 28, 1953. At the Nacionalista Party national convention 
on April 12, 1953, he was nominated Presidential candidate by an 
overwhelming vote. On November 10 last, in a landslide victory 
unprecedented in Philippine politics, he was elected head of the state— the 
youngest ever to be bestowed, by popular mandate, the highest magistracy 
of the nation. 

The new President has been variously honored abroad for his 
accomplishments. When he visited the United States in 1952, San 
Francisco accorded him the biggest reception ever given to a Filipino. 
Washington awarded him the U. S. Bronze Star and the Legion of 
Merit, Degree of Commander, and New York's Fordham University 
conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Laws (Honoris Causa). 
In the same year, in Mexico, he was the keynote speaker at the Lions' 
International Convention, during which he received one of the longest 
and warmest ovations in annual international conventions. His many 
achievements have been continually acclaimed by foremost periodicals 
the world over. 

His own people have been no less lavish in their recognition of 
his unparalleled dedication to his country. He has been awarded the 
Military Merit Medal (PA); Legion of Honor, Officer Class (AFP); 
Presidential Medal for Exemplary Public Service (having been the 
youngest to be so honored) ; degree of Doctor of Laws (Honoris Causa) 
from the Quezon Colleges; and many other medals of honor and 
certificates of merit from leading universities and civic organizations. 
Earlier in Congress, his public service was distinguished by citations 
from the Congressional Press Club naming him one of the ten most 
useful congressmen for the years 1946 and 1949, and one of the 20 
outstanding congressmen for the four-year term 1946-1950. He was 
Philippines Free Press "Man of the Year" for 1950 and 1951 successively, 
and "Veteran of the Year" for 1952. 

Thus, the new President brings with him into office a world-wide 
prestige, which, together with his high personal qualities and his 
passion for social and economic advancement for the common man, 
augurs well for the Philippines the approaching day when her coveted 
place in the sun among the free nations of the world shall be secure.

ICE PRESIDENT CARLOS P. GARCIA, the favorite 
son of Bohol, was born on November 4, 1896 in the 
town of Talibon, the son of Policronio Garcia, Mayor 
and undisputed leader of Talibon until his death, and 
Ambrosia Polistico. 

Young Garcia attended the Talibon Elementary 
School, Cebu High School, Silliman University, and the 
the Philippine Law School. He was always at the head of his class 
since his primary school days until he finished his law course in 
the Philippine Law School as valedictorian, class of 1923. He passed 
the bar in the same year, placing among the first ten, notwithstanding 
the fact that he was taken ill on the day preceding the last day of the 
examinations, suffering from typhoid fever. He was the winner of 
Malcolm's four-year law course scholarship prize and of oratorical 
contests during his high school and college days. He has been 
Minority Floor Leader of the Senate since 1946, and has consistently 
been voted among the most outstanding senators from 1949 through 1953. 

Vice President Garcia has been a public school teacher for more 
than two years; six years as representative of the 3rd District of 
Bohol; nine years as Provincial Governor of his Province; and Senator 
from 1941 up to the time he was elected Vice President. He was 
a Member of the Mission to Washington for Philippine Rehabilitation 
and War Damage Claims in 1945; Delegate to the World Conference 
at San Francisco in 1945 to draft the Charter of the United Nations; 
Delegate to the Inter-parliamentary Union Conference at Dublin, 
Ireland, in 1950; and Delegate to the Southeast Asia Conference in 
Baguio in 1950. Vice President Garcia is one of our well-known 
scholars and best informed political leaders. He has made extensive 
and serious studies in philosophy, history, finance and economics. 
He is regarded as the Prince of Visayan poets today. 

Until his election as Vice President of the Philippines he was 
chairman of the following committees: Advisory Committee; Committee 
on Government Reorganization; sub-Committee on Japanese Reparations; 
and Senate Representation, Commission on Appointments. He was a 
member of the following Senate Committees: Foreign Affairs, Finance, 
Public Works, Army and Navy, Privileges and Elections, Rules, Codes, 
Justice, Presidential Committee on Japanese Reparations, and Senate 
Electoral Tribunal. 



One of his most trying experiences in life, perhaps, was during 
the Japanese occupation when for three years he was hunted by the 
Japanese soldiers for having spurned the order to surrender in May, 
1942, and a heavy price on his head was fixed by the invaders but 
he was adamant and immovable and stuck to his decision not to 
surrender. Thrice he narrowly escaped capture by the pursuing Japa- 
nese soldiers during the war. Once he was shipwrecked in 1942 in 
trying to evade capture by the Japanese but fortunately succeeded in 
dodging the enemy with his father. 

He figured prominently in the resistance movement during the 
Japanese occupation, He received a letter from President Quezon 
who was then in Washington confirming and approving the Civil 
Government of Bohol with Senator Garcia as High Adviser both 
of the Civil Government and of the resistance movement in that area. 

Vice President Garcia is a world traveler. He has not only visited 
almost every town and city in the Philippines but has traveled in 
the United States, England, Ireland, France, Switzerland, Belgium, 
Rome and other Italian Cities, Spain, and Portugal, among others, 
Aside from being a lover of books, Vice President Garcia is a 
chess player of no mean ability. 

He married Miss Leonila Dimataga of Opon, Cebu, who is a phar- 
macist by profession and by whom he has one young and charming 
daughter, Linda D, Garcia 3 now a junior in the College of Liberal 
Arts, University of the Philippines. 

At the Nacionalista Convention held on April 12, 1953, Ramon 
Magsaysay and Carlos P. Garcia were nominated by an overwhelming 
majority as the Nacionalista candidates for President and Vice President 
of the Philippines. The most decisive majority obtained by Vice 
President Carlos P. Garcia in the last election of November 10, 1953, 
is without precedent in the history of elections in the Philippines, 
It is an incontrovertible evidence of his amazing popularity. 

The distinguished record of public service of Vice President Garcia 
speaks for itself. That he will discharge the duties of his exalted office 
as Vice President of the Philippines with honor, wisdom and patriotism, 
the Filipino people who gave him a tremendous majority in the 
last election have no doubt whatsoever. 




Mrs. Luz B. Magsaysay 

First Lady of the Land 




(7TTHE new First Lady of the land is a pretty, shy young woman 
vU' of 38 who was bom Luz Banzon, in Balanga, Bataan on July 
25, 1915. She is the fourth daughter, fifth child, in a big family 
of nine born to the late Jose F. Banzon, a successful businessman of 
Balanga in his day, and Lucila Rosauro de Banzon who is now 68. 

She was married to Ramon Magsaysay when she was 18 and newly 
graduated from high school, and he was going on 26. The wedding 
took place at six o'clock of a Sunday morning, on June 10, 1933, at 
the Lourdes Church in Intramuros. From that milestone dates the 
beginning of an unusual career which saw her marvelous development 
from an unknown and simple housewife to a President's lady and 
reigning hostess of Malacanan. 

Her native good qualities and the circumstances of her birth and 
upbringing seem to indicate a background and training eminently 
suited to her position and the responsibility it carries. While the 
fierce light of publicity has been focused more on her famous husband, 
it has not failed to cast a gentle illumination on herself, to point out 
the various stages of her story as the—earnest and devoted schoolgirl, 
the modest town belle, the blushing bride, the patient and loving 
housewife, the guerrillero's calm and courageous helpmeet, the Huk 
fighter's uncomplaining refuge and, finally, the presidential candidate's 
gallant and charming asset whose grace and kindliness never faltered 
during even the most difficult days of the campaign. 

Luz Magsaysay was brought up by a strict and devout mother 
whose teachings centered on those virtues which made up for prac- 
tical, obedient and faithful wives. On the side, she was schooled at 
the Instituto de Mujeres in the various womanly arts and the social 
graces which were designed to serve her in good stead in her role as a 
young matron with civic and social responsibilities. 

The result is a photogenic facade and a calm and gentle surface, 
a dignity and sweet, well-bred manners apparent to all at sight. Her 
life as Mrs. Magsaysay, which carried her through many disconcerting, 
unexpected and extremely sudden crises, has at the same time de- 
veloped her patience — and her endurance to a point nearly of hardness. 
By nature she is generous and at the same time prudent, gentle and 
strong-willed, retiring and yet friendly. 

With her children, Luz Magsaysay behaves as a completely average 
mother. She is by turns doting and strict, approving and displeased. 



Page Twenty-three 



She has had four: Teresita, 19; Milagros, 17; Ramon, Jr., 15; and Angel, 
who died in infancy. She has not encouraged her girls too much 
in their social activities and has given Milagros all opportunities to 
improve on her hobby: cooking. But when Ramon, Jr. announced he 
wanted to be a pilot, she ran nearly in tears to her husband and 
poured out her lament. "One hero is enough for this family," she 
said. 

These are the admirable, the useful, and the altogether human 
qualities which Luz Magsaysay will bring with her to Malacanan as 
First Lady. With them she will, for the present and for the 
coming years, set new standards and new manners in that orbit of 
civic and social responsibilities over which she will preside.

Irs. Leonila D. Garcia 

The Vice President's Lady 



RS, LEONILA D. GARCIA, wife of the Vice President, is a 
native of Cebu. She is a model Filipino wife: devoted to the 
home, efficient, good-natured, soft-spoken, and well-informed. 
She is simple and unassuming and expects no recognition in any social 
or political gathering o>spite her husband's prominence in public 
life. 

Mrs, Garcia is a pharmacist by profession, having graduated from 
the College of Pharmacy, University of Santo Tomas, in 1928, She 
practiced her profession for some time in a drugstore in Tagbilaran, 
Bohol, owned by the Borromeos, which was then a fulcrum of social 
life in Tagbilaran, It was there that she met former representative 
Carlos P. Garcia and, after a conventional courtship, they were 
married- 

Mrs. Garcia's hobby, besides reading, is gardening. She loves to 
work in her garden and finds it restful and soothing to spend hours 
attending to her plants. She prefers a quiet life but because of 
the career of her husband she finds time to attend to her social and 
other obligations in keeping with her standing in the community. 
When in Manila, Mrs, Garcia looks after their home, attending 
to her husband and their only child, young and charming Linda, 
who is a Liberal Ails student in the University of the Philippines, 

Mrs, Garcia takes pride in the well-known integrity and fidelity 
to duty of her distinguished husband as a man and as a public servant 
Her philosophy is to be happy wherever fate places them. She is 
doing all she can for her family and for the people her famous 
husband has sworn to serve, trusting that God will do the rest. 
She is going to play a very prominent role in the next four years 
as the Vice President's lady. She has nothing to worry about because 
her education, disposition and experience as the wife of a national 
leader will stand her in good stead.

(The Executive Secretary of the Inaugural Committee is an ex-officio 
member of all the sub -committees)- 



Land of the morning, 
Child of the sun returning, 
With fervor burning, 

Thee do our souls adore. 

Land dear and holy, 
Cradle of noble heroes, 
Ne'er shall invaders 

Trample thy sacred shore. 

Ever within thy skies and through thy clouds 
And o'er thy hills and sea 
Do we behold the radiance, feel the throb, 
Of glorious liberty. 

Thy banner, dear to all our hearts, 

Its sun and stars alight, — 
O, never shall its shining field 

Be dimmed by tyrant's might! 

Beautiful land of love, O land of light, 
In thine embrace 'tis rapture to lie. 

But it is glory ever, when thou are wronged, 
For us, thy sons, to suffer and die. 



* Lyrics by Jose Palma (in Spanish) • Translation in English by 
M. A, L. Lane and C. Osias. Music by J. Felife.
