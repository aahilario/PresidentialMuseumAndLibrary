ME SSAGE 



It is to me a source of deep gratification that we are 
able to celebrate August 19 this year with the future capital 
city of the country, named in memory of the late President 
Manuel L. Quezon, already in the process of being created 
out of the old Quezon City which he himself founded as a 
nucleus. 

President Quezon was the Father of our Nation. It is 
proper that to his memory we build and name after him a 
modern and beautiful capital city which will not only comme- 
morate and honor his patriotism and statesmanship but also 
give this country, which he brought to the threshold of inde- 
pendence, a fitting and dignified seat for its national government 

I join the officials and citizens of the present Quezon 
City in doing honor to Manuel L. Quezon on the day of his 
nativity. I do so not only as President of the Philippines 
as a friend and follower who will forever be personally i 



debt.

The genius of our people has produced at every deci- 
sive era of our history the leader best qualif ied to interpret 
its spirit and to cope with ii$ conflicts and problems. Ma- 
nuel Luis Quezon was one of those chosen geniuses of the 
race, who emerged at exactly the right stage of our national 
development to lead our people in the peaceful campaign 
lor independence. 

His superb political talents united all classes, parlies, 
and creeds in the pursuit of the common ideal. His flaming 
nationalism inspired and sustained this union through the 
most anxious crisis of self-doubt. And fete mastery of gov- 
ernment and diplomacy led us unswerving to success. Al- 
though he did not live to see it, Manuel Luis Quezon was 
the father of this Republic and if is the patriotic duty of all 
it® citizens to enshrine him in our hearts. 

The celebration of his 70th birthday anniversary this 
year is particularly appropriate. The President and the 
Congress of the Philippines have thought it fit to establish 
the national capital of the Republic in the great city that 
he planned and raised and that note bears his honored and 
beloved name. From this year onward therefore the Re- 
public will he ahmys identified with its father and founder 
and the seat of its government will always stand under his 
inspiring memory/ all the better to realize his ideals oj 
justice and complete independence.

August 19th is a significant day in our history for it 
marks the birth of a great Filipino patriot and statesman, 
Manuel L. Quezon. No man of his time was more beloved, 
respected and honored by his countrymen. 

It is but fitting and proper that on this occasion, we 
bo iv our heads in rererentiai homage to him }eho died and 
fought for our country. His extraordinary endowment, 
sterling character and personal traits fitted him excep- 
tionally imtl for the role he was destined to assume. He 
cannot escape the accolade of fame and greatness that his- 
tory will accord him. 

In our struggle for freedom and independence, his 
ivas the voice that rallied us to the cause. During the dark- 
est hours of our national life, his unwavering courage 
nave us fresh hopes and renewed life. He was the beacon 
light in the torturous road to freedom. Today I wish to 
dratr the attention of my countrymen to the colorful and 
fxill'mnf career of Manuel L. Quezon hi the service of the 
motherland and invite them to reded i cafe themselves to the 
uohte and inspiring principles, lehich he upheld in life, 
and lastly to emulate his exampte as a servant of the peo- 
ple and ahore alt as a true Filipino.

As we commemorate the 70th birthday anniversary of 
Manuel L. Quezon, we come to remember him not only in 
his glory as President of the Commonwealth of the Philip- 
pines but in his greatness as a lawyer for having advocated 
and won the greatest of all causes; the Philippine indepen- 
dence and social justice. It is only for us the living to 
preserve such heritage and make ourselves worthy thereof.

Seventy years ago, to-day, our beloved late President 
mwm L. Quezon was born. In paying kirn tribute on hi* 
tnrthday anniversary, his shining courage, devotion, and 
sacrifices to his country's cause come to our mind. He 
died to ghrwtshj live in our memory and for posterity 
not to be erased by the element of time. Ambassador 
Carlos P. Romulo, fittingly said: "As the years recede, 
Quezon rises to his full stature and takes his place along- 
side R,ml. Bonifacio, Mab'ni and other national heroes 
Like them, he fought and died that his people might lire 
W honor and dignity among free nations of the world. 
Like them, he bequeathed a priceless heritage of courage, 
vision and devotion to duty." 

This generation and the generations to come are for- 
tunate to have as their guiding star the shinning examples 
set by our beloved late President Manuel L. Quezon's ser- 
vices to his country. In paying him tribute, let us strive 
to live and die. if necessary, for the ideal* for which he gave 
fcffe life, and in this way we can show that we are. truly 
grateful for his heroic service in the cause of his people's 
emancipation.

Quezon City has been made* by law of the land, the 
mpiUl of the Philippines since July 17, 194$ at 11:1* 
a.m. Thus is realized the historic dream and fervent tvishes 
of the great man and visionary Manuel L. Quezon. Were he 
living today, he would have been very proud that the men 
he left behind had confirmed his vision- He would have 
been very happy, 

I wan t to thank the members of Congress and I heir 
leaders; the Committee on the selection of the Capital 
Site; and the President of the Philippines, Elpidio Qut- 
rino, for having brought this to pass. 

I wish especially to thank His Excellency President 
Quirmo because it was due mostly to him that the bill 
naming Quezon City the Capital City was passed. By his 
own admission President Quirino knew the wishes and 
the dreams of the man who did so much for Ms career. 
Quezon City was primarily born because of the typical 
Quezon love for the common tao, his wish that they be 
attended to by the government, with the aim in view to dc 
the most good for the needy. 

President Quezon was the champion of social justice, 
Htx was always the avowed mission to protect the rights 
of the common man and ameliorate his social condition. 
It is a happy coneidenee for Quezon City in particular and 
the country in general, that the present President is a man 
of that same metier. It is as though two great men shook 
hands across the void, over the fulfillment of a worthy 
dream.

^Jlic J^nllclincj of Quezon City 



By PONCIANO A. BERNARDO 



From the original Rarrio Obrero Plan of President Quezon grew the vision of a great 
capital city with wide, straiqht boulevards criss-crossing the beautiful rolling country, 
with magnificent buildings and parkz — a city truly comparable >o the world's best. 



thai God 
the town. 



made the country ami 



A city represents the living essence of each eta, 
as if all the unconscious combined will of a whole 
race, all its culture, its sentiments, its aspiration. 5 
ami even its own thoughts and religions had been 
converted into a f! u y molten concent - ate and pouted 
into the city st rueturc— into its temple??, its cathc- 

chuta, its monuments, its arts and sciences, and into 

all the massive and beautiful expressions of its Cod- 
mv.de Spirit destined tO last ta\ all eternity! 

We know this to be true for we have seen an- 
eent Babylon, Tyre, Athens. Rome, and Laving- 
rend the stories of these cities, we have learned 
ancient and medieval history at the time. Tho 
glorv o! the "Golden Aee" tho story of Athens; 

the history of the Roman Fmpirc and the story of 
th> "City on the Seven Hills" were one; ancient 
history is partly ancient Babylon. 

Bccaitoe Manuel L. Quezon knew these betk • 
than most 01 US did, Quezon City was born! 

Hut let me start from the beginning, l'ow was 

Quezon City conceived"? 

The Idea oi building a new city was born <>at 

of Riesident QuezonV Serial Justice program. 

The President was looking for an ideal site fbi 

his "Barrio Ohrero". At that time, many resolu- 
tions wore brought forward but tho Rresident wa- 
llet satisfied with any of them. 

Then, one morning at a breakfast table in Ma- 
nila, shortly after, it was suggested by Don Ale- 
jandro Roees to the President. "Why not buy a 
large plot of land on the outskirts of Manila, where 
the land is cheap, and build a lot of low priced 
homes- on it?" 

'lho Diliman Estate, comprising some 1 600 hec- 
tares of a rolling hilly region back of Manila, was 

purchased by the government at five ccntavos a 
square meter. The People's Homesite Corporation, 
now a floiu '; thing enterprise, was formed on October 
is n>:>s. 

Once started, the Rresident dedicated his efforts 

Ui P ! realisalion of his pel ptojCCt, He made fre- 
quent personal Inspections with Don Alejandro Ro- 
cs nf the People's HomeSite, and directed important 
n-tivities in its development. 

It \v:i . during one of these inspections that tfcnS 
Rro.ident, quick in observation a^ usual, was im 
pressed with the beauty a-ul des'ra'nlity of the 
open country at the Outskirts of over-crowded M.\ 

nila. Right then and there, seeing a high poinj 

on tl - northeastern part of Diliman, he singled 
i' out :\ i the site of a future Philippine capitol. 

The fiist seed g:mm ; na'ed there, soon to euR 
minate in the approval of the charier of (Quezon 
City by the National A h efnbly a- Act No. on 
October 12, IjMtt. The ItfflA hectares of the I >i I * - 
r;an Ksta'e expanded to embrace the new 



Cubao. San Fiancisco del Monte, Diliman and Uni- 
versity Districts comprising an area of 7335 hec- 
tares, with over eoc-tlvrd of its area owned by 
th.e government. 

5* * $ 

S WE have seen, the Rresident brainchild 
outgrew even its original purpose. From tlv 
admirable idea of providing the working man 
with a. decent place to live in. sprang the mop- 
ambitious plan to build a '"model city" destined to 
become the future capital of the Philippines — a city 
modern in every respect, beautiful and expressive 
of the national traditions, sentiments and aspira 
tions, providing an ideal location for the nat'on il 
government as well as affording space, not only fo 
a model community for tl. 1 working classes be* 
also for people of all ranks. Thus the plan for a 
workingmait 1 * barrio grew into a city! 

The tremendous significance and fay-beaching 

importance of the creation of Quezon City is not 
only justified but merits the gratitude of the whole 
COUBtry as it fulfills one of its greatest needs — th* 
need for a model and modern capital for reasons of 
public health and sanitation, of public safety and 
CVeil f 'r reasons of beauty. Quezon City an>were:l 
every specified city need. For historical signifi- 
cance, Quezon City is even hallowed by the blood 
of '.Toes. Here, in Balintawak in 180(5 Andre. 
Bonifacio sounded the first cry for freedom. To- 
day's Quezon City residents are descended from 
those brave men who were Bonifacio's followers. 

THF PLAN OF QUEZON 
The Master City Plan of Quezon prepared by 
Mr. Harry T. Frost, consulting architect of the 
Commonwealth, is quoted hereunder: 

"QueZOIl City, unlike Washington and the mo, 
recent Canberra of Australia, is an integral part 
of a great metropolitan district. When its boun- 
daries adjoining the City of Manila were deter* 
mined, 40>0()U people already lived within its limit.-, 
in an assortment of barrios and Mi l irhs. At least 
a 1ml I dozen well defined but isolated communities 
Were expanding rapidly and in an unrelated Rap- 
hazard fashion. 

"The farsightod purchase by the ( iovein ment of 
a third of the land that was to be Quezon City, ard 
the incorporation within its boundaries of other 

large undeVelop tracts has made possible the coor- 
dination into a broad unified plan of practically tl 

only remaining residence properties near Manil i 
that are susceptible of development WO a lare-*

BUILDING OF THE NEW CITY— THIS, IF IT 
CAN BE STAGED IN CONCISE TERMS, IS PRO- 
POSED. IT WILL BE A SKETCH OF THE BASIC 
PLAN, A VIGNETTE OF THE MOTIVES BE- 
HIND IT. WITH THIS IN MIND THE ES- 
SENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN OF 
QUEZON CITY AND THE PRINCIPLES UPON 
WHICH THEY ARE FOUNDED ARE HERE- 
TOUCHED UPON. 

"Public Lands: The first objective in the plan- 
ning of Quezon City ^s to set aside public lands 
for the future needs of the Community as a whole. 
To anticipate the Land requirements of the new 
Capital for schools, parks and public buildings, not 
Jess than enough spare, or even just enough, but 
more ihan enough according to present day stan- 
dards should be reserved. 

"The second objective is to retard the exploita- 
tion of the people by those who would gain tor.t ol 
of public lands. No power to thwart unearned 
private gain from increase in land value on a large 
scale can be greater than that which rests in ths 
retention of title in government lands. And whe- 
ther or not slums thrive upon such exploitation, it 
is certain that the opportunity to prevent them i* 
greater during public ownership than under private 
control of the lands. 

"To build Quezon City as modern culture dic- 
tates, .subdivides must learn to think of land in 
terms of people. There should never be need to 
buy land from private owners in Quezon City for 
roads, schools and playgrounds. 

'Pffiman : The heart" of the Capital City is thz 
original Dili man Estate. Adjoining Diliman lies 
the new campus of the University of the Philip- 
pines. Diliman contains about Hi 00 hectares and 
the campus nearly 500; over 2000 hectares in all, 
j kilometers long and 6 kilometers wide Dili- 
man will be the seat of the government, 

k*i ™* reater r>art of diliman will be residen- 
tial [he property along the sides of the Executive 
tZl r^'^T Court HallLi should becom- the dip-

I u tJu ' effort able housing of the people in all 

nZ£\ °n Bu } the *WI for housing the 

poor will require the greatest care. 

milct T Rt : n t al Homes: Housing for workingmen 
Iftust he substantial and sanitary. The economics 
m P anning for low rental homes begin with the 

nin lin^wM 2° utiHzc the natural drainage, they 
M Skm^d bo the center to insure positive and ra- 
JSSS^ Cost-saving feature is the omission

piound that is lower than the level of the l:uildin^

drainage money and land will be conserved, 
i , 1 if l Tft *\ wi thout it the vvorkingman's viU 
kge will fall lelow accepted standards. 

Adobe stone is found in abundance in this dis- 
l net. By designing houses with party walls of thH 
material, and by taking advantage of sloping siter, 
attractive low-cost houses can be designed having 
Moor |,?vels suited to the giound, with the mini- 
mum of leveling. There is opportunity in Quezon 
f jty and especially in Diliman, for the architect 
who is in sympathy with the use of local materials 
and the economic problems inherent in building 
workiuumortV communities. 

"GroflJ) If rutsing; (Jroufj housing requires the 
minimum of str*?** area and construct inn, promote 
safely and conceives land. 



"Arterial Roads: For Diliman, for the other 
areas owned by the government and for the entiro 
city which includes large undivided estates, a net- 
work of main streets has been laid out to meet 
the bro^d needs of traffic. Regarded as an es- 
sential part of the arterial road program will be 
the planting and care o'T shade trees. 

"Local Streets: The propei tics to be subdivided 
by private owners as well as by the Govern me j I 
will be made accessible to the Arterial Roads bv 
local streets. Local streets should be treated as 
purely accessory to home building, 

"Water Courses: The natural drainage of the 
land is ideal, Rut the natural drainage must b.< 
safeguarded. 

"Parks: This means space for public recrea- 
tions. One hectare of park for each 2500 people 
has been used as a general guide or rule-of-th umb 
to determine the extent of the park system. 

u Rut large parks for the occasional use of all 
the people, will be developed on sites that have 
natural beauty. Parks in this class will include 
strips along waterways, where many scenic re- 
treats are suitable for sports and picnics. There 
will be available to the people of Quezon City h>r 
recreation within its boundaries a gross total ol 
about 1500 hectares. 

"Schools and Playgrounds: School sites are 
situated where they will best serve the purpose. It 
is regarded as the' duty of the subdivides of pri- 
vate property to donate land for these purposes, 
consistent with the areas subdivided and with thr 
number of families that it is anticipated will be 
housed thereon. One hectare is needed for schools 
and public recreations for each twenty hectares of 
land to be subdivided. 

" Zoning and Commerce: Quezon City primarily 
is a residential city. It is believed that the com- 
merce and industry of the metropolitan district, 
the work shop and the market place will remain in 
Manila. This will simplify the building of the 
Capital City. , , ri 

"Business centers have been planned, tie essen- 
tial provisions for traffic have been made, rnere 
should be no retail business on narrow streets. 

"The use of all private property in Quezon City 
will lie regulated by a municipal code, 

"Rut regulations will not make a fine city; nor 
Will a good" plan. If the spirit of the undertaking 
is grasped by the people who will have a part in its 
growth, then the new Capital under the guidance 
Of the plan will be a beautiful city. 

The above described Master City Flan of Que- 
zon Citv has provided for all natural and artificial 
features which will make the city distinctive, beau- 
tiful and outstanding. In this plan the natural 
topography of Quezon City has been taken into 
account, utilizing natural beauty to advantage. 

The following national and city buildings and 
other activities have been alloted sites in Quezon 
City: the Congress, the different departments and 
offices to be housed, also the Capital (not yet de- 
finitely decided), the Supreme Court, the Library 
nf Congress, National Archives, the Executive 
Mansion and offices, Quezon City Hall and offices, 
National and City cemeteries, Philippine Military 
Academy, University of the Philippines, all city 
hospitals, schools, markets, parks and playground, 
churches, the National Arch and the Philippine 
Exposition. Aside from public buildings and

sites, provision has been made for hotels, commer- 
cial, industrial and cultural zones, main business 
districts and other minor items. 

The main feature of Quezon City is the quad- 
rangle of Diliman, bounded by the North, East, 
South and West Boulevards, which will be the 
heart of the nation. At the left corner- of this qua- 
drangle is the Philippine Exposition site.... this 
site will contain permanent buildings of unusual 
beauty and design. 

In planning Quezon City, the fact has been 
taken into consideration that the city will be the 
cultural and artistic center rather than commer- 
cial center of the naticm. Manila will always be 
the commercial and industrial center of the nation, 
and it is expected that it will maintain that posi- 
tion by reason of location, being on the cross-roads 
of international commerce in tb_* Far East. 

However, provision has been made for the nor- 
mal business and commercial activities of Quezon 
City. 

'To the end that adequate light, pure a if and 
safety from fire and other dangers may be se- 
cured, that the taxaole value of land and buildings 
throughout the city may be conserved, that conges- 
tion in the public streets may be lessened or avoid- 
ed, and that the public health, safety, comfort, 
morals and welfare may otherwise be promoted, 
It is deemed by the City Council of Quezon City to 
»e erected; to regulate and limit the size and the 
intensity ot the use of lot areas, and to regulate 
and determine the area of open spaces, within and 
surrounding such buildings; 

To classify, peguUte and restrict the location 
°> trades and industries and the location of build- 
defiigned for specific industrial, business, re- 
sidential and other uses; 

"In establishing such regulations, it is recog- 
"•d that due allowance shall be made for cxist- 
g conditions, the conservation of property values, 
i dv / tT U < ¥ buildi »* development to the best 
of the entire city, ami the uses to which 
< h ,t> is now devoted, so as not to deprive the 
taSZLJ £$\u? lBtin * Property of its use or main^ 

tSffiX^ ****** to which " is ™* ,aw - 



To avoid the ugly criss-crossing of telephone 
and electric wires common in Manila, the Bureau 
of Public Works is now studying a plan for the 
layout of these wires and power lines underground. 

The many subdivisions in Quezon City play an 
important part in the development of this city. 
Before subdivisions are approved, a proposed lay- 
out plan is first submitted to the City Engineer, in 
collaboration with Mr. Harry T. Frost the city 
planner, these layouts are amended to conform with 
the Master City Plan of Quezon City, all subdivi- 
sion of the plan have co-relation with one another. 

These subdivision owners build their own roads 
under the control and regulation of the city en- 
gineer as regards width, grade and construction 
details. 

Further cooperation of these subdivisions with 
the city authorities consists in the donation of sites 
necessary for the city's propel* development. 

But at the forefront of tfcc gigantic enterprise 
— that of building a great city — stands the original 
idea which gave it birth, to provide the common 
"tao" with a decent place to live in, within his 
means. The basic motive was never, for a mo- 
ment, forgotten. 

CONCLUSION 

We owe much to Mr. Frost, Mr. A. D. Williams, 
former director of the Bureau of Public Works, 
Don Alejandro Boces, and to Mr. Vicente Fra- 
gante, present director of Public Works, upon 
whose shoulders the development and construction 
will rest. 

The creation of Quezon City is the realization 
of the great dream of a great man. That dream is 
taking shape, the process of erection moves apace. 

This new modern city shall be the living sym- 
bol of the birth of a nation, the Philippine Kepub 
lie that shall come into being in 194(5, All the 
combined will of the Filipino people, all its past 
and present culture, all its aspirations which shall 
soon be gloriously fulfilled shall be embodied with- 
in the carefully planned structure of this city. 

And our children shall be able to say, in the 
words of Buskin: "See what our fathers did for
