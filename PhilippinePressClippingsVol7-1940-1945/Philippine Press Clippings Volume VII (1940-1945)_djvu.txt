THE PRESIDENT REPORTS 

The message of President Quezon 
to the assembly was essentially a 
review. It reviewed not merely the 
last year, the period since the President 
had formally reported to the law- 
making bodj'', but in a general way the 
Avhole Quezon administration to date. 
As a review it quite naturally empha- 
sized the features and the theories of 
government which feature the Quezon 
platform and plan of procedure. 

In review and in recommendation 
— ^what there was of direct recom- 
mendation in the message — the Pres- 
ident emphasized the welfare of the 
people and consequently dealt exten- 
sively with economic matters — ^mattei's 
of food, health and jobs. Typical of 
this tone to the message was the recom- 
mendation that the division of fisheries 
in the department of agriculture and 
commerce be converted into a fisheries 
bureau and that a school of fisheries 
be established under that bureau. 

Throughout the message the Pres- 
ident gave special consideration to the i 
state of affairs as created by wai*, 5 
although there was relatively little of; 
specific recommendations for local 
action to meet the emergency condi-^ 
tipns growing out of the world situa- - 
tion. In fact his attitude on this point 
was one of watchful waiting, as indi- 
cated by this suggestion: “We cannot 
now foretell the situation that will 
arise in the world after the war and i 
it would be inadvisable to adopt qco-;

In the matter of national 'defense Pres- 
ident Quezon ^vas emphatic in pledging sup- 
port to the United States in defense meas-

“The Filipino people, desirous of coopemting 
with the United States in the, execution of 
this defense program, are ready to bear their, 
full share of that responsibility. To this end, 

I have assured the government of the Umted 
States, in behalf of the Commonwealth, that 
the entire Philippines — its man power and 
material resources — are at the disposal of 
the United States in the present emergency.

M^. QUEZON HAS 
QUIET BIRTHDAY, 

No Visitors Received — Mrs. 
Osmena Pays First Lady 
High Tribute ‘ 

— X- . 

Mv3. Aurora A, Quezon cele- 
brated her birthday quietly yestOi^ 
day with iier family on the yacht 
Casiana. The First Lady did not 
receive any visitors the whole day. 

President and Mrs. Quezon spent 
Sunday quietly with their tenants 
and their families lu their farm 
in Arayat, Pampanga. 

Mrs. Quezon received many mes- 
sages folicitatlnEr her on ner 
birthday. Among them was one' 
from Resident Commissioner and 
Mrs. Joaquin M* Elizalde in Wash- 
ington. 

Mrs. Esperanza Li. Osmefta, in a 
speech a radio program in honon 
of Mrs. Quezon last Sunday, praia-; 
cd the First Lady as a “steady- 
ing, wholesome influence on the 
! nation.’* 

Mrs. Oameha said t*hat there is 
ample reason for rejoicing on the 
occasion of Mrs. Quezon*® birthday | 
inasmuch as she has not only dift-^t 
charged her difficult responsibili- j 
! ties as First Lady of tjie Land | 
with tact and dignity,* but she bmi ^ 
also earned the recognition 
has come to her as social worker, 
:frlend, mother, and wife. 

Ml'S. Quezon, according to the 
Vico-PrOBldenUs wife. U the friend 
of the poor and the needy. She 
has done many things for the less 
fortunate without publicity or oa- 
tentation, and had it not been for 
the insistence of counilsBj of peo- 
ple and institutions whom she 
has aided, her benevolence would 
' not havo been publicly acclaimed 
and recognized. ; 

Mrs. Osmefta closed her speech 
as follows: "The First Lady of 

the Land belongs to the nation.* 
And our country is extremely for- 
tunate in having Dofta Aurora in 
this high and distinguished sta- 
tion. She has pioven herself, by 
her qualities of mind, of heart, 
and of character, to be smlnent- 
Iv w-’orthy of the position that she 
occupies. W> rejoice that she 
^houid be on this eminence, and 
our hearU are filied with ea

vTOKYO^ Jan. 29. — Adverse wea- 
ther today presented the survivors, 
of the sunken Philippines liner 
president Quezon to sail fi^om 
K:obe to the Philippines, according 
ta reports from the southern port. 

The American liner President 
CleveUind is scheduled to loave 
tonlorrow with the survivors bn 
board. 

All the 112 survivors are sailing aboii-d the 

on the Cle\-eland. The only ca- I Tuesday, 
sualty in the disaster was the ship’s I 
cook, Edward J. Walker. 

'AccordTiig to Captain Crlspulo 
Onrubia, the ship struck a hidden 
reef. A hole in the hull permitted 
water to fill the engine room, 
deadening the engine, A few 
hours later the veKel sunk. 

Twenty-two lifeboats were put 
off the President Quezon despite 
the rough seas. All the survivors 
were picked up by the Jananese 
vessel THdsIiima 31am and brought 
to Kobe. 

By BeutSr News Service 
KOBE, Jan. 29.— The crew of 
the Osaka Chosen Kaisha liner,. 

XJkishi MarUj which won a thrill- 
ing race against time in rescuing 
th€ passengers and crew of the 
Filipino vessel. President Quezon, 
before she sank off the southern 
coast of Japan Saturday, told 
harrowing tales of the. disaster on 
arrival of the liner here today. 

The passengers and crew of the 
Filipino ship, numbering 112 in. all, 
disembarked clad in garments pre- 
sented to them by Captain Keijiro 
Shihoj Tomisaburo Yoneda, purser, 
and other members of the Japan- 
ese vessel. Consultation with the 
• Kobe water police enabled these 
survivors to get accomodation at 
the Seamen’s Home, .Oriental Ho- 
tel, Kobe Hotel and Yamato Ho- 
tel! 

Captain Shiho said his ship ar- 
rived on the scene of -the ^saster 
7:10 o’clock Saturday morning. He 
continued: 

"At a distance of about 300 me- 
ters from the Quezon, we cast 
anchor and tried ■ in vain tr» ap- 
proach the ship amid high sei« 
and angry waves. At about- 8:00 
•o’clock we were able to rescue the 
women and children in the first 
two. lifeboats and the rest of the 
passengers and crpw later. 

"As the Quezon sank about hail 
an hour later, we were able to res- 
cue four more lifeboats. Some pas- 
sengers received scratches an 
slight wounds, while others were 
even unconscious after their a 
rowing experience, and it was an 
' extremely difficult work ge 
everybody safely aboard our ship. 

When we, took a roll call. we_found 
t-nid' men' missing and immediately 
began a search for them. 
found one of the men ^clinging on 
to a piece -of in a desperate 

i attempt toss^ve^himself and we 

^at ’odr 



search foTi: The other, EJdward J. 
Walker, was fi'ultless.** 

The tragedy occurred on sunken 
reefs, ^ur meters below che sur- 
face, and are knonm as the "‘de- 
mon reefs” because of their large 
5ize. 

Captain Shiho reccilled that a Ja- 
panese warship was also lost at 
this same spot some years ago. 
The suiwivors will be sent to Ma< 
President Cleve«

EFECTIVE REA.SSUB ANCE 

* 1 

President Quezon’s reassurance to 
business, as expressed in an informal 
talk to the American Chahiber of Com- 
merce, was thoroughly encouraging. 
But not unduly or improperly so. 

The President spoke 'with con- 
vincing earnestness in pledging busi- 
ness fair treatment and just encour- 
agement, a pledge which he made not 
merely for himself and his administra- 
tion but specifically for future Filipino 
governments. Undoubtedly what he 
had to say and his manner of saying 
it had a wholesome effect, should pro- 
duce accumulative results in the right 
direction as his promises ai-e echoed 
throughout the land and analyzed in 
their every detail and implication by 
all classes and the different classes in 
their relationships with each other.- 
No government should have to do 
a lot of explaining to any one class or 
group as against another. In fact 
there should be little or no occasion for 
considering one class or group as 
against another. Best is the govern- 
ment that has least occasion to deal 
with class differences, because a gov- 
ernment is for all classes and its work 
is most effective when the various 
economic-social classes are peacefully 
united for the common good of all. . 

President Quezon did some effec- 
tive work in his talk to the American 
business men — ^through the American 
business men to business in general 
and to everybody— -when he empha- 
sized that social justice is beneficial to 
all, that the improvement of life for 
the common man means betterment of 
conditions for all, the business man in 
particular. The special point of his 
remarks in this connection was con- . 
^cerned with ridding the public mind of | 
the impression that social justice is a 
platform for labor against capital. 

Capital and labor, and the people 
in general who are dependent on the 
united and cooperative efforts of , 
capital and labor, should be in the posi- 
tion to accept as a matter of fact that 
the government will deal fairly with 
all. Most effectively reassuring is the 
state of affairs that prompts the 
acceptance of this theory and this fact 
as matter of course, acceptance of it 
without question or quibbling.

Itataai ang saiipaii 
ng mga nagpajja- 
' takbn ng auto ] . 

Sa pag-alinsunod sa mga ta- 
gubilin ng pangulong, Manuel 
L. Quezon ay isinasaalang-alang 
na ang balak sa pagpapaival 
ng lalong mahigpit na pagsusu-- 
lit sa sino mang ibig makapag- 
palakad ng automobil upang 
mapataas ang "standard” ng 
mg^ tsuper, sang-ayon sa na- . 
pag-alaman kay Salustiai^o Re- 
yes, puno ng dibision ng auto- 
mobil ng kawanihan ng mga 
gawaing bayan kahapon. 

Natalos na bukod sa mga ka- 
alamang tekniko sa pagpapala- 
kad ng automobil ay susulitin 
din ang mga tsuper sa kaisipan 
nila, ayon sa pinapanukala. 

Ang .mga bagong tuntunin sa 
pagsusulit ay inihahanda na 
ngayon ng dibision ng automo- 
bil. Ang pagsisimula ay hindi • 
pa matiyak kung kailan, nguni’t 
pinagsusumikapan na sa lalong 
madaling panahon ay maisaga- 
wa na. 

Sa kasalukuyan ay sinusulit 
lamang ang mga tsuper o ibig 
maging tsuper sa mga kaala- 
mang tekniko nila sa pagpapa- 
lakad ng automobil. Sang-ayon 
sa pinapanukala ng kawanihan 
ng obras publikas, ang sino 
mang ibig maging tsuper ay 
kailangang kumuha nang tina- 
tawag na "written test” o pag- 
susulit na sinusulat, tungkol sa 
pangkalahatang mga kautusan 
sa trapiko. 

Sa pagbabagong pinapanukala 
ay naniniwala si Salustiano Re- 
yes na lalong mapatataas ang 
“standard” ng mga tsuper sa Pi- 
lipinas at gayon din naman ang 
pagpapahalaga nila sa panana- 
gutan. Ang karainihan sa mga 
tsuper na walang tuto sa pag- 
papatakbo, ani Reyes, ay walang 
gaanong kasanayang mental, ka- 
ya hindi gaanong inaalagata ng 
karamihan ang panagutan ni- 
la sa bayan. 

Ipinahayag ng puno ng dibi- 
sion ng automobil na ang pagsu- 
sulit sa pagpapatakbo ng auto 
ay lalong hihigpitan, bagaman 
hindi siyang lubos na makalulu- 
nas sa kawalang ingat sa pag- , 
papatakbo ng maraming tsuper. 
Pangkaraniwan na ang sino 
mang sinusulit sa pagka tsuper 
ay napakaingat sa -pa.gpapala- 
kad, sapagka’t kasama ang taga- ^ 
sulit, nguni’t kung my lisensia 
na at nagpapatakbo ng automo- 
bil sa sarili niyang pagpapasiya 
ay walang nakapipigil na sino 
man sa kanyang kalooban, ma- 
liban sa kanyang sarili. 

Napatunayan sa talang iniinga 
tan ng dibision ng automobil na 
ang karamihan sa mga t - per 
na walang ingat sa parnu-vatak-

CaDanatuan, Kueya Felji'uai-y. 12.--r-Befove ,a crowd, 25,000 

persons who paclced the stsinds to the rafters, Preside»-it Manuel 1,. 
Quezon officially opened the Bureau of Education Interscholastic Meet 
this ^afternoon in the T^ueva Ecija athletic field. 

In au extemporaneous speech 
after the contestants, coaches and 
officials of the meet had paraded 
on the field, Presideint Quezon pro- 
mised the people of Nueva Ecija 
money for the construction of a 
swimminj2f"*“pool next year, sajung* 
that he was not aware that the 
province did not have one for this 
meet. 



President Quezon arrived In 
Manila by special train from 
Cabanatiian shortly after 9 
o'clock last night. With his 
daughter, Maria Aurora, he 
later attended the reception 
given at the Nippon Club by 
tile Japanese Consul General 
to celebrate the 2,600th an- 
niversary of the Japanese Em- 
pire. 



He remarked jokiingly that the 
reason why the goveimment did not 
build a swimming pool for the pro- 
vi‘TCG is that Nueva Ecija has the 
best swimming pool in the Philip- 
pines,, the Rio Grande river. 

The President revealed that Nue- 
fa Ecija is his home province be- 
cause Baler was still part of this 
province when he was born in that 
town, as it was only years later 
that Baler became annexed to Ta- 
yabas by an act of the Philippine 
Commission. 

PresidetT.t Quezon left Manila by 
special train at 11 o’clock this 

) morning. He was accompanied by 
Secretary of Public Instruction 
Jorge C. Bocobo, Assemblyman- 
Guillermo Z. Villanueva, and ’Capt- 
ain Lambert o Javalera, his aide-de- 
camp. Arriving ki. Cabanatuan 
2 o'clock this- afternoon, the party 
was met by government officials, 
headed by Governor Aurelio Cecilio 
and Director of Education Celedo-^ 
nio Salvador. 

The party reached the athletic 

) 

field at 3 o’clock. Before the Pres- 
ident ascended the stand, girls 
placed garlands of flowers around 
his neck. 

The President, who was introduc. 
ed to the crowd by Governor Ce. 
cilio, opened his extemporaneous 
speech saying he was very happy 
to have an opportunity once more, 
to witness an interscholastic game 
of the bureau of education. He 
said he was doubly happy because 
the meet is taking place in his own 
home province. He explained he 
was born a Nueva Eeijano because 
it was many years after his birth 
that Baler was annexed to Taya, 
bas, not through military conquest,, 
but by virtue of a leg'ilative en. 
actment of the Philippine Commis. 
i sion.

Social Justice, Wellbeing Of Masses, 
National Defense Stressed By Quezon 

(Text of the speech delivcj'ed by President Quezon last January 30 .

cabinet, the Natiomt Asse^iibly, and provincial' govei'nors and treas-

yl9 






On the eve of my departure for 
the United States, I have invited 
you to this gathering to speak to 
you on certain matters which I 
consider important. In the first 
place, it seems necessary to give 
you an ■ Idea- of how the govern- 
ment will he run after my depar- 
ture, Under the former govern- 
ment, in the* absence of the gover- 
nor-general, the vice governor gen- 
eral took his -piece. This arrange- 

laeat gays risfi it® sfeaa I 



^ first left the Philippines and an- 
bounced that tire executive powers 
would stiU he ^etemed by me, that 
it was a proof of my lack of con- 
fidence in the vice-president and it 
was to be supposed that I prefer- 
red to leave the responsibility for 
the government in the hands of 
the secretary to the president 
The Commonwealth government 
is far different from the previous 
one. Them in the absence of the 
governor-general, his powers could ^ 
be exercised , by the vice-governor 
general. An act of Congress and 
another by the Philippine legisla- 
ture authorized this. The reason 
for this was that the governor- 
general and the vice governor gen- 
eral were appointive and were res- 
ponsible to the President of the 
United States, who had the power 
to define the policy that his ap- 
pointees were to follow, and hence 
it made no difference who carried 
out his policies, either Jbhe gover- 
nor-general br the vice governor 
general. 

Under the Commonwealth gov- 
ernment, the powers of the differ- j 
ent branches are clearly ' specified, 
and in general none of these or- 
gans of government could delegate 
to others powers conferred on it 
by the constitution. The assenlbly, 
for example/ can not delegate to 
the chief executive any of its leg- 
islative powers, except cases au- 
thorized by the constitution. The 
courts cannot delegate their pow- 
ers to the executive or legislative 
branches. The chief, executive can- 
not also delegate the powers 
which the constitution confers on 
no other officer of the government. 
The practice in the United States 
and other independent countries is . 
that when the chief of the state, 
for. any reason, has to leave the 
national territory, he still assumes 
the responsibility and keeps exer- 
cising the powers that correspond . 
to the executive, branch. In the 
United States exists the precedent 
of the visit of President ' Theodore 
Roosevelt to the Ca^.al Zone and 
to the republic of Panaracu Dur- 



instance that best parallels the 
present case is that when Presid- 
ent Wilson left for Europe to 
take part -in the deliberations over 
the Treate of Versailles, The 
absences ^of President Wilson 
were rather prolonged but during 
those time neither the vice pres- 
ident or anyiifnember of the cabi- 
net acted president in his 

stead. And when the session of 
Congress ended and there aro e 
the necessity of acUng ou meas- 
ures approved by that body. Pres- 
ident W^ilson found it necessary 
to rush back to America to exer- 
cise the constitutional powers 
which he could not delegate fo the 
vice president or to any member 
of the cabinet. There is still a 
more recent case, that of Presid- 
ent Franklin D. Roosevelt when 
he went to Buenos Aires. It is 
not, therefore, a lack of confld 
enco in the vice president w^hich,- 
as in the cases above cited, pre- 
vented me from delegating then 
and now the constitutional func- 
tions conferred on me as Presid 
ent of the Philippines. 

In Europe, in countries where 
a constitutional monarchy reigns, 
fhQ chief of the state is the prime 
When the prime minis- 



nt tho head of the sovornment of 
our country. i expect the vice 
prosidout to do moro than this. I 
don’t only expect him, during my 
absence, to guard over tho coope- 
ration and efUciency of tho gov- 
oi nmont of which he shall be the 
titular head, but I also expect him 
to be consulted by tho cabinet on 
Ciuestions which, during my pre- 
sence, arc usually referred to me. 
If after an open discussion be- 
tween thorn no decision is reach- 
ccl, the vice president shall sub- 
mit to )ne the result of the dis- 
cussion for my consideration and 
decision. Of course the secretary ^ 

to the President, who even in my 
presence signs many papers for 
me, will continue exorcising this 
function and orders which arc 
signed by the secretary to tho 
president by order of the presid- 
ent shall have tho same value as 
if the president himself had sign- 
ed them. 

I expect the government of the 
lilippiues to go as smoothly my 
absence as now. I want to show 
the world that wo have a govern- 
ment here that can proceed on 
its own, that is cfllcicnt in all res- 
pect and under any circumstance. 
You arc, gentlemen, the ones call 
ed upon to make the administra- 
tive machine work smoothly: I 

believe my faith in you Is 
not misplaced and during 
my absence I expect the country 
to continue enjoying the perfect 
peace and, at the least, the well- 
being that it now has. 

I will proceed to other matters 
w'hich I particularly wish to refer 

The 



minister — . 

lers of Europe leave their countiy.l to the provincial governors, 
they aro also not allowed to de 
legate to any member of their 
ce.binet the powers conferred on 
them. 



The government of the Philip- 
pines can function during my ab- 
sence and will function exactly as 
in niy presence. The department 
heads will continue to decide mat 
ters w^hicli they now ordinarily 
settle. In those in which inter 
verition of the President is neces- 
sary, my approval can be easily j 
obtained by cable. Questions ; 
which have to be submitted by the 
cabinet will be decided by that 
body under the chairmanship of 
the vice president. In case of pro- 
blems which, even in my presence. 
th«^ cabinet decides by itself, the 
usual procedure will be followed, 
QuerAions of national policy will 
be submitted to me first for con- 
sultation before decision by tho 
cabinet. 

There can be no fear that af- 
fairs will be considerably delayed 
during my absence. Fortunately, 
besides telegraphy, we have a 
more rapid means of communica- 
tion, the' wireless telephone. While 
the President is out of the couu- 

try he shall be represented by 

ing his absence the vice president . the vice-president in all acts and 
was not acti-'o president. When occasions in v/hich he should be

that country ‘.ne vice president was 



first is the national defense. The 
national defense should bo tho 
first duty of our government and 
this is said even In the Constitu- 
tion. I expect each provincial 
governor to comply woth this duty 
in respect to his province and to 
cooperate willingly in tho execu- 
tion of plans of the national gov- 
ernment in this matter. 

Gentlemen, the question of the 
Philippine national defense Is not 
a rhetorical question. It is a q'le^ 
tlon which involves the very llfo 
of the nation and the honor of out 
people. Do you want to have a 
people that does not know how to 
defend itself? Do you want us to 
be considered a people weak In 
virility and one that, instead of 
respect and consideration, deserves 
only indifference and despise. 

We should not entertain illusions, 
unfortunately, the facts show that 
no nation is respected unless it Is 
capable of fighting for its rights. 
It is true that this Is the law of 
might which should exist In the 
kingdoms of the savage; but, un- 
fortunately, this law still predo- 
minates in International relation- 
ships. It Is futile to talk here 
about immediate, absolute 
complete Independence, and. at the 
same time, truet to oor lack. ^ 
out attempting to ullUte a national 
defense system founded on 
best method.s that the modem 
science of war can offer. 

Those v/ho say that the orga^. 






















nf th& natioH£il dcfGtisG sig- 
militari^atiou of the 
«^untry, speak without any foun- 
daUon. We' are organizing solely 
a small regular army, from 10,000 

to 12,000 Inen, while we are train- 
ing a big number of Filipino citi- 
zens in the efflcient operation of 
the rifle. How qan 10,000 soldiers 1 
subdue 400,000 citizens who know 
how K> nse the rifle? Precisely, 
fl,e are not instructing our citizens 
in the use of modern arms of wai- 
as professional soldiers because 
then we will be free from the dan- 
ger of militarism, because in the 
event a military organization wants 
to impose on the government or 
on the nation, it will have to con- 
tend. with a citizenry that is pre- 
pared to fight and destroy it. This 
Is our guaranty and in one of the 
reasons for the military instruc- 
tion which we are giving* to the 
youth. 

But, in the event that we have 
to prepare the country for the na- 
tional defense, we should not for- 
get another duty that is equally 
Important, also consecrated in our 
constitution: the duty to uphold 
social justice. This will serve 
us none, gentlemen, — if it is 
not dangerous — to Instrac: 
all the Filipinos in the use of the 
arms if, at the same time, we do 
not inculcate in the heart of the Fi- 
lipino the love of the country in 
which he lives, so that he will be 
disposed to fight and die for it. 
And the love of the citizen for his 
country should not be shown only 
in the ’beauty of its panoramas 
nor in the riches of its soil. The 
love of country springs in the satis- 
faction one finds in living in it, in 
the intimate security in which one 
can live, freely and quietly under a 
just government and where the na- 
tural resources of the country are 
of the nation for the good of all 
its inhabitants. The countries that 
have unjust governments, where 
the rights of the citizens are in- 
fringed, where the national re- 
sources are concentrated in a few 
hands, do not find, in case of na- 
tional danger, the whole popula- 
tion ready to fight for the country, 
because to this population the con- 
quest of its country by another na- 
tion would mean the implantation 
' of a just and more generous gov- 
I ernment. We, for instance, have to 
1 give to' the Filipino nation a just 
government, an honest government. 

With the national defense plan 
that were are organizing, we are 
sure to repel any foreign invasion 
only if the people, who under the 
system we are adopting are the 
ones to fight, are satisfied with 
cur government. The justice and

PRESIDENT 

Grand Finale 

The tviulitional national exposition 
has been called off for 1940 to make 
TvjTv for a farmer-labor jubilee, but it 
Avill be back, bigger than ever, in 1941. 

In a lengthy meeting last wedv the 
council of state decided to make tlie 
1941 affair international in scope, ce- 
lebrating (he sixth annivci’sary of the 
Commonwealth, the 42nd of Philip- 
pine-American relations, the 400th of 
Western culture. The year 1941 will, 
of course, also mark the end of the 
Quezon administration. 

Architect Quezon 

President Manuel Quezon paid one 
more surprise visit to Manila’s new 
city hall last week and once more found 
it displeasing to his sight. The fii-st 
time he had been enraged by the lavish 
use of marble. Last week his perspec- 
tive was from a greater distance; he 
criticized the “box-like’’ structure of 
the building, on the sides facing P. 
Bureos and Arroeeros streets. lie im- 
mediately ordered that two doors be 
opened on these sides, facing the two 
streets. 

In the budget measure submitted to 
the Assembly, the President had takmi 
another architectural fling, lie had 
proposed that the government reculate 
the construction of houses along na- 
tional highways. 

The scheme was suggested by ila- 
riano Jesas Cuenco who, ns secretary 
of public works and communications, 
builds these highways. In a letter to 
Mr. Quezon, he pointed out: 

“The majority of nipn houses where 
the greater part of our population 
lives are constructed in such a hap- 
hazard and ugly fn.slpon and are so 
often crowded together that the living 
conditions of the occupants are de- 
finitely affected adversely. This is most 
noticeable in towns along our roads, 
especially in Luzon. 

“The improvement of the constric- 
tion of these houses will, it is believed, 
also improve the li\nng conditions of 
the occupants as it will give them not 
only greater pride of ownership but 
also better ventilation and sanitation. 

Aside from this, it will make our roads 
more attractive to tourists.” 

Secretary Cuenco asked access to 
f2‘),fl00 appropriated for “other ser- 
vices” of his department by Common- 
wealth Act 446, for the construction 
of 50 small-scale model nipa houses 
for exhibition in as many provincial 
capitals. All district engineers would 
also be provided with the plans for 
suf>h houses, which would cost from 
P200 to Pl.OOO each. Construction of 
hou.ses along the highways would then 
be regulated accordingly by means of 
national laws or municipal ordinances. 

Mr. Quezon approved.

Quezon Tells Leyte Folk 
He Is Not for Re-Election 



I 

er^d a speech 
tioii was said 
nas. 

Speaking in 
"^-^1 Sergio 



of w^come.' Invoca- 
by Bishop Mascari- 



Special to the TRIBUNE 
Tacloban, Leyte, May 18: — Once 
more affirming that he is not a 
candidate for re-election, President 
Quezon, speaking before a crowd 
of 10,000 persons here today, urg- 
e<l his hearers to vote for the pro- 
posed amendn^ent creating the 
senate. The President brought 
home to the gathering -the dangers 
of the unicameral system, citing 
the cases of Germany and Spain. 

Regardingr the amendm€nt on 
the presidential term, President 
Quezon asserted that he .is not in- 
terested in the matter and that 
is not a candidate for i*e-election. 
He urged the people to vote for 
the amendment creating the sen- 
ate, citing the dangers of the uni- 
camedal form of government like 
those in G-rmany and Spain. He, 
praised England and Franoe which 
have two chamber legislative bo-, 
dies. ;> 

The president pointed out the 
defects of the present unicameral 
form in the Philippines, saying 
that its actions are subject to the 
caprices of the members of the as- 
sembly. In his op:»Tion, he said, 
the Constitutional Assembly made 



its greatetik mistake by not creat- 
ing a senate. The senate will re- 
store the balance of power in the 
government, he declared. 

President Quezon told hi.s hear- 
ers that opponents to the amend- 
ments do not know what they are 
talking about. He said that the 
reason he favors the amendments 
is because he has children like 
other people, and wants them to 
live under a democratic form of 
government. Regarding the prrj» 
posed increase in salaries of the 
asseniblymen, the President said 
that the amendment would only 
re.stpre their former salaries- 'He 
justified this increase because the 
income of the government has 5n- 
creased in receht years and be- 
cause bureau directors receive big- 

as,semblymen. 



irer pay than the 

The Presidential party arrived 
hore shortly after 3 o’clock this 
afternoon, with a huge throng wel- 
coming the visitors?. The 

reviewed the army trainees at the 
wharf, after which he inaugurated 
the waterworks system. 

Governor B^fael Martinez dehv- 



Visayan^ Vice-Presi- 
Osmena, who is a 
merhoer c?t the party, praised the 
Quezon adnl'initsration for his road 
building pr^'-igi'am, bringing many 
improvements especially in Min- 
danao and Leyte. 

Introduced by the governor, Pre- 
sident Quezon began by saying 
that the inauguration of the water- 
works system means a great deal 
to the people of Leyte b^ause 
there is nothing more important 
than the .--preservation of health. 
•He said that during his four years 
of administration he has laid em- 
phasis on the improvement of san- 
itation, and for this reason he has j 
recommended to the National As- j 
sembly a large amount of money 
jto be devoted to the improvement 
of the water system in the Islands, 
i Following the speech, the Pre.s- 
Jident held a conference with pro- 
vincial and municipal officials to 
whom he explained the nature of 
the constitutional amendments. 

The party plans to visit Boron- 
gan. Besides the President and 
Mr. Osmeha, others in the party 
are Manuel Quezon, Jr., A. D. Wil- 
liams and Lt. Jose Laurel. — G.T.A,..

if — 

Wasbigton, (By Air Mail)— 
Lutin-Atuerican trade circles 
predicted here that Philippines 
President Manuel L. Quezon 
would bo successful! in winning 
Latin-American confidence and 
cooperation toward whatever 
trade projects might develop 
either immediately or after inde- 
pendence in 1946 when the Com- 
monwealth leader makes his 
projected visit to South Ameri- 
ca. 

These trade c i r c I e s were 
keenly interested in the reports 
Quezon would visit the south as 
•an indication of the increasing 
scope of “Piin A m e r i c a u / 
econom.v.” 

Trade anulysts pointed out 
that the gradual evolvement of 
the Pan-American concept would 
undoubtedly interest the Philip- 
pines since the Par Eastern 
archipelago historically has 
belonged to the western hemis- 
phere’s economic bloc. 

They recalled that in the 
earliest Spanish times, the Phi- 
lippines’ principal trade was not 
Asian or over the Asiatic route 
but transpacific through Mexico. 
They pointed out that the 
Philippines were ruled adminis' 
tratively from tbo Mexican - 
Spanish headquarters. 

The Philippines with their 
Spanish background and culture 
would fit naturally into the hem- 
ispherical orbit instead of in the 
Asiatic. They concluded that 
the Malayan racial stock has lost 
uaostof its Asiatic characteristics 
since the environment and tra- 
dition has been S|)Mnish and 
Americi^i.' like that of many 
Latin-Ainericau .states. 

In addition, the Philippines, 
with H jjopulation of 18,000,000 
persons has an economic .system 
and liviig standard more com 
parable to Latin America than 
Asia, these circles assorkd. 

They pointed out that the 
Philippines, representing a great 
consuming market for South 
America as well as the United 
States, might thus consume some 
Brazilian cotton, Argentine 
^heat, hides and canned and 
fozen meats, wool and preserved 
hods, much of which Is present- 

imported from Australia. 

M Philippines 

could supply increased amounts 
or Latin- American needs for 

’ Xca^^anir® products, 

abaca, gold and other ‘minerals

Ss the adds, ‘'un- 

less me tiiipmos themselves ’ reauest a oirmn-o kL 

element of doubt upon the whole pixJposL

. Nor IS the situation much improved bv a statp- 

mei^ such as hfts been made by William Phdin ^imme 

^ are that Congress has nothnug?-;t 

of holding tm to the Philippine after 1946 but this 

United States and the Philippine^ 
will part company as scheduled.” 

siimSi r^lected in both statements may be 

summed up as follows: the Filipinos will have their 
independence in 1946 unless otherwise thev mfske an 
demand upon Congres.s. If this' attitude is 
^ivers^ among the Amencan people or if it is p* aP 
a majority of them, they need have 
peop°e^^^ doubt as to the answer of the Filipino 

<^cept independence in 19^6 with all /l-e 



tealtstically all the difficulHea that our ronnlru vj-' 
face after indepenidence, and ire have (hndrfl }o u*^

i5ut iMB Ameanoan commenia^or^^ are careful to 
Keep d<^r for a revision of the independenf^e pro- 
gr^ slightly ajar. Although they assert most solemn- 
ly that the United States government will stick to its 
bargain and grant us our independence in 
1^6, they make the significant reservation that the 
Philippines and the United States do not have to part 
company as scheduled if the Filipinos should decide to 
ask for a reconsideration of the independence oues- 
tiom 

Assuming that th© American people and their gov- 
en^ent are still open to suggestions coming from the 
Filipino people^ even this aspect of the question is no 
longer fit subject for guesswork or conjecture. Not 
once but several times in the i«st several months, 
Resident Quezon, in his capacity as leader of the Fi- 
lipino people, has made what might be described as a 
coimter-proposal apparently inspired by the realiza- 
tion that the door to new negotiations has b^n kept 
slightly ajar by the American people. This proposal 
might be summed up as follows : 

We shall agree to a continuation of our poUtical 
relationship vMh the United States on two condi- 
tions: first, that aU essential powers be given to the 
Filipwto people and their government to direct the na- 
tional' life, excepting foreign affairs alone which the 
United States shafl continue to supervise and control; 

0 , fid second, that the one-sided economic arrangements 



oMa second, that the one-siaea economic arrangement 
h^ween the Philippines and the United States be re- 
established upon a basis of equality and justice. 

These terms President Quezon has advanced re- 
peatedly' in the past on behalf of the Filipino people. 
It is now the turn of the American people and their 
goveimment to make appropris.te answer to those 
terms. For until they do . so, it is pointless to w re- 



terms. For until they do . so, it is pointless to w re- 
minding the Filipinos constantly that they are still at 
liberty to change th^ir mind if they so choose.

UTANG SA TAGALOG 

JNALOK ug Paiigulaiig Quezon si Dr. Monroe iipang ma- 
; ging kasangguni ng Malakanyang tungkol sa mga ga- 
wain sa pagtuturo at sa mga paaralan. Kilala siya, at 
bantog sa daigdig, sa kadalubhasaan sa pagtuturo. At na- 
ririto na sa Maynila upang maihanda niya ai^g panayam 
pangdigdig na idaraos dito ng mga pedagogo. Nguni’t hi- 
git sa kadalubhasaan niyang angkin, ang tunay na naging 
sanhi ng alok sa kanya ay ang bago niyang gawi tungkol 
sa Wikang Tagalog. Salungat kay sa una niyang gawi ay 
kasang-ayon na siya ngayong ituro ang Wikang Tagalog, 
yamang.isa nang Wikang Pangbansa, at may palagav rin 
siyang ‘ang katutubong wika ay tamang gamiting w'ikang 
saligan ng mga pagtuturo sa mga imang baytang ng paara- 
lan, kung nagsasarili na. r - /■■■. 

Iyan ang ikinagiliw sa kanya ng Pangulo 

At iyan ang ibig na masamantala upang. maging katu- 
long niya, kung nagsasarili na, sa paggamit sa Wikang 
Pangbansa para sa mga paaralang unang baytang. 

Ang angking kadalubhasaan ni Dr. Monroe at ang mga 
payo niyang maihahandog sa pagpapanibagong tatag sa ■ 
mga paaralan dito ay kadalubhasaang tama ngang saman- 
talahin ng isang Ptcpublikang bago at Republikang nagpa- 
panibagong ayos at tatag. 



ong Hunio 30 ng 1939 ay naging ' 
r31, 114, 818.34, at noong Disiembre 
31 ng 1939 ay naging Pll,905, 807.93. 

Ipinatalos ng Punong Tagapag- 
paganap na kailangang magkare- 
on ng* saiaping: panglaan upang ga- 
mitin sa mga kailangan ng pama- 
halaang pilipino na nakatakdangj 
magsarill sa 1946. “Upang maisa- 
gawa ang bagay na ito ay kaila- 
ngang lumikha ng isang pondong

f MANILA, April 22-*.The fol- 
lowers and backers ^ of Vice President 
Sergio Osmeiia and Secretary of 
Finance Manuel Roxas, seemed to 
have decided to suspend their camp- 
a’gn for the nomination in the co- 
ming convention of the Naeionalista 
Party for the presidential candidates 
next year. This decision, it was 
intimated in political quarters, was 
made following an intimation in 
some quarters that President Quezon 
might consent to ruSTfor reelection, 
despite his repeated announcement 
that he is not a candidate for the 
same post which he is holding now. 

Quai*tei.*s which favor the reelec- 
tion of the President indicated that 
there are many who would like 
President Quezon reelected for the 
ecod of the country, especially 
, during this trouhlous period in the 
wcyld and the uncertainty of the 
Pacific. They opined that the 
President is not going to consent for 
reelection, the constitutional amend- 
ment for reelection is not very ne.

’ Meanwhile, the Commonwealth ! 
government favors the plan to estab- 
lish ar^ air line between Java and 
I Manila which w^’as recommended by

Liner’s Crew Lost 

SS President Quezon Dashed Against Ro .ks 
pe.,1 . South of Japan 



■ </ - v> 

Manila, Jan. 28, — United Press 
reports today stated that the 
luxury liner SS President Quezon, 
recently bought from the Presi- 
dent Steamship Lines Company 
b.v the Cojuangco and Company, 
after desperately attempting to 
fight a rough storm in the China 
Sea, was stranded early yesterday 
morning off Kamewari Island at 
the southern tip of Japan, and 
was sunk seven hours later at 
11:45 A. M. The ship was under , 
the command of Captain J G. On- 
ruhia, former skipper' of the* 
SS .Negros, replacing the Ameri 
can captain <rf the former Presi- 
dent Madison. 

The Japanese Steamer UKISH- 
IMA MARU stood by to con- 
duct the rescue operations. High 
wind and rough seas are reported- 
ly hampering the activities of the 
rescue ship. Fourteen passengers 
and 110 members of the crew 
were rescued yesterday by four 
Japanese vessels which rushed to 
the scene of the disaster. The 
chief’s cook is believed to have 
been drowned when he fell into 
the water while boarding a rescue 
life boat. All searches for the 
missing crew member proved 
futile, and the rescue ships final- 
ly departed, leaving the UKISH- 
IMA MARU. 

AmongjMfc rescued passengers 
was Joe^^ojuangco, principal 
owner of the TlT-fated liner, 
which was on her maiden cruise. 
In Manila, SOS signals were in- 
tercepted by the RCA and ^Ihe 
Globe Wireless Company. The 
Globe Wireless announced that 
the ship had been stranded at 
3:24 o’clock early on the morning 
of the 27th. and that her engine 
room had immediately been flood 
ed. The ship sank after battling 
the strong wind and lashing 



waves for seven hours 

In the meantime, Caj'tain On- 
rubia wired the owners of the 
ship in Manila that there was no 
danger of losing the ship since 
she was standing upright on a 
sandy shoal. The owners believed 
there were no passengers aboard 
the ship besides Cojuangco and a 
few of his friends. The ship is 
carrying a general cargo for 
Shanghai, Hongkong, and Manila. 

The SS President Quezon was 
the former flagship of he defunct 
Lir;, ' Pre- 

sident Madison. She has a displacer 
menfc of 8.341 tons Ine.), an 1 
would be yet the largest ship 
owned by a Philippine corpora- 
tion. It is believed that the steam - 
ship is insured at Lloyd’s for 
over a million pesos. 

Reliable sources say that the 
liner may be rescued in a few days 
time, when the storm in that 
area ceases, since, all things con- 
sidered, she has not yet been 
seriouly damaged. 

' There were 124 persons aboard 
the ship when it was stranded on 
the Japanese coast near Tanegas- 
hima, Kagoshima.

The admonition which Pre- 
sMeht Manti el • . Qaegoi^ di- 

reij-ted to labor 
Day message is by far fii® 
most sig'ti.ificant part of a do- 
clthient which may well take 
its- place among the important 
expressions of principle. 

,, ‘“ijabor has duties to itseli,” 

declares , the President, “ 

and to the goyernment. . . .” 

• L^dr owes to itself the 
duty of practicing thrift and . 
industry. To the government 
it owes the dutj^ of coopera- 
tion, and the duty to abide by 
tile laws. 

The .words could as well 
have been addressed to the en- 
tire nation— to every element 
of the population. But the 
occasion on which they^ere 
^t’oclaimed made them parties 
lilai'ly applicable to labor — in 
otlier words, to those who 
svork for a living, and who 
have had- the benefit of organ- 
isation through which they 
can secure a better living. 

• The lesson that labor in this 
i§hse cab learn from the Pre- 
l/dent's - message is that the 
pj’ganization which has given 
it its strength can be Used for 
the betteiThent of labor itself, 
§.hd ultimately for that of the 
whole nation — or it, can be 
abused, to the irreparable loss 
of labor and of the nation. 



. O’ 

The best use that can be 
made of the organization is 
the^ use of cooperation — co- 
operation with the govern- 
ment which the nation has set 
up; the use of abiding by the 
laws waich the nation has 
sanctioned for its government. 
For labor must never forget 
that this government, these 
laws, have been established by 
its consent— by the consent 
of all the people, of every ci- 
tizen, whether he carries a 
union label or whether he be- 
longa to that vast group who 
are workers even if they do 
not wear a union label — men 
and women who must work to 
live. 

Organized labor has its 
leadets and its slogans. There 
can be no quarrel with any of 
them since their purpose is 
the betterment of the living 
conditions of the working-' 
nian. But organized labor 
mu^ never forget thut it is a 
part of the people, and that in 
the last analysis its leaders, 
and its spokesmen, and its ' 
slogans are those of the whole 
people; that its government's 
concei'n is for the whole peo- 
ple ; and that that concern can 
only be fulfilled when and if 
eVeiy section of the people, no 
matter how well organized, 
woi'ks with the government of 
the whole people *for the bet- 
terment of all the people.

AT THE post-prandial caucus held in Speaker Yulo’s residence 
last week, Pi’esident Quezon dropped subtle hints that he won't 
mind running for re-election if the people should ratify the 
particular amendment clause in the June plebiscite. Legislat- 
ors at the caucus turned around and told one another : “I told

(Servicio Telcgrdfico) 

Jolo 15 de mayo. — Despues de 
una espera do vointicuatro boras 
de parte de un pueblo ansioso el 
yate *'Casiana‘\ con el Presidente 
Quezon a bordo por fin llego y a- 
traco aoui hacia las ocho y treinta ^ 
de esta nianana. 

En ausencia de un aviso oficial 
sobre la llegada, los funcionarios 
de la provincia estuvieron en con- 
tinua e.spera durante todo el dia 
de ayer con centenares sufriendo el 
calor del sol por la manana y la 
Iluvia al mediodia- 

Esta manana a las seis el *’Ca- 
siana*’ fue visto a tres niillas de la 
Bahia pero despues volvio hacia 
Taglibi causando un desengano en- : 
tre la gente que creyo que el Pre- 
sidente Quezon habia cancelado su 
venida. Pero hacia las ocho apa- 
recio otra vez el ‘’Casiana'* y pro- 
siguio su viaje hasta el puerto. Un 
grupo dc vinta.s y lanchas salieron 
al encuentro del ‘‘Casiana*^ y lo 
eseoUo hasta el muclle. 

Los funcionarios locales encabe- 
zados por el gobernador interiiio 
Calixto de Leon y a invitacion del 
Comandantc' Rafael Jalandoni de 
la comitiva presidencial. subieron 
al ‘’Casiana*’ y saludaron al Pre- 
sidente Quezon. 

Entretanto mucha gente llevan- 
do cartelones con inscripciones co- 
mo “Estamos a Kvor de las en- 
MTiiendas. Deseamos la roeleccion 
de Quezon’^ y represe»^tando a los 
diferentes distritos dc la provdneia, 
desfilq en el muelle dclante del

presion en el Presidente. 

El Jefe Ejecutivo despiie.s bafo 
e inspecciono a una compania de

en 61 muelle, el Presidente fue al

Certainly the plan of President Manuel L, Quezon 
to order the general reduction of the assessed value of 
the real property to enable the property owners to pay 
the taxes under, the pressing* economic situation, is con- 
eededly a demonstration of practical social justice. 

The current European war has produced in this, 
country a erreat economic shock. The prices of copra, ! 
hemp and other export commodities have gone down! 
below the cost of production. Temporary abandonment 
of the copra and hemp industries seems evident in the 
face of this growing economic calamity. 

Statistics show that the masses of the Filipino popu- 
lation depend on the payment of their obligations to the 
government upon the money returns their products and 
their labor command in the market. In the event, as it 
is today, that the price of labor, and the agricultural 
commodities is abnormally low, these obligations to the 
government could not be promptly and properly met. 

Under this predicament President Quezon considers 
the whole economic situation of the masses from the 
standpoint of practical social justice. Hence, the reduc- 
tion of the assessed value of the real property is logical 
and highly laudable. This plan envisages the fact that, 
the greatest principle in taxation is not how much 
amount is to be collected from the taxpayers but whe- 
ther the taxpayers can promptly and adequately come 
across the taxes due from them by the government. j

Ciudad de Quezon, mayo. — Con las 810 casas mo- 
delo para pei'sonas de modestos recursos y las 37 para los 

de sueldos elevados ya completadas en el Distrito de Dili- /lasia que las caucs, soiares ,v unti 
man, y con las obras de alganas casas mas en el barrio facUidades esten teiminadas par 
obrero, en su periodo de terminacion, se nota ahora una ^ necesjdades de ic 

nueva fase en los trabajos de construccion en esta ciudad. 

Tuntunln So Pagsisiycsscsf 

A NG mga bagong alituntunin tungkol sa taning na 

panahon sa pagsisiyasat na administratibo laban ^ 
sa xjiga pinuno at kawani ng pamahalaan na inilagda 
kaliapon ng pangulong Quezon ay mabisang panakip 
sa isang malubhang kakulangaii. Sa pamamagitan ng 
mga tuntuning ito, ngayo’y' magkakaroon na ng mga 
tiyak na pamaraaraan sa mga pagsisiyasat, na mag- 
bibigay ng katarungan sa Is-h^.t ng panig na kinauuku- 
lan, at magtatakda sa panahon ng pa^inig, pagsusuht 
ng ulat at pagpapasiya. ”•'> ^ 'I /' • 

Sa kasalukuyan, ang mga pagsisiyasat ay tila lu- 
bes na nasasalig sa kalooban ng mga tagasiyasat. Na- 
babalam kung kanilang ibig balamin, at nadadali kung 
nais nilang dalidaliin. lyan ang dahil kaya may mga 
sumbong at paratang na nabitiii nang mga buwan o 
taon, at may mga paratang at sumbong namang nilu- 
tas nang kasingbilis ng elektrisidad. Samakatuwid, 
ang katiwaliang inuusig ay malimit na nagbibigaydaan 
sa panibagong katiwalian. 

Inaasahan naming sa bisa ng mga bagong tuntu- 
ning ipinagutos ng Pangulo ayiiral ang patas n^, paki- 
kitungo at hakbang sa lahat ng pagsisiyasat na admi- 
nistratibo, sa isang paraang maigav/ad sa lalong nmaga 
ang katarungan sa nagsusumbong at sa nasusumbong, 
gayon din sa nasasangkot na kapakanap ng madia.

T he executive order issued by President Quezon lift- 
ing. the ban against salary increases for government 
employees in the same position restores one aspect of 
the salary standardization program that would other- 
wise have been discontinued. As the President explains 
in the order, the prohibition against such increase was 
previously decided upon as a precautionary measure to 
insu,re the stability of the government finances. By 
reason of the fact that I’evenue collections have exceeded 
the budget estimates, the necessity for the prohibition 

is no longer urgent and has beeu^ withdrawn. , ,■ 

Jf ’ V ^ / 

This is just ont-'more proof that the government 
schedule of salaries is responsive to the financial con-^ 
' dition of the state. That this policy is wise none will 
deny. For we cannot have a schedule so rigid that it 
cannot be altered for .sound reasons whenever condi- 
tions so require. The justice to which gnveriiment 
employees are entitled must yield, under certain cir- 
cumstances, to the superior requirements of public re- 
sources and finance. Yet whenever such resources 
warrant it, the justice which is their due ought by all 
nreans to be ^Iven not as a matter of generosity but as 
a* m3.tter cf right. •

provincias cercanas. 

Hasta ahora, la Extension de la 
calls de Espaiia es el unico caml-: 
no que se ha completado y pasa ; 
por los sitios importantes de la| 
esudad de Quezon. Ademas de^es- , 
tar unida con el distrito de i

Rssipr® the Seniftte l ■ ■ 'V ■" ^ ' 

The measure of Pi-esident Manuel L. Quezon’s concern for 
the fate of the Constitution^ aiuendment res^toTing: the senate 
can he seen in thn nddress he delivered at Iloilo the other day, 
in which he 'pointed out the weaknesses inherent in a uni- 
cameral legislative system, and warned that bicameralism is 
one of the best safeguards the liheyties, of the people can have. 

,.^Vnd hi§ is Supported not only by the historical pre- 

cedents which he cites, but by the exposition which he makes 
of the Irenaendous powers which the present single-chambered 
iegisiativo body possesses. 

The basis- of the repubVican system, which is the foundai 
tion of the Philippine government, is the principle of separa 
tion of powers between the executive, the legislative and th< 
judicial departments of government There is such a separa 
tion here today, in name. But in effect, as the Presiden 
points out, the legislative department has such vast powder 
that both the executive and the judicial departments, must o 
necessity yield to it in many instances in which for the-goo 
of the nation they should retain the maximum of independ- 
eime. 

The power of the legislative body peeds a check, just as 
th® power of every department in the government needs a 
check. The executive carwot and should not eo.ntrol the leg- 
ialative. The judicial department' is pow^erful in its sphere, 
■hut it expi-ts no cheek on the legislative, while it, in turn, is 
the creature of the legislative and as such is in an important 
Kieasure spbjeot to control. Tho oply way salutary control 
can be exercised over the legislative is from within. This is' 
impossible when there is only one legislative chamber. A 
^eond is ne,eded to preserve the sj^stem of checks and balances 
which is the only safeguard the people have against a dic- 
t^toiship. And lec it not be foi'gotten that a dictatorship by 
r group can, lie .-vust as subversive of personal freedom as 
autocratic government -by an individual and much more dif- 
^ult to coinbat once it y^-aps full power.

f^HE order of Pre sident Quezon requiring goveni- 
-S- ment offices to submit promptly to the office of 
the auditor general all papers necessary to perfect dis- 
bursements of government funds in favor of private 
[parties should result in a vast improvement of an as- 
pect of the government serv’iee that has for a long time 
been the object of repeated complaints and criticism. 
Long and often umiecessary delays in the making of 
such payments have caused private persons and cor- 
porations that do business with the government no end 
of inconvenience and even pecuniary losses. And al- 
though many such delays have been conveniently laid 
at the door of “red tape,” there has been sufficient 
justification for the belief that the service could be 
improved to the enormous profit of evervbody con- 
cerned. 

The vastness of the interests which the govern- 
ment controls and supervises purely in its capacity as 
a business organization may justify the complicated 
machinery that has been set up for the checking up of 
accoimts and the settlement of obligations. Since the 
government is trustee for the people’s money, there is 
reason for the extreme care with which it examines all 
these accounts, allowing not one centavo to be paid out 
of the treasury unless such payme?it is supported by 
the necessary papers. 

At the same time, there have been cases' of delay 
in these payments that cannot be justified on any le- 
gal or moral ground whatever, and tb?t can only he 
due to inefficiency, deliberate or mil: :nded^ on the 
part of the government officials immediately concerm 
ed in a particular transaction. Where a private per- 
son or corporation must be pi'ompt in the fulfillment 
of its business engagements for the simple reason that 
profit in the end "completely depends on rapid turnover 
and on good will earned through honesty and efficien- 
cy, the government does not feel a similar compulsion 
for the equally simple reason that it hafe little interest 
in profit as such and even less use for the good will of 
those with whom it deals. The govejyiment is sover- 
eign in every sense of the word: it neither covets nor 
owes favors from anybody, and whoever wishes to do 
business with it must do so on its terms. 

This attitude may thus be apparently justified b; 
the supreme position of the government in any tran- 
saction. As a matter of fact, however, any inefficien- 
cy on its . part ultimately results to its own disadvan- 
tage, since those parties that deal with it are to that 
extent incapacitated to perform their own obligations. 
Business goes ’round and ’round, and can only be a? 
strong as its weakest link. The government is a vital 
part of this chain of business and ..should . not be the 
weakest liiik.

‘TOUGH YEARS’ 
AHEAD-QUEZON 

Says Hard Times Are 
Why He Won’t Serve 
(Unless He Has To) 

With the nationwide campaign for 
the ratification of the constitutional 
amendments on its ^Mast lap^', Pres- 
ident Quezon, addressing the Nacio- 
nalista party chieftains at the Manila 
Jockey Club last night, hammered 
home the old arguments in favor of 
the creation of a senate, reiterated 
that he did not care to be reelected 
and was not personally interested in 
the amendment concenung the term 
of office of the President. 

About 3,000 Nacionalista leaders 
■ and lieutenants were at the rally, 
which is the first of a series of fiarty 
meetings in Manila. 

President Quezon went to the party 
rally after a five-hour conference 
with members of the Civil Liberties 
Union on the amendments in ISIala- 
cauan. The conference and discus- 
sion started at 11 a. m. and ended 
at about 4:30 p. in. 

President Quezon, tie*les.s and in 
gray sharkskin, was in a jolly mood, j 
Speaking in Tagalog he began by 
getting the crowd to laugh with him. 
But he sobered when lie pictured 
enough years'' for the nation in Uie 
I next few years to come. The world j 
I situation is so grave, he said, and the i 
future of the Philippines so uncertain j 
that he wouldn't want to be President « 
' unless he had to. «

PRESIDENT SIGNS 24 
BILLS; BACK IN CAPITAL 



President L. . Quezon 

signed the othei* Tuesday .24 bills, 
among them the immigration bill, 
which was the subject of an in- 
ternational controversy, and which 
will now be sent to President 
Roosevelt for action. The Pres- 
ident also vetoed seven bills: five 
power franchise bills, a bill pro- 
viding for the creation of the 
new municipalities of Isabela and 
Lamitan on Basiian Island, and a 
bill providing for the verification 
free of charge by peace justices 
and the registration free of charge 
by register of deeds' of instru- 
ments or mortgage, etc. 

The measures which President 
Quezon signed included, besides 
the immigration bill, the coconut 
oil excise tax budget, the bill au- 
thorizing the issuance of P20,000,- 
000 worth of social security 
bends for the purchase of big 
landed estates, the bill creating 
ihe new city of Cavite, and two 
bills intended to improve the ad- 
ministration of justice. 

With the 19 bills he had pre- 
viously approved, the President 
had up to the other Wednesday 
signed a total of 4?> measures, a 
total of C7 bills still aw’ait his 
action. , ^ 



Thh President arrived in Ma- 
nila from Baguio last Monday and 
immediately sat down to tackle 
the many official documents which 
have accumulated since he left^ 
for Mindanao a few weeks ago. 
Last Tuesday, he was scheduled to 
hear the views of sugar men on 
Bill No. 1098. proposing a tax on 
the output of sugar centrals. It 
was also hinted that he may hear 
the views of labor on Bill 1795, 
which prohibits the dismissal of 
laborers by employers unless they 
have been paid one month's wages 
in advance. 

The President was reported the 
other Wednesday as intending to 
issue immediately a relief meas- 
ure, remitting 30 per cent of the 
real property tax on all lands 
planted to coconut and other per- 
manent taxable crops, thus requir- 
ing taxpayers of these properties 
to pay only 70 per cent of the to- 
tal tax. 

The executive order would 
serve to cushion the possible ab- 
rupt effect of the repeal of the 
law which the President just 
signed, reducing the assessment 
on lands planted to coconut and 
other permanent crops by SO per 
cent.

rEiiida-ngering the Nation 

V:'- There is no activity more essential, none, in fact, so ab- 
solutely indispensable, as the production of a- nation’s food 
supply. It is the business of the government to see to it that 
this activity is never interrupted, never permitted to lag. 

In the Philippines this activity is, specifically, the ))roduc- 
tion of rice, it is a lamentable paradox that, with all the idle 
fei’tile lands available, with the millions engaged in the pro- 
duction of rice, and with the entire nation dependent on vice 
as its basic food, the country should never have been self-suf- 
ficient in this respect. 

it would be more lamentable, in /.act, disastrcai.s, if at this 
critical stage considei'ations of purely local application should 
further reduce the output. 

This is the danger a.gainst which President Manuel L. 
Quezon warned the rice planters yesterday. This is the dan- 
ger which he is determined to forestall. 

This issue between Jandowner.s and teimnts in the vice re- 
gions is important. To settle it laws hare been enacted which, 
by every criterion, would seem to be adequate to insure a .lust 
and fair arrangement between the man who owns the land and 
the men who who till it. 

But above and be,yond the landlord-tenant issue is the 
larger issue of the national need. Neither side can be per- 
mitted to jeopardize this. Both sides no^y know that the head 
of the nation will unhesitatingly use all the forces of the gov- 
ernment to see to it that it, is not jeopardized. 




i Obvious Conclusions 

Observers in Washington, commenting on the situation of 
- the Philippines as a result of Italy’s entry into the war, ave 
reported to believe that its consequence will be a greater de- 
'■ pendence by the Philip.pin,es on the United States. 

The conclusion i.s obvious. In ail situations where a pol- 
itical crisis over which the Phiiippines has no control should 
threaten the welfare and stability of the Commonwealth, the 
latter must and shall continue in its dependence on the Unit- 
ed States, until the day when the flag of an independent and 
sovereigft Philippine republic shall float over the land. The 
Philippines, for purposes of defense against aggression by a 
^ foreign power, is just as dependent on the Amei’ican federal 
: government as the Territory of Hawaii or the State of Cal- 
ornia. 

IPith regard to the other prediction, that as a result of 
the increasing gravity of the situation there will be here a 
greater and more sustained demand for the maintenance of 
President Manuel L. Quezon in office, this may be accepted as 
a sound conclusion, based on logical reasoning in the pre.sence 
of incontrovertible facts. 

At a time like thi.s, when problems and perils undreamed 
of are obtruding themselves on every waking moment in the 
lives of the people, it is comm-tn .sense to retain a leadership 
in which the public confidence has many times been vindicat- 
ed. In the United States party lines are rapidly disappearing, 
among the more responsible elements of all parties, before the 
need, generally reco.gnized. of a firm and approved leadership 
by a chieftain of proven ct?>acity. There is every reason why 
the same situation should obtain here.

Explorafiou o£. the Surigao ,Ipon Ore 
Reservation has been completed, reveal- 
ing the existence of deposits of iron 
ore of different grades amounting to 
over one billion tons, with an iron . 
content averaging about 48 per cent. 

A study of the area, the report reads, 
has disclosed “an admixture of nickel 
•vith the iron ore in a proportion which 
nay make the separation of nickel 
rom the iron commercially feasible, 

!S well a<! the possibility ' of the exis- 
tence of valuable chromite bodies.” 
Speaking of immigration, President 
Quezon stated that a stricter polici’ 
of restriction has been followed with 
a view to preventing the admission of 
aliens who are not entitled to enter 
and stay in the Philippines. Enforce- 
ment of the policy has largely con- 
tributed, he added, to the decrease of 
alien immigration into the country. As 
regards national defense, it is “pro- 
ceeding according to schedule.” Cons- 
truction and procurement programs 
have been going on progressively with 
the training program. 

“Although the period covered by this 
report is quite short,” he concluded, 
“the various departments and entities 
ot the commonwealth government 
have accomplished substantial results 
through the unstinted effort of offi- 
cios and employees of the government, 
■whose loyalty and willingness to sacri- 
fice personal convenience in the inter- 
est of the public sendee deseiwe the 
highest commendation. 

“(jood will an'd complete understand-

; McDuffie law secure in the belief and 
■anticipation that the economic uncer- 
tainties of the future will be reduced 
with the enactment of the Tydin^' 
Kocialkowski act.” /

Presi dent Quezon Visits 
Munoz School for Farmers 









tion of unsettled regions of the Philippines, President Quezon 
finds no fitter group of people than the young students ot 
the Munoz school who have just the right training and educa- 
tion to pioneer in the government's various settlement pro- 

jects. . j . 

This group of future pioneers inspired the President, on 

his second visit to the school, to pay the farmer a brief 
eulogy. He had already raised the level of farming to a 
new dignity with his rice planting ceremony and now has 
boosted the farmer up to newer heights. 



W BCEN THE PRESIDENT was ready to retire one night 
after a disastrous t 3 rphoon three years ago, he received 
word that several boys of the Central Luzon Agricultural 
School in Munoz, Nueva Ecija, were drowned. Immediately, 
he hurried to Munoz, braving the still inclement weather 
and coursing through flood-tom highways. 

Last week, he left pressing matters of state and motor- 
ed to the same school, this time to pay a routine visit. 

It is not usual for a busy executive, to honor with such 
visits an out of town school, 160 miles from Manila. But 
then, President Quezon is an unnisual president, and the 
Central Luzon Agricultural School is not just another voca- 
tional institation. It is a school for farmers, the very peo- 
ple upon whom, President Quezon believes, ‘‘the future 
security and happiness of our people depend." 

"With his current preoccupations centered on the coloniza- 



Highlights of the President’s speech in Munoz: 

“There is only one man who has no boss — the farmer." 

' “If we cannot or, at least, if we are not sure wc can 
defend the Philippines from the invasion of a first class 
military power, we can at least make certain that our land, 

^ our natural resources are left in the hands of the Filipinos.. 

“It is the aim of the government to develop our public 
domain and to place them in the hands of our people who 
'are willing to work. It is only in this way that we can 
hold our right to this wonderful land which God has given 
ns. So I say that it is the kind of education and training 
given to you here that will make certain that the Philippines , 
will be for the Filipinos.

iiczoR-Ossnesia Ticket 

With ths oHicial proclamation to-day in Manila of the oandidacios 
of President Qasaon aad Senator Osmefla for the positions of President 
and Vice-President respectively of the Commonwsalth, public attention 
is again foousaad on these two national figures. 

The ohoioe of th se two men as candidates for the two highest 
positions under the Commonwealth is indeed a happy one. The best 
years of thair lives have been spent in the peaceful but nevertheless 
srduous fight for our politioal emancipation. Now that the goal is in 
sight, it is but just that they be rewarded for their pest labors and 
demonstrated patriotism. During the past thirty years that they have 
been directing the Filipino participation in our Government, they 
showed marked ability as statesment. Their experlenoo and success 
during this period entitle them to the privilege of directing the affairs 
of the Commonwealth during., if-.-j first years, when there will be difficult 
; problems to solve. 

For every well-informed and elear-thinking Filipino, the only 
Ipatriotio course is to vote for Queson and Oosmefia and to work for 
their eandidaoUs, to at to insure their election. The Aglipayanos should 
forget that Quezon and Osmefia are Koman Catholics. The Veterans of 
; the Philippine Revolution should disregard the fact that the two coalition 
candidates are not their ohiefs. The Ilooanos should shut their eyes to 
the accidental oiroumstanae of Quezon and Osmefia being k Tagalog 
and Visayan respectively. “Antis” should forget that Osmefia is the 
head of the “Pros” and vioeverso. The only things that should ba 
borne in mind are that we are all Filipinos and that our present task 
is to pick out the two men best qualified to be the first President 
and Vite- President of the Commonwealth. 

There is no doubt that Quezon and Osmefia are the men wa 
need for this purpose. In electing them to the elevated positions for 
which they have been nominated, we shall not be trying out men of 
uaknowQ ani doubtful calibre. We shall merely be drafting for a harder 
work men who have already been tested and found to be capable. 

This is the safest and wisest thing to do under the oiroumstanoes.

In the past few days, the Misses

QUEZON HASN’T CHANGED 
MIND ABOUT REELECTION 



LUCENA — President Quezon 
said in Atimonan Sunday be was 
not running for reelection. “I will 
not run for reelection if the whole 
world asks me to/* he said in an 
after-dinner speech delivered after 
he had unveiled together with 
Mrs. Quezon the memorial tablet 
at the new national park there. 

President Quezon also said that 
the coconut oil excise tax is a 
blessing in disguise. 



_ (/ ' ^ ^ 



A statement issued Monday by 
Secretary Jorge Vargas clarified 
the Atimonan “bombshell.” Var- 
gas said that pending the amend- 
ment of the Constitution, President 
Quezon is not a candidate for re- 
election. If the presidential term 
remains at six years, President 
Quezon will not run for reelection; 
but if it is shortened to four years, 
he will run for reelection in order 
to secure a vote of confidence 
from the people on his completed 
term. Under no conditions how- 
ever will he serve even a day long- 
er than eight years, Vargas said.

UNREASONING 

NATIONALISM 

HITBroUEZON 

Blames World Ills On 
Spirit Of ‘My Country, 

Right Or Wrong' 

CAUTIONS NEP A 

Economic Nationalism 
Shouldn’t Be Abused, 
Industrialists Told 



By ClFBIAJfO Cl£> 
President Quezon condemried 
unbridled iititioiialism in a speech 
before a special program of the 
Made-in-tlie*Philippines week of tlie 
NEPA at the Bizal Memorial sta- 
dium yesterday afternoon where lie 
was guest of honor. 

He declared that the spirit of 
unreasoning and blind nationalism 
which stresses the slogan ^‘my 
country, right or wrong has been 
responsible for many world ills and 
is one of the underlying causes of 
;tlie current world chaos and anarch- 



ism. 

Brought up as a nationalist witli 
strong sentiments on things Philip- 
pine, tlie President asserted that he 
never alloived his nationalism to 
grow to the extent of placing the 
national interest over and above 
those of true justice and humanity. 

Pro'perly understood and prac- 
ticed, economic nationalism deserves 
support and encouragement, the 
President added, and said the Phil- 
ippines surely has need of it while 
it is on the threshold of aii inde- 
pendent national existence. But he 
warned against carrying it to 
unreasonable extremes. hlconomic 
nationalism which seeks protection 
for native industries can be ^^’rohg, 
he explained, and in -many instances, 
ifc has done a lot of harm. 

Must Temporarily Copy 

He expressed himself as not 
wholly in accofd with the artificial 
economy sought to be achieved 
under a program of exclusive tariff 
walls but admitted that while the 
world is practicing it, the Philip- 
pines must follow suit because it is 
tlie only way it can live and fight 
off competition of foreign goods. 

He warned Philippine industrial- 
ists, however, against indulging in 
the false hope and expectation that 
because goods are made in the Pliil- 
ippyies and with Philippine capital, 
they should be patronized by the 
people. The people of the Philip- 
pines have no such duty toward 
Philippine industries, he said. 

The safest and surest way for 
Philippine industries to survive is to 
place ^themselves on a basis of effi- 
ciency Fo thnl they can turn ont 
goods as high in quality and «as cheap 
as others fron\ aViroad, he pointed 
out.

^ Move To Revive Upper House 
Will Not Be Taken 
Up This Time 

Any step to am'end the IPhilip- 
pinc Constitution- so as to provide 
for the recreation of a bicameral 
legislature -will not taken up 
I until possibly after the presiden- 
tial elections in 1941, informed 
quai-tcrs said this morning. 

Among Nacionalista legislators 
' yere is no-v\' very littt.le interest 
in the revival of the senate, the 
, general feeling in National As- 
scinhly quarters being- that there 
is little urgency for the move. 

The senate revival move was. 
at its intense several months ago 
when it gained offleial support 
from President Manuel L. Quezon 
who expres.sed' hlras'plf as favor, 
irg a two-liouse legislature. 

Considering that the government * 
is being run on a sound basis un- 
der the unicameral system, many; 
soions feel that the senate revival 
merits less pressing attention thari 
problems involving tradje rela- 
tions between the Unitea States 
^ tbo PniUppines, the industriai- 
ization and economic develop*-, 
ment program, and the huge pub- 
lic works projects. 

Aftez* the results of the Novem- 
ber elections ai’e known, the hia- 
:joriiy party is expecOed to pre- 
pare for the 1941 presidential elec- 
tion, shoiving presidential possibiU- 
ties and taking furthjer' bteps to 
slrongthon the party. 



Reserve.^ 
Malampaya 
Fish Grounds 

A plan to prohibit fishing In 
MaJarapaya Sound in Palawan for 
a limited period to ic-stbck JLa 
depleted marine resources, v/a.s 
revealed by President Mon uol U 
Quezon at a press conference ia 
Malacanan yesterday morning. 

In his last visit to Malampaya 
Sound, the President found Its 
re.sources greatly depleted, as fish- 
erman in that locality use dyna- 
mite in Gsbing. 

The Presicicrt said that heavy 
penalties should be meted out to 
persons found using dynamite in 
fishing because they do the fisi.- 
ing industry a lot of harm. 

He revealed that" the National 
Food Products w'ill transfer its 
canning factory to Estancia, Ca- 
piz, due to the lack of an ade- 
quate fish supply in the present 
site of the fticlory in Pam)>ang\. 

Tlie President admitted that 
this government venture has not 
bten very successful, although he 
said that ail the other govezn- 
ment enterprises are showing 
well. 

He admitted that the country'' 
is facing a critical situation in 
view Of the effects of the Eu- 
ropean war. Trade with Eiirojze 
has been paralyzed, thus affect- 
ing customs collections advor.<=ely, 
and prices of main export prod- 
ucts are very low, particularly in 
the case of hemp and copra. 

The President fears that if the 
war la.sts longer, the country 
might find itself in a very tight 
situation. For this rcfison, he is 
inducing the people to plant rjore 
food crops, such as rice and corn, 
to avoid hunger. 'v

The Basic Stand \ 3 

While President Manuel L. Quezon's speech at the Univ- 
ersity of the Philippines the. other evening was the equal, in 
lucid reasoning nnd in strikingly convincing language, of any 
of his addresses, it said nothing new. Rather, it reiterated 
his fundamental position. 

It is because of this reiteration, as well as by reason of 
the clarification which he gave in the face of what appeared 
to be a wholesale misconception of his. views, that the speech 
is notable. 

Let us strip those views domi to the elementals. The Pres- 
ident believes in true democracy and in true freedom-academic 
freedom and individual freedom in the highest sense of the 
term. 



AMTI-F.D.”^ 
SOLON HITS ^ 
QUEZON ^ 



Burke Scores Reelec- 
tion, Forty Abolition 
Proposal 



What is true democta.cy'l liefinitions are many; and many 
gifted men have prepared them. But in the final analysis, is 
not true democracy a state of society’" in which the individual 
may enjoy the right to live his life as he chooses, so long as 
his choice does not impair his neighbor’s right to do the same’? 
Is it not a state of society in which the humblest has the- right 
to be heard on decisions which concern the lives of all? Is it 
not, also, a state in which every man, every youth,’ has the op- 
portunity to win to security- and happiness-^in which every 
worker is guaranteed the right to a just return for his labor? ! 

We believe, that this is the President’s definition of true ! 
democracy — a -way of life leading to every decent and honest 
man’s ideal. 

Vvhat is true freedom — academic, indiidduai, any kind of 
freedom ? 

Is it not the freedom to live and Tyork and talk and believe 
as one lists, wuthin the' broad limits set by truths and sanctions 
which two- thousand years of moral grow'th have proved to 
mankind to be eternal? 

We believe this to be the President’s definition of true 
freedom. 

His views on political parties, on all other superficial 
growths, on mechanisms through which men have sought to 
establish true freedom and true democracy, are secondarj\ 

The thing that counts in all his utterances; in all his ac- 
tions ; in all his decisions— is the fact that he sees true de- 
rnocracy and true freedom in their truest aspects, and holds 
them ever as his most cherished ideals. 

And if he advocates abolition of mechanisms and what he 
calls fetishes, as a means to the attainment of those ideals, all 
men who wmrk for the same ideals must giv^ heed to the prac- 
tical measures whidh he advocates for their achievement. 



They Can Shovf the Way 

One of the strongest implementations of his ‘'more work'’ 
program was prepared by President Manuel L. Quezon in his 
adn\inistrative order enjoining municipal treasurers to per- 
form faithfully their additional duties as agents of the Agri- 
cultural and Industrial Bank, and to refrain from exacting un- 
authorized fees for their services in this respect. 

Government employes and officials have taste and respon- 
sibilities which no one may justly minimize. But when the Chief 
Executive calls on the entire nation for greater effort, it is 
clearly up to tnose who are on the nation’s pa^o-oll to show the 
way and to set an example. 

In .the case of the municipal treasurer who acts as the gov- 
ernment . bank’s agent, this duty to set an example is made 
more obligatory *y the. position in which the additional task 
places him — ^^the position not of a government official, but of 
one w'ho has it in his power to help the growth and progress 
of his community by judicious and careful — and generous, where 
his training and common sense tell him that generosity i.s in- 
dicated — disposal of government credits. To perform this task 
is not only an obligation, but a privilege. And even if it calls 
for more work, a privilege should not be charged for, particular- 
ly .when its beneficiaries cannot pay the charge. 

But quite apart from this, the Presidents administrative 
order comes as a timely reminder to those in the government 
service that- when he called on the people to work harder, he 
meant all the people. And the men in the government service 
should be the first to answer the call. 



By JULIUS C. EDEIySTEIN 

Washington, Aug. 5 (UP): — 

Anti-administration congressional 
circles interested in Philippine 
affairs today voiced opposition to 
Commonwealth President Manuel 
L. Quezon’s renomination and 
rapped Quezon’s advocacy of 
abolition of political parties. 

Senator Edward R. Burke, Ne- 
braska Republican and widely 
recognized as a constitutional au- 
thority, opposed a second term 
for Mr. Quezon. He said the 
Philippines president should not 
consider himself eligible to suc- 
ceed himself even if the con- 
stitutional amendment were ap- 
proved by president Roosevelt. 

Burke said he favored the 
amendment to restore bicameral- 
ism in the Philippine legislature, 
hut questioned the wisdom of the 
amendment changing the presi- 
dent’s tenure from one six-year 
term to two four-year terms. He 
admitted, however, that the Phil- 
ippine proposal was superior to 
the United States’ lack of legal 
limits to the number of presiden- 
tial terms. He said '‘tradition is 
an insufficient restraint against 
ambitloh.” 

^Even if the Philippine consti- 
tution should be changed, Mr. 
Quezon should consider himself 
Ineligible for the presidency,” 
Burke said. “I have a high re- 
gard for him, but there arc some 
things more sacred that indivi- 
dual concerns.” 

Commenting on Mr. Quezon’s 
views on political parties, Bprke 
said: “If Filipinos w^ant demo- 
cracy at all, they should keep the 
two-party system. Otherwise, they 
will become imitation followers 
of Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin.” 

Rep. Fred L». Crawford, Michi- 
gan Republican, commenting on 
the same subject, said the Phil- 
ippines has benefited greatly 
;from the iwo-party a.s 

opernt‘"d in the United States. 

Rep. Karl Stefan, Nebraska 
Republican, said he hoped the 
Philippine.s would never abandon 
the two-party setup. He said the 
destruction of the two-party sys- 
tem in the Philippines would 
“give the ruling economic groups 
in the Philippines, an opportunity 
/to depress the living condition.s 
and standards of the Filipino peo- 
ple without granting this people 
an effective vehicle of oppo.si- 
tion.”

TWO sewing- groups were oi^

meeting yesterday afternoon at 
the Assumption Convent. Both 
groups will meet every two

Conchita Sunico, and the other, 
at the Assumption Convent, to 
sew childrens clothes for distri- 
bution to the poor at Yuletide. 

It was agreed that no benefits, 
should be held this year in view 
of the fact that there are so 
many benefits already*' on sched- 
ule. 

The Rev. Pather Silvestre San-

QUEZON EASES 
LID ON BIDDING 

Urgency May Now Dic- 
tate Policy On Govern- 
ment Contract Work 



It is against public policy as gen- 
eral rule to renew government con- 
tracts without public bidding, but in 
extreme cases when supplies, materials 
equipment or services are urgently 
needed, public bidding may be dis- 
pensed with after certain procedural 
requirements have been satisfied, 
according to an executve order of the 
President issued last night. 

The order likewdae made an excep- 
tion to the general rules regarding 
the acquisition of supplies, materials 
and sendees when these are available 
only from one agent, manufacturer 







THE AOAD 




D OfJA AURORA DE QUEZON — ^The whole country 
knay well wish Dona Aurora many happy returns 
of the day, for she has not only adorned the high place 
in which Providence has set her, but has scattered be- 
nedictions upon countless needy families, and has stood 
up in a manner of which any of us may be proud as ' 
the worthy representative of Filipino womanhood. 

No one who has had anything to do with any 
member of the family at Malacanan could for a mo- 
ment doubt the excellent upbringing this remarkable 
lady has succeeded in giving her family amid all the 
distractions of that high estate. And no one who has 
had an3d;hing to do with children could for a moment 
doubt that so fair a result has cost many an unquiet 
hour. As Mrs. .Qsmetia aptly quoted last night in her 
broadcast: 'Her candle goeth not out at night’. In- 
deed, no mother worthy of the name, and God be 
thanked that there are not a few among us, can call 
her time her own. 

But the higher up one is, the more the caress and 
worries multiply, so that even to attain a moderate 
success in the education of one’s children costs much 
more. To be sure, there are helps, but the day has only 
twenty-four hours. 

Even with all the blaze of publicity about the daily 
life at the Palace it is an open secret that the Mother 
of the Filipino People— as Garcia Sanchiz called Dona 
Aurora^ ‘Madre del Puehlo Filipino ’ — has given and is 
still giving unnumbered benefits by stealth. 

Yet her greatest triumph— since obedience is better 
than sacrifice— is having done what every other moth- 
er is called upon to do, and what many another is 
actually doing, and finding a well-spring of unpublished 
happiness in it: pouring herself out for her family. 
Now this is a triumph of the head as well as of the 
heart. 

As a matter of fact, if the higher studies ought 
to be thrown open to intelligent women, it is precisely 
because in the momentous task of bringing up their 
children, the more they know— but really know— the 
likelier they are to succeed. 

Hence, the sir.gular suitableness of the study of 
education for women, and the appropriateness of the 
honorary degree of Doctor of Education to be conferred 
upon Dona Aurora — who, as everybody knows, years 
ago prepared to teach— by the most venerable insti- 
tution of learning in the Archipelago, the University 
of Santo Tomas. < ’ 












or dealer and are not available any- 
Tvliere else at the prices 

offered. 

In such cases, the President said 
in his executive order, such materials 
or services may be acquired without 
the need of calling for public bid as 
it would be obvious that it would be 
nothing more than mere formality 
which might cause much loss of time. 

The order said that contracts of 
the government may be renewed ■with- 
out public bidding when the supplies, 
materials or services needed are of 
urgent nature and delay would involve 
financial or economic loss, loss of life 
or property or danger to both. 

To contractor.^ of the government, 
the new' order is believed important 
not so much for the general rules it 
would estaldlsh as the exceptions it 
r points out.

If B *00 AY, August 19. ie the 62nd 
birthday anniversary of the 
fii*st President of the Philippine 
Commonwealth. A short sketch of 
his inspiring life is therefore in 
order, 

Manuel L. Quezon Ic both a pa- 
triot and statesawui. As a patriot, 
he once that he would 

rather have a government 
run like heil by Filipinos 
than one run like heaven by 
Americana. This firm conviction 
obviously inspired him in his long 
and remarkable public career, for 
there has never been an instance 
in the long struggle of the coun- 
try for freedom in which he has 
not played^ the leading role . 

And as a statesman, his first 
signal victory was when he se. 
cured the passage by the Amer- 
ican CJongxess of the Jones Act 
which, until the establishment of 
the Commonwealth in 1935, for 
many years served as the Philip- 
pine Magna Carta. For the first 
time in their long history, the 
Filipinos under this act were em- 
powered to frame their own laws 
without American intervention, 
subject only to the veto power of 
the American governor-general 
and, finally, to that of the Pres- 
ident of the United States. 

The Filipinos were given consi- 
derable powers imder the Jones 
Act, However, when Leonard 
Wood became governor general, 
he questioned some of these pow. 
ers and a crisis arose in the gov- 
ernment. There was nothing left 
but to submit to the governor- 
general or to fight. Quezon and 

other Filipino leaders chose the 

^ latter. 

’ The next to the last step in the 

I country's fight for freedom was 
won with the passage of the 
Tydings-McDuffie Act and the 
establishment of the Common- 
wealth government. Again Pres« 
ident Quezon is to b€t credited with 
the approval of this law. To show 
their gratitude to him, the Filipi- 
nos elevated him to the highest 
post of the land, that of President 
of the Philippines. 

The last step in the country's 
freedom the President is now un- 
dertaking: the preparation of the 
country for independence in 1946. 
This^ is indeed a big task but the 
President is equal to it. 

President Quezon was bom in 
Baler, Tayabas on Aug. 19, 1878. 

He underwent every known hard- 
ships to get an education, even 
working as a muchacho in ex- 
change for free board and lodging. 
His career pales Horatio Alger's 
into insignificance. 




P ossible-Quezon 



Reiterating that a partyles.s gov- 
ernment is not iin impossibility 
here nor contrary to the funda- 
mental principles of democracy, 
President Quezon, in a speech de- 
livered at the inauguration of the 
administration building of the .FfU: 
Lj^tevn 'University last Saturday 
afternoon, reaffirmed his belief 
chat a government without political 
parties would work to the benefit, 
well-being and happiness of the 
people as efficiently as any other 
f form of government. 



The Chief Executive expressed 
the opinion that it w^ouid be im- 
practical just now to establish a 
,paiiyles.s government heje, al- 
though he considered it imperative 
that the Filipino people “should 
quickly learn to place less reliance 
on political parties for the safety 
democracy. It is more than im- 
perative, it is a matter of life and 
death for democratic governments 
to eliminate partisanship in the 
j admini.stration of public affairs." .

of the Philippines.

the lequest of a faculty mem- that political parties are essential

again spoke on his proposal for a H that Lindamentally there has V»eon

cent convocation of the University and this ?>aMy. which draws tne 

if support 'of the huijoiity,’ has' bemi

try's independence. 

Basically, he said, the minority 
parties here may be considered 
part of the majority party becaiisr 
they have the same objective, that 
oi obtaining the country’s freedom. 

"Here in th? Philippines, what 
aie our national issuesT' the Pies- 
' ident asked. "Will anyone be’ able 
! to tell me in what essential respect 
ihe parties of th^ opposition differ 
trom the avow'ed policies of the 
; Nationalist Pai ty?" 

He cited the unaninnius ap- 
pioval by delegates to the Consti- 
tutional convention of the Com- 
monwealth Constitution as the 
•jest proof that the Filipino people 
are fundamentally agreed on the 
n;rm and purpose of the govern- 
ment. 

The Piesident gave a brief his- 
lory of Philippine political partie.*?, 
concluding that “the Nationalist 
party is, for all practical purposes, 

, ne only national partj’^ that we 
have, becau.se it is the only party 
that owes its existence to the na- 
tional cause of independence, and 
because for the immense majority 
of the Filipinos it embodies our * 
bistoilcal struggle for the achieve- 
ment of that national ideal. ”

friends, 

AMiiiKICANS ANJD FOREIGX^EHS: 

frienLhil^^h?<!v^^^ expressions of good wilDand 

only teolv n -rr® showered upon me today, that I can 

onjy reply m ail humility, “I don't desen^e ttieni.” 

minri Wrthday always brings back to my 

sist^« relaf*^^ + ^ place Of my birth— my parents, brothers, 

' townsmen. I see my humble origin; we were 

< poor My father and mother were school teachers each earn- 
ing twelve pesos a. month. Outside of school hours, my father 
attended to his small farm-less than three hectares in area. In 
youth, my playmates were sons of poor families, poorer than our- 
selve^ Many of these playmates of mine are still living, in good 
health and physically strong, but they are just as poor as their 
parents were. - 



These thoughts, the memories of my youthful days, bring 
both emotions and sentiments which linger the whole year around, 
and are the moving force behind my acts as a public servant. 
They explain why at no time in my life, even after my election to 
the highest office in the land, have I ever been beyond the ap- 
proach of the h!imblest and poorest man, woman or child. They 
explain why I en^oy the company and conversation of the com- 
mon people and why, sometimes, I spend hours chatting with 
them, in their huts and barrios. They explain why my heart beats 
for the poor and my mind abhors the sight of millions of men, 
women and children bereft of the necessities of life, while others 
swim in abundance and luxury! 

It is almost inconceivable that two thousand years after the 
birth of Christ who came to this w’orld to teach the gospel of love 
among men, in countries that boast of being Christian, misery 
and want still exist in the midst of plenty! 

_ If we behaved like true Chrisians, practising Christianity in 
our dealings w;ith-our fellowmen, there would be no wars, no eco- 
nomic depressions, no revolutions, no agrarian questions, no labor 
disputes. Instead, there would be peace and contentment, and 
well-being* and happiness everywhere. 

My beloved countrymen: Whether or not you believe in Chris- 
tianity. remember that the late ol the whole human race is at 
stake in the application of social justice. Man has come of age. 
The spread of knowledge and the progress of science and invention 



have brought about the enlightenment of the people. The average 
man knows that his right to live is as sacred as that of any other, 
even if the latter were born with a silver spoon in his mouth. 

In the Philippines, the stage is set and the time opportune for 
organizing our society upon the basis of social justice. There are 
no special interests here so strong as to be more, powerful than 
the* government. There is not a single economic group that do- 
minates the other constituent elements of our community. 

It is unfortunately true that there are some captalists and 
lando\vners who would deny labor its due. But I believe they con- 
stitute a very small minority, and they can be whipped into line, if 
they cannot be convinced that, in the long run, it is to their inter- 
est to cooperate in carrying out the social justice progi^am of the 
government. In any event, vre must forge ahead with that pro- 
gram. Upon its realization depends the future of the Filipino 
people. " 

Grateful for the many blessings I have received from Divine 
.Providence, and mindful of the great honor accorded m© by our 
people when thby undeservedly exalted me to the office of trust 
and authority I now occupy, I renew my pledge, on this occasion, 
to devote my life to the cause of the poor man — that his lot may 
be improved; that his wife and children may live with dignity 
and relative comfort; that with pride and glor^r he may call the 
Philippines — this land of beauty and of rich natural resources — 
his country, not only because it is the land of his birth, but be- 
cause there is something here that he can call his own; some- 
thing of material, cultural, and spiritual value. 

Before closing, I desire to express my heartfelt thanks to all 
those who have participated in the celebration of my birthday. 
Those w*ho delivered speeches, those who sang, recited poems, 
and rendered musical numbers— to one and all I am gr.ateful. Par- 
t^ularly, I wish to express my deep appreciation of the part tak- 
en by His Excellency, the United States High Commissioner, in 
the rp.dio program this evening. His very gracious and kind words 
have touched the bottom of my heart. To those \yho have contri- 
buted to n?.ake the raising of funds for the Anti-Tuberculosis So- 
ciety a success, goes my profound gratitude. They are doing a 
noble work— that of helping to restore the health of thousands 
and thoi.'sands of people who are the victims of a dreadful di- 
sease. Once more I thank you all. Good night! 



Pres. Quezon Sign 
Two School Bills 

P9, 500, 000 (Ippropriated 
For Elementary Schools; 
Educational System To 
Be Reorganized 



In order to solve one of the 
perennial problems ■which 
every year confronts the, 
government, President Que 
zon last Wednesday night 
signed two school Bills which 
were converted into com- 
monwealth acts. The first 
Bill No. 2011 which was con- 
verted into Commonwealth 
Act No. 586 provides for a 
complete reorganization of 
the educational system of 
jthe elementary schools in 
the Philippines while the 
second Bill No. 1940 which 
was converted into Common- 
wealth Act No 587 provides 
for an a.ppropriation of P9,-_ 
500,000 for tBe maintenance 
of both the elementary and 
intermediate schools. 

‘ Basing on the recent state- 
I went of President Quezon, 
{Assemblyman Jose Urquico 
of Tarlac proposed a measure 
which would expaud the 
sphere of action of the vo 
cational schools in line with 
the President’s idea of solv- 
ing important economic prob- 
lem. The measure may be 
taken up by the August 
body sometime next January ] 
I and will be effective nexti 
school-year, 1941-1942. \

THE EMERGENCY POWERS

Discutidos 



En 3a conferencia de mesa re- 
donda celebrada la otra nocjie en- I 

gobennadores a bordo del “Don 
Esteban’^ se tratarem detallad’a- 
mente estos cuatro puntos siguieai- 
tes: 

1» Ijas obras pubJicas que en- 
vuelvan un presiipuesto no mayor 
de P20,000, correrain a cargo de Ja 
administraciooi para asegurar el 
cumplimiento de la or, den sobre 
el jornal minimo; 

2« El gobierno ceintral construi- 
ra un sistema de aguas en, las 
provincias y en los mu’nicipios, 
creando para esto un fondo revol- 
vente que se sacara d*e los PlOO, ' 
000,000 rerntegrados; 

S. Todos los fondos escolares del 
provincias y municipios se fusio-/ 
naran bajo 2a supervision del go- 
biemo centi’aJ, como medio de re- 
solver la perencie crisis escolar; y 
4o Todos los asuntos relatives 
a la hacienda en los gobiernos pro- 
vtnciales y municipales seran re- 
Bueltos finalmente por el secreta- 
rlo de hacienda, pero se deberia 
consultar al secretario del interior 
isobre el personal provincial y mu- 
nicipal. 

Se supo que el Presidente Que- ' 
ZO.U dijo a los gobemadores que ' 
ordenaria al Secretario de Obras 
Publicas y Comunicaciones, Maria- 
no^, <Juenco que anule la circular 
de la oficina de obras publicas ' 
que dispone que los proyectos que 
cuesten mas de P3,000 sean heches ; 
por medio de cemtratos. 

Se ha creido necesario dar este 
paso ixara asegurar el debido oum- 
plimiento de la orden sobre el jor> 
nal minimo. Si se^ deja solamente 
la construccion de obras publicas 
a contratistas particulares, sera 
muy probable que se desatienda a 
la orden sobre el jornal minimo, 
puea estos coutratistas solamente 
miraran por sus propios intereses. 

Si se materializa el plan del go- 
j bierno ceinti’al de establecer u'n 
; sistema de aguas en las provincias 
y en los musiicipios estos quedaran 
muy beneficiados pero abon'aran 
los gastos de construccion con los 
; derechos que se cobraran del pu- 
blico, basta que se pague loda la 
cantldad. 

El ?residantc Quezon expreso 
I tambien su conformidad al plan 
j de consolidiar todos los' fondos es- 
j eolares, para que el gohiemo cen- 
I tra/1 pueda saber las niecesidades 
i de ,los gobiernos locales. La Asam- 
I hlea Nacional votara todos los 
i fondros que hagan falta para 2a 
j apertuia dc todas las clases. 



that he may be able to cope with con- 
ditions as they arise. The national 
legislature realizing the soundness 
and logic of the President’s motive 
took him at his words . In deference 
to his wishes therefore, he got what 
he wanted. The National Assembly 
which represents the majority will 
and opinion of the people gave 
President Quezon the emergency po- 
wers — fully, freely, gladly. 

With those emergency powers he 
now enjoys, he can do anything he 
pleases tp attain his plans, purpases 
and objectives in the national in. 
terest. It is unfortunate, however, 
that under our system of democracy, 
our newspapers and other agencies 
f inimical to his administration, raise 
I a big howl to discredit this idea of 
' concentration of powers in the hands 
of the Chief Executive. In fact, the 
passage of the measure created a 
furore or rumpus thruout the islands 
lately. 

No matter how the public opinion 
views the whole situation, the fund- 
amental fact is, that the President^ 



scribe to his philosophy to exercisei 
the right, power, prerogative granted 
him by the people thru their duly 
constituted representatives for pur- 
Doses of attaining the highest possi- 
ble degree of national organization 
and discipline, to carry out the 
mighty plans and purposes of govern- 
ment. ' 

Truly, we need national discipline 
to tackle the great tasks of the na- 
tion in time like this, to insure na- 
tional solidarity. We might as wc^l 
remember that the centralization of 
such vast powers in the hands cf 
the President is only temporary, ' as 
indeed, they are designed to gen- 
erate results thru short-cut method 
rather than take to the old-fashioned 
idea of a prolonged deliberation and 
delayed action and decision on mat- 
ters requiring speed and immediate 
'Olution . 

As we look forward to the future^ 
we hope also to see the President 
use his powers within the bounds of* 
faith — faith in the general well- 
being of the nation. 



Quezon Leaves Message Enjoinmg ’ 
Support Of Woman Suffrage; Says 
Plebiscite Success To Help P.I. Cause 

j, MALACAlSlAN PALACE 

T/^ ' ^ I Manila j 

January 21, 1937 I 

To the Filipino People: ' 

On ithe eve of my departure abroad on a mission of far- 
reaching consequence to the nation, I desire' to make an earnest 
appeal in favor of woman suffrage which will be decided by 
the qualified women of the country in a plebiscite to be held on 
April 30, 1937, 

Almost every democratic country In the world today has wo- 
men suffrage; the Philippines can not afford to be an exception. 

The common people, thq farm laborers, the factory workers, 
and the small employees will be the first ones to benefitted by 
the extension of the vote to women, because the majority of these 
new electors, as it is the case with the majority of male electors, 
belong to the class above mentioned, and, therefore, their in- 
fluence in the. government will he greater and doubtless will be 
exerted In favor of measures and legislation that will promote 
their well-being. The women in the factories, in the barrios^ and 
in the far-flung communities, who are qualified to vote, should ell 
come out and vote for women suffrage on the appointed day. 



Our cause in America will receive an added Impetus when the - 
American people learn that we have granted the right of suf- 
frage to our 'Women*

^ QUEZON WORfCS HARDER 
THAN EVER ON BIRTHDAY 

4-/ '■ ■ ^ ^ 

Signs 11 Bills And Two Orders Daring Day 

Taking advantage of the brief Intermissions between social 
calls during his birthday yesterday, Presi dent Quezon repaired to 
his private office and worked harder than he had done on normal 
days. Before retiring for the night last night, he had signed 11 
bills, pardoned 169 prisoners, ai»i issued one administrative order 
and one executive order. 

' The executive order creates a 
N’atlonal Social Security Board to 
replace the National Relief Admin- 
istration, while the administrative 
order prescribes rules and regula- 
tions governing the construction of 
buildings along the new Quezon 
Avenue. 

The National Social Security 
Board would coordinate, consoli- 
date, supervise and manage all re- 
lief activities of the government 
as well as those entrusted to pri-,^ 
vate organizations using public ' 
funds. 

The following bills were signed 
yesterday, eight in the morning 
and three in the afternoon: 

— School ritual, 

lG85—Authori2ing the President 
to sell certain insular government 
properties situated in the City :of 
Manila. (Re lots occupied by the 
bureau of plant industry), 

1809— Creating the bureau of the 
census and statistics. 

2026— Creating the City of Dan- 
salan. - 

2028— Suspending the effects of 
sections. 3 and 4 of Commonwealth 
Act No. 567. (Re tax on sugar), 

2084 — President authorized, to 
grant retirement gratuity to the 
estate of Lorenzo Palileo. * * 

2055 — ^Holding of two annual spe- 
cial sweepstake races for the bene- 
fit ^ of ' the Boy Scouts and the 
Philippine Amateur Athletic Fede- 
ration. 

2063— Authorizing justices of the 
peace and registrars of deeds to 
verify and. register, respectively, 
free of charge, instruments of 
mortgage executed by a member of 
a cooperative association. 

2054— Abolishing the franking 
privilege granted the Philippine 
Army. . 

2057— Procedure in the adminis- 
trative discipline of subordinate 
ofticers and employes in the civU 
service and creation of the ci\4I 
service board of appeals. 

2059 — Amending certain sections 
of Commonwealth Act No. 396. (Re 
ievying of special assessments upon 
real estate benefited by the con- 
st tuctipn of national roads. 



President Manuel L. Quezon sign- 
ed the bill giving him vast emer- 
gency powers. In approving the bill, 
the President promised to the nation 
that he would not make* any abuse 
in the use of these powers. 

These emergency powers * are 
needed by tbe President. The people 
have opened wide their eyes upon 
learning the dumping of powers in 
the Chief Executive. 

To the man who is given the fa- 
cities to harnqss these powers, 
there is a great hope of a gi’eat ser- 
vice ^designed to lift the crumbling 
social •: order to the level of great 
prosperity. . 

President Quezon has ably demons- 
trated his efficiency and patriotism 
to his people in his long ^ public 
career. There is therefore* aii honest 
expectation that r publie program is 
to be executed along the line of 
common benefit. 

Enemies of the President have now 
a new weapon to be used for 
a new kind of attack against , the 
administration. But there is a cau- 
tion needed before kindling the fire 
of personal hatred, 
i It is wise to criticize; hut the 
'criticism should be based upon sound 
principle. Constructive criticism 
should be welcomed ; destructive cri- 
ticism should be discouraged . 

As a matter of fact, President 
Quezon is not immumed from cri- 
ticism, but be dfecourages destruc- 
tive criticism. This is the yardstick 
of the greatness of President Que- 
zon as a man and as a leader of the 
Filipino people, including those who 
antagonizes him in his program of. 
administration . ^

mundo. 

Pr esen tan dose como un ‘ nacio- 
naiista de corazon” y un fuerte 
exponente del orguJlo racial, el 



ros reciban una ,justa compensa- 
cion. 

Al decir del Presidente, el sen- 
timiento nacionalista puede prac- 
ticarse sin limitacion. en cierto 
modo, y es en 7a conservacion 
del traje native. El Presidente 
encomio el traje de la mujer fi- 
lipina que debiera ser el orgullo 
del feminismo fiilipino porque 



x'resiaente aflrmo que jamas ha tiene otro igual en el mun 

peimitido que sus sentimientos y Po^'Que en belleza y elegan- 

nacionalistas ie cegaran, al ex- supei-a mucho al traje de 



niorcto de las Islas Filijyjiias In 
patevnidad de esta organizacion, 
el Presidente expreso la opinion 
de que -el verdadero padre de la 
Nepa es el hombre quo organi- 
26 el fenocido “Bagong Katipu- 
nan". el Secret ario Manuel Ro- 
xas. Por extraho que parezea, 
dijo, la cn'tica contra el '‘Bagong 
Katipunan ' vino de los comer- 
ciantes filipiiios mas responsa- 
bles del pais que abrigaron temo- 
res por las consecuencias que 
podria acerrear la campaha del 
Sr. Roxas. El Presidente declare 
que el “Bagong Katipunan" de 
entoncGs no es mas que la Nepa 
de ahora. 

Estoy^ fuerfcemente en favor de 
la Nepa , dijo, "pero quiero que 
se me comprenda debidamente. 
Se ban apuntado muobas causas 
de la presente guerra: de esta si- 
tuacion casi anarquica en. que el 
mundo encuentra hoy dia. No 
titubeo en decir que una de las 
causas es el nacionalismo sin fre- 
no» esa adoracion fanatica del 
propio pais .de cada uno, una ve- 
neracion que no perniite impug- 
nadores o indagadores ni tampoco 
reconoce ni admile algo mejor 
que lo propio y no rinde culto 
mas que a un derecho, e\ bien da 
su propia nacion — ese nacionalis- 



tremo de colocar el interes del cualquier otro pais. Expreso sus mo Yarns' nacionalis

dia y que esta ‘‘gloria de la mu- • 

Nacionaijsta desde niiio 



jev y admiracion del hombre" 
solo se vea en los museos en 
los dias por venir. El Presiden- 
te tambien describio el “barong 

tagalog’’ como practico y como-

admifin miia .tnI ± 4 . _ •!_ f 



admitio que en el entretanto y 
hasta que el mundo se de cuenta 
de la“insensatez" de esta politi- 
oa, Filipinas tiene que adoptarla 
para su propia proteccion. 

Urgio a los industriales que 
tengan presente que es ‘‘funda- 
mentalmente erroneo" intervenir 
en las leyes naturales del comer. 
cio, como la ley del suministro y 
la demanda y la ley del costo. 
Advirtio que tarde . o temprano 
las industrias tendran que afron- 
tar una situacion &n que habran 
de sostenerse por los meritos y 
la calidad de sus articulos para 
poder sobrevivir. 

Debidamente comprendido y 
practicado, el nacionalismo' eco- 
nomico merece apoyo y aliciente, 
declare el Presidente, y agrego 
que, ciertamente, Filipinas nece- 
sita de esto en este tiempo en 
qiie se balla en los umbrales de 
2a existencia nacional indepen- 
diente. Pero advirtio que no se 
debe llevar a un extreme irra- 
zonable. El nacionalismo econo- 
inico que busca la proteccion para 
las industrias nativas puede errar 
dijo, y en muchos cases ha cau- 
sado mucho dano. 

El Presidente encomio la labor 
de la Nepa dici^ndo que es ne- 
cesaria en este tiempo en que la 
nacion esta en visperas de depen- 
der de si Tnisma, cn que el pue- 
blo debe tratar de fomentar su 
economia nacional. crear indus- 
trias que ban de proveerle de 
sus necesidades y dar no solo ali- 
ciente sino apoyo a esta tarea. 

Declare, sin embargo, que nin- 



ten obsesionados por la idea de 
imitar a otros pueblos. 

Mientras recslcaba e) valor de 
las cosas nativas, el Presidente 
critico y ridiculizo la politica de 
la Oficina de Educacidn de en- 
senar a las alumnas de las es- 
cuelas publicas la preparacion 
de pssias (cakes). *';.Por que 
ban de ensenarlas a hacer 
‘cakes’?, piegunto. ;,Por que no 
las ensenan a hacer 'bibinkas' 
‘potos’ y hasta 'suman'? Para 
una* alumna que vive en un ba- 
rrio, 4 que utilidad le podra apo^- 
tar Su conocimien to de hacer 
‘cakes’?” 

Elogio a la labor 
heclia por la Nepa 

El Presidente empezo su dis- 
curso con la observacion de que 
los filipinos tienen su modo de 
hacer las cosas como Se demos- 
tro en el mismo programa de la 
Nepa. El Presidente se refirio al 
hecho de que si bien se habia 
enumerado que el hablaria des- 
pues del numero de los bailes 
natives, el Sr. Campos, presiden- 
te de la Nepa, sin ningun aviso, 
altero el programa y le presen- 
to inmediatamente. 

Paso a, decir que la organiza- 
cion de la Nepa es meritoria por 
muchas razones. Una es que la 
Nepa ya ha existidp por varies 
anos y a juzgar por lo que esta 
haciendo “parece que esta orga- 
nizacion filipina sobrsvlvira y 
resultard mas fuerte en el trans- 



pero no chauvinista ciego 

“Soy nacionalista, he sido na- 
cionalista toda mi vida. Desde mi 
infancia, he sentido el nacionalis- 
nio en el fondo del corazon, r ne 
he sentido instintivamente org\u- 
lloso de todo lo ftlipino y no h’e 
querido aceptar la superioridad 
de cualquier oti'a cosa que no 
fuera filipina. Ningun sentimiento 
ha sido nias fuerte en mi como 
el orgullo racial, y no obstante, 
no permito. que ese orgullo nacio- 
nal se desarrolle tan fuertemente 
que llegue al extreme de cegarme, 
impuLsandome ^ sobreponer el 
interes del pais al interes de la 
justicia o al interes de la unidad 
^as grande, cual es, la huniani- 
dad”. 

Volviendo al asunto de la Nepa. 
el Presidente dijo que esta, al 
igual que el nacionalismo, puede 
ser ob.ieto de abuso o puede ser 
aplicada indebidamente. Recalco 
la necesidad de la Nepn* particu- 
larmente en este tiempo en que 
la nacion esta en visperas de de- 
pender de si misma. 

'^Pevo ninguna industiia filipina 
debe presumir”, afirmo, “que el 
publico consumidor tiene el deber 
de comprar productos filipinos, 
sencillamente porque ban sido 
producidos' cn Filipinas, por fili- 
pinos y con capital filipino. La 
unica. base en que , debe apoyarse 
el productor filipino para sobre- 
vivir es su capacidad de producir 

articulos tan buenos y baiatos, 
sino mas baiatos, que los que se 
obtienen en otras partes. Su pro- 
blema esta en producir articulos 
que puedan competir en campo 
abierto contra otros productos de 
la misma calidad y. valor. 



guna industria filipina debe pre- curso de los anos". 
sumir.que el publico consumidor ^ ^ -nt 

tiene el deber de co'mprar arti- ^ 

culos filipinos slmplemente por- aunque, segun el, el Sr. Campos

Changes to Be Asked in Slack- 
er Clauses — Creation, Ex- 
pansion of Special Services 
Contemplated in Proposal 



By ERNESTO pjEL ROSARIO 

Of the Tribune Staff 

Amendments of ifar-reaching^ im- 
portance in the 'National Defense 
Act will be sought by the Philip- 
! pine Army through Malacaan 
during the coming regular session 
of the National Assembly, it was 
learned authoritatively yesterday. 

The judge-advocate service of the 
army has prepared a bill to be 
.submitted to President, Mauuel L. 
Quezon, which contains ir.pre than 
12 proposed amendments to the 
Defense Act. This bill was the 
subject of a conference l^t Fri- 
day afternoon between Afajor Gen. 
eral Paulino Santos, chief of staff, 
and high ranking army officers. 
General Santos, who is at present 
on inspection in the south, will 
recommend the bill to Alalacahan 
for submission to ttie Assembly. 
The anuy general staff is making 
a further study of the proposed 
legislation. 

One of the most important pro- 
visions of the proposed amendato- 
ry law involves more or less a gen- 
eral shake-up of the trainee sys- 
tem*. i 

Aii important amendment to be’ 
sought is the reiduction of the 
for. faitoe to register for 
trainee service. . At present the 
penalty for this , offense is im- 
prisonment for a”' period not ex- 
ceeding one year, or a fine not 
exceeding P600, or both. The re- 
d/uction of this penalty to im- 
prisonment not exceeding a period 
of six months, or a fine not ex- 
ceeding P200, or both, is being 
sought. The. reason for this pro- 
posal, it was explained, is to cloak

Ang pagtuligsang ginagawa sa

jupang magpalaki ng mga panga-

na kapag naipagtagumpay ko ang 
[liangad kong Ito ay maililigtas 
pia walang pagsala ang niga 
jmanggagaw’a sa kasawian at pag- 
ikabigo. 

f Ang komlsiong pangbansa ng 
paggawa ay itinatag bilang pag- 
subok sa panahong nang ang 
bansa ay maliga.lig .na Inbha dahil 
sa malubh^ig krisjs sa hanapbu-

Datapwa’t sa Iwsawiang- palad, 
ang koznision na dapat sanang 
inangalaga at magmalasakit la-

nagiging mislulang ampunan la- 
mang ng mga masunui’in at ma-

t . V , Oficina necesaria 

■ c V. — 

C ORRESPONDE a la administracion del Ri’esidente 
Quezon el merito de haber realizado al fin la crea- 
cion de una oficina permanente del Censo. La nece- 
sidad de esta dependencia piiblica ya se sentia desde el 
censo anterior, el de 1918, cuando se expuso que los 
servicios de tal oficina eran necesarios. Pero no se 
llevo a cabo, tal vez por no cargar el tesoro publico 
con otro nuevo gasto.- 

No hay necesidad de ensartar razonamientos para 
demostrar que la compilacion de todos Jos dates refe- 
rentes a la nacion, su poblacion, su riqueza, su ade- 
Janto en los diversos ordenes, pues basta citar no solo 
que en todos los pueblos, en cuanto han llegado a cier- 
to grado de civilizacion y de orden, se han recogido, 
mas o menos completamente, los datos mas necesarios 
que deben formar un censo, sino tambien ’el hecho de 
que en todae nuestras oficinas pubUcas bay por lo me- 
nos un'empleado que se encarga de reunir y conservar 
todos los datos relatives a su funcion particular, y aca- 
so sea este el motivo por el cual anteriormente no se 
creyo de necesidad inmediata la creacion de una ofi- 
cina especial del censo. 

Pero, no hay duda de que esa labor desperdigada 
que hasta ahora se ha venido haciendo por cada depen- 
dencia gubernamental, sera mas provechosa para el 
publico y el gobierno mismo centralizandola o reunien- 
dola en una sola oficina especial. Hasta ahora para 
obtener reunidos .debidamente los datos estadisticos 
que reflejan el estado real de la nacion, hasta donde es 
humanamente posible, ha tenido que esperarse la pre- 
paracion del censo, cosa que, como se ha visto, no se 
lleva a cabo sino al cabo de dos decadas. 

En la creacion de la nueva oficina, tenemos dos 
vemtajas: una es la presencia en el pais del experto en 
esta labor de recopilacion de estadisticas, que fue con- 
tratado por- el Gobierno para que auxiliara en la pre- 
paraeion^el censo de este ano, y quien ha de continuar 
para auxiliar en la organizacion de la nueva oficina has- 
ta dejarla ya en marcha regular; y la otra ventaja es- 
ta en la autorizacipn contenida en la ley, segun la cual 
el Jefe Ejecutivo puede trasladar a los empleados de 
todas las demas oficinas publicas que han tenido a su 
cargo la recopilacion de las estadisticas correspon- 
dientes, y destinarlos a la nueva oficina, asi como el 
equipo, el material y los archivos, con el objeto de eco- 
nomizar, con lo cual se resuelve practieamente la ob- 
jecidn que sobre este punto pudieran oponer a la cre= 
cion' de una oficina mas.

Support To President ft ^ 



Philippine labor this morning 
hailed the birthday message of 
President Quezon to the nation 
last night as his (most valuable 
grift to his people .on the occasion 
of his 62nd birthday. 

Labor leaders, cocheros, com- 
mon wage-earners and students 
declared that the dedication of 
the President’s life to the poor is 
an indication of his deep concern 
over the welfare of his people. 

“In these times of uncertainty.’’ 
said Artemio Xabor, of the nation- 
al commission of labor “there is 
nothin^ more gratifying than the | 
Presid«i^t'« as&urance that in him i 

the working class will dnd a cham- 
pion and protector.” 

“There has never been any 
doubt in the mind of the masses 
that the President has their wel- 
fare at heart/’ Bernardo Samanie-- 
go^. of the national commission . of 
peasants, stated. 

“With his speech last night, 
thousands of people in the farms 
are convinced that in the not dis- 
tant future they will be given a 
chance to lead a free and fruitful 
life.”

Quezon 
Speech Spurs 
Planning^" 

By VICBNTE J. GUZMAN 
Of the Tribune Staff 

Members of the National As- 
sembly have been spurred into 
planning action for the improve- 



~Y\-^ . I ^ <4- ^ 




merit of civilian defense meas- 
ures following the revelation ! 
made by President Manuel L. = 
Quezon in his speech at the 
University of the ^Philippines 
last Fiiday that were war to 
come now it would find the civi- 
lian population woefully unpre- 
pared and unprotected. 

Opinion is unanimous among 
the assemblymen who have alrea- 
dy arrived in Manila for the spe- 
cial session that there is an im- 
perative need for emergency leg- 
islation to enable the government 
to make up for the delay in the 
strengthening of measures for 
the protection of the people, a 
delay which the President had 
attributed to the restraints placed 
upon the exercise of his emer- 
gency powers. 

Sdme legislative Quarters have 
even suggested the declaration 
Of a national mobilization in or- 
der to accelerate the civilian 
defense program. Sponsors of 
the plan base their suggestion 
on the President's speech in tha 
light of the growing tenseness of 
the Far Eastern situation. 

They stated that only through 
such a decia'ration could the 
country effectively and promptly 
employ the nation\s manpower 
and resources for national de- 
fense. Since the national safe- 
ty is obviously threatened, thera 
is ground for a national or even 
partial mobilization 

Under the provisions of thc^ 

National Defense Act, a national 
mobilization can only be decreed 
by the President on approval of 
the National Assembly. Th^o law 
also provides, according to a.s- 
semblymon, that whenever'' tii« 
safety of the Philippines is en- 
dangered, the President .may de- 
cree a partial mobilization. 

Howevei*, when he does .so he 
is lequired to summon the A.^;-

ther or not the partial mobilisa- 
tion so decreed shall be annulled* 

Those who suggested national 
mobilization admit that since tho 
Far Eastern situation is still in 
; a diplomatic stage, the declara- 
- tion of a national mobilization 
may have to be coordinated by 
Washington and Manila. 

Newly-elected members of Con- 
gress who are now in Manila, 
including some of the incumbent 
assemblymen, claimed that a na- 
tional mobilization was sanctioii- 
ed by the people at the last 
; elections. They said they were 
elected on the basis of the Na- 
cionalista platform which con- 
tains the following plank: “We 
favor the instant mobilization of 
all the resources of the nation 
in manpower, materials and prop- 
erties to build up as rapidly as 
possible our national defense 
and the safeguard our civilian 
population for the duration of 
the emergency.'’ 

Presumably to follow up his 
U. P. speech, the President yes- 
^ terday conferred lengthily with 
Speaker Jose Yulo and Floor 
j Leader Quintin Paredes. While 
nature of the conference was not 
officially announced, reliable 
quarters intimated that these of- 
ficials discussed the possibility' 
of the Assembly’s taking up 
some Of the emergency bills that 
the administration has drafted. 

Some Assembly members at 
first were averse to a lameduck 
! legislative body considering 5m- 

^poH^I~legisIation: It was ^ said . 

) the Maiacahan conference may 
have weighed this consideration 
in the light of the urgency of 
lepslation necessary to protec- 
tion of the civilian population. 



Students on the Land 

Receiving- only casual mention in the pness, 
Px’esident Manuel L. Quezon’s action in set- 
ting aside "a "tract of 2,000 hectares of land 
in Davao for the establishment of a planta- 
tion by a group of Ateneo de Manila students 
may one day prove one of the most significant 
moves of the time, i r( - / - 

The President’s action is, of course, In line, 
with the policy of his administration, -to fur- 
ther in every possible way the settlement and 
development of virgin lands. 

What is particularly of intei'est is the 
fact that a group of college men have display- 
ed a vision which looks beyond the narrow 
horizon of campus activity. 

It is veiy interesting, and gratifying, and 
even encouraging to hear our young men in 
the colleges and universities display gifts 
which will one day bring them into prominent 
places in the learned professions. The stu- 
dent orator may become a great lawyer, an 
outstanding political leader, and it is this an- 
ticipation of what he may one day be that 
focuses the spotlight on him when he appears 
in public competitions. 

But it so happens that the country will al- 
ways have enough lawyers and political lead- 
ers, some of the latter coming from people 
far removed from the scholastic atmosphere. 

What the country needs and has needed for 
a long time, is that the training of mind and 
character which our universities offer, their 
students be used to stimulate the productive 
erifergy of the . natron at the source of that

Buildings Near 
Creeks Banned 



New Ordinance In Quezon 



City Promulgated 



, In Quezon City it is unlawful to 
huild a lroTtKc* '6r any l<ind of build- 
ing within a radius of 20 met-rs 
from the. bank of any creek or river. 
This is provided in Ordinance Ao 
enacted by the municipal council : 
recently. fC* ^ 

This ordinance is a corollary to a 
previous ordinance which prohibits, 
using any creek or river for the dis- 1 
’posal of garbage. /V • J 

In case a building is put up I 
within a radius of 20 nieters from 
any creek or river^ the city engineer 
is authorized to demolish it. But 
that is not all. The person respon- * 
siblo for violation of the ordinance 
is liable to ini]>risonment for 30 days . 
or a fine of not more than T50 or 
botli. The same punishment holds 
* for violation of *thc ordinance prohib- 
iting the throwing of garbage in . 
creeks and rivers. •n.' 

In :Mnnila; houses have been built 
on creeks and garbage has clogged 
. tbeir beds, in some cases completely, 
’ blocking thoir channels. , This fact 
accounts in part for the poor drain- 
age in the city, it is claimed.

ASKS DEFENSE 
MONEY FOR Pi 

Boost In Defense Here 
Eeported Urged By . 

Quezon On U. S. j 

■WASHINGTON, Aug. 31 (HP).— 
Unimpeachable military quarters 
disclosed today that Philippine 
j Commonwealth President .Manuel L. 
Quezon has suggested to United 
States officials the improvement of 
the Philippines’ defenses as a pos- 
sible stabilizing influence in the 
Par East. 

It was understood Quezon asked 
that the Philippines share in the 
vast United States national defense 
expenditures through direch alloea- , 
tion of defense funds to Common- i 
wealth officials. 

Quezon ’s suggestion, made in a 
message eoursed through the 
interior department, took cogni- 
zance of the congressional antipathy 
toward increasing United States 
armed forces in the Philippines^ 
either naval or mDitary. 

Some informed quarters under- 
stood that regardless of the United . 
States’ decision on the Common- 
wealth President’s recommendation, 
additional airplanes, submarines, 
and possibly marines would be sent 
to the Philippines as part of the 
national defense' program. 

It was also believed very likely 
that President Eoosevelt would 
J order some National Guard units, 
and possibly even conscripts, to \ 
train in the Philippines to enable 1 
them to acquire general experience 
in tropical taetics. 

Quezon’s views have been made 
I known to leading war and navy 
department officials, who were 
understood to be currently formulat- 
ing recommendations for submis- 
sion to the secretaries of war and 
navy, respectively. 

According to tentative.' views 
expressed by subordinate W’ar 
department chiefs, the army is 
j inclined to oppose Quezon’s request ' 

’ on the basis of the theory that the 
Philippines is entirely indefensible 
and any funds diverted to Philip- 
pine officials to strengthen the 
Islands’ defenses would be wasted. 

Most naval officials were said, 
to feel, differently, however. It 
was understood they believed the 
Philippines may be defensible with 
1 an increase in the United States’ 

I naval strength. 

It was understood the decision on ^ 
Quezon’s suggestion may be 
reached within a month.

The Country Need 

All that has been said or written about the celebi*ation 
of the fifth annivei’sary of the establishment of the Common- 
wealth; all that has been said or written about the achieve- 
ments of the Commonwealth, has been summed up by Presi- 
dent Manuel li. Quezon in the single word, “WORK!” 

: It is work that the country needs now, the President de- 

; dares. And by this he does not mean work alone by public of- 
ficials, by the men in the government. 

; Work for work’s sake is a splendid ideal. No man may. 

remain idle and stay healthy or content. Work is that only. 

‘ heritage of all men alike, and the man who neglects this heri- 
I tage throws away most of the true incentive in life. ^ 

‘ But as President Quezon sees It, it is not work for woi'k’s 
sake alone, noble as that may be, that is needed in the Phil- 
ippines. ' , , , . J 

In the tremendous task in which the country is engaged 

today; before the grave problems, foreseen by all, but truly 
estimated by but a few, the one great necessity is regulated, 

increa.sed productivity. , , j? 

The political aspects of the Philippine problem have for 

, the time been settled. , j i i ^ 

The economic aspects remain as yet not completely solved. 

A.nd it is on the economic phase of the problem that the fu- 
, ture of the countiy, the welfare and security of the people, 

will depend. , , , ^ 

The solution of this aspect of the problem cannot be 

found in any unexpected windfall of cash. 

We cannot hope forever to be receiving coconut oil excise 
tax refunds, or sugar excise tax refunds, to keep our treas- 
' urv full and our budgets balanced. 

We cannot, in the existing unsettled world, expect any 
I sudden increase in the prices of our export commodities; 
and we cannot expect to maintain our present standard of 

living, private and governmental, on ®"^/unite^ 

income, less the contributions that come to us from the United 

^^^There is but one way by which anything like the stand^® 
we have set in government activities, in the nature and extei^t 
of the services to which we have become accustomed, can 

^That^one’way is through increased production in all fields 
‘ of efonomic endeavor. And increased production cannot be 
attained by magic, by wishing, or . by oratorj% 

The oily thing that can give us this increase is woik- 
work by and for everj^ sector of the community. 

' The humblest laborer does his share today. And there is 
enough wk for all who seek it, so that all others may do

ILOCOS NORTE 
NOMINATIONS 

Nacionalistas of Ilocos Norte 
will hold a conventioai on Septem- 
ber 16 to nominate the parly's 
official candidate for governor. 

The decision to hold a conven- 
tion was reached by the provin- 
I cial executive committee after a 
i conference with Pi*esident Ma- 
nuel L. Quezon at Malacahan 
I ^ yesterday. The Ilocos Norte 
executive committee, composed of 
Assemblymen Vicente T. Lazo 
and Ulpiano R. Ai^zadon, Gover- 
. nor Roque B. Ablan, ex-Gover- 
I nor Santiago Espiritu, €x-Rep. Iri- 
neo Ranjo, and ex-€k>veinor Do- 
mingo J. Samonte, agreed that 
the one selected at the convention 
will be proclaimed by the party's 
national executive commission as 
the official candidate. 

In view of the w ithdrawal of ex- 
Senator Santiago Ponacier from 
; the gubernatorial race, probably 
only two aspirants will fight for 
j the position. Party officials are 
reported to have asked Senator 
Ponacier to withdraw in favor of 
Governor Ablan. - 

Ablan’s nomination in the con- 
vention is anticipated. He is sup- 
ported by Assemblymen Dazo and 
Arzadon and ex-Governor Espiri- 
tu. A hitch in Ablan’.s nomina- 
tion, might develop if Dr. Domin- 
go J. Samontje, another aspirant, 
can not a prevailed upon to 
withdraw in his favor. ^

COMMUNIST CHAMPION 
OF ' COLLECTIVE SECURITY 
STOPS OVER IN MANILA EN

T"© reporters and cameramen who cover Clipper ar-

[ toilers. That message implied the best of friend- 
I ships among the three Soviet leaders, one which 
: broke up temporarily sometime before the outbreak 
^of the European war in 1939. A true friend of the 
f democracies, Ambassador Litvinoff was against So- 
viet-Nazi collaboration. Thus, a few weeks before 
the Russia-Sermany non-aggression pact, he was 
dropped from Moscow, and V. Molotoff took his 
seat. For two years since then he was not heard

that he was exiled, that he was marched

fund, cherfy-faced visitor from Russia.* Maxim Maxi- kicking. For it was their last breathing spell be- 



movich Litvinoff, ex-People s Commissar for Foreign 
Affairs of the USSR. It was he and his wife who fur- 
nished the newspapermen rare headline material and 
the cameramen full-page or cover stuff. 

The Russian guests were welcomed by official 
representatives of the American High Comntis- 
sioner’s Office, the Commonwealth government, the 
British and Chinese consulates. They were tendered 
official functions by both the President of the Philip- 
pine Commonwealth and the American High Com- 
nrtissioner, and luncheon by the British Consul Gen- 
eral — an .honor Ambassador Litvinoff’s country and 
position deserve and which he himself has indirectly 
earned, Fcr under his direction, the Soviet govern- 
ment was recognized by the United States in 1-933, 
admitted to the League of Nations in 1934, and 
signed up non-aggression pacts with every one of its 
European and Asiatic neighbors including Japan. The 
British government was not ready to recognize him 
in 1917, but British society did; he married Ivy Low, 
daughter of Sir Sydney Low of London. 

Born 65 years ago, son of a petty bank em- 
ployee, Ambassador Litvinoff first showed his so- 
cialistic leanings while serving Vis compulsory term 
in the imperial Russian army. He took an active part 
iii organizing secret circles, publishing bolshevik 
doctrines in his early twenties and was jailed in 1901 
as a consequence. One year later he broke jail and 
fled to Switeerland, then to London, and finally made 
his way to revolutionary centers in St. Petersburg, 
the Urals and the Volga district. From here he fled 
to France in 1908. Preaching his doctrines actively 
among the French led to his deportation. He fled to 
London, remained there 10 years doing odd jobs but 
always keeping the bolshevik influence active. The 
revolution of October 25, 1917, rewarded him fully 
for his labors — ^for that week he was appointed *’first 
soviet ambassador to Great Britain." 

Thus began for him a decade of diplomatic 
activities. Possessed with gifts not exactly fitted to 
his new career, he made a name for his dramatic 
acts at conference tables. While his fellow-delegates 
to the Geneva conference in 1927 always sought a 
thousand words to express one single idea, the So- 
viet diplomat picked ihe tersest terms and put in a 
pungent word or two to boot. Gradually he mel- 
lowed, and under his influence, the soviet foreign 
policy gained prestige everywhere. His people re- 
cognize his successes and had fittingly awarded him 
five years ago, the Order of Lenin, considered the 
highest award of the Moscow government.

SOTTO WANTS 
CHANGES OF 



Mercado Cannot Sign Ap- 
I pointment Of Inspectors 
Proposed By V . Sotto 

# 

The proposal' by Attorney Vicen- 
te Sotto, supreme head of the Po- 
pular Front, to change all the op- 
position inspectors in the City with 
new appointees in accordance with 
the list of proposed inspectors pre- 
pared by Eduardo de Roda, could 
not be acted On yesterday, because 
Hegino Mercado, president of the 
Municipal Board, is no longer au- 
thorized to sign apointments of 
inspectors in accordance with sec- 
tion 23 of the electoral code. 

Pre-ident Manuel L,. .Quezon has 
appointed eig!.t members of an 
special board to dispose of all elec- 
tion matters in connection with the 
doming December elections . 

Attorney Vicente Sotto went to 
the fiscal's office yesterday to ask 
opinion whether the special boai-d 
could act on the appointment of 
the 170 electioi! inspectors who will 
sit in the session of t":G election 
inspectors tomoiTow to replace 
those appointed by President Regino 
Mercado . 

The members of . the special 
board President Quezon appointed 
are Vicente Urgello, Pedro Calde- 
i*on, Ciriaco Salazar, Catalina S. 
Ybahez, Ramon Blanco, Andres 
Momongan, M. Cui, Attorney Vaz- 
quez. Some of them were sworn 
to office yesterday . 

When Vicente Sotto submitted 
to the provincial fiscal the list of 
the names of the 170 inspectors, 
complications came up because 
K>me of ?.:ose appointed by Pres- 
ident Quezon did not take their 
l^th of office. Vicente Urgello 
inquired from the fiscal's office 
whether he could be a member of 
the special board since he is a mem- 
ber of the city board of tax ap- 
peals. Mrs. Catalina Ybahez was 
reported to be running fcr the post 
of the provincial governor under, 
the Popular Front ticket . 

The provincial fiscal asked opi. 
nion from the commission on elec- 
tion whether the member appointed 
by President Quezon is the pres- 
ident of the special board and if 
BO, whether he could sign the ax>- 
pointments of the election inspec- 
tors.

magiging halaga pg kalayaan ng

[i at alipin ng mga dayuhan Hindi 
baga iyan ay isang maitim na 
batik Tig pagkabusabos na dapat 
Ikahiya ng bayang ito?, KUng 
gayon, ang pagkakaroon ng sari- 
ling Wikang Pangbansa na kasa- 
lukuyan nang ipinatutnro sa mga 
paaralang bayan, ay kattimbas ng '

ikalawaj Ang Tanggulang 
Bansa. ^ 

Aasg pagiiahanda hg Tanggu- 
Jeu3g. Bansa na siyang kannawna- 



hang batas ng Malasariling Pa- 
mahalaan na nilagdaan ng pa- 
ngulong Quezon noong ika 21 ng 
Dlsfembro, 1935, ay isa sa lalong 
mahahalagang nagawa ng “Com- 
monwealth”, Ito ang niaitutu*- 
ring na batong pamantungan ng 
kapayapaan at katatagan ng 
bansang ito, at Iyan ang magi- 
ging moog na tanggulan sa pa- 
nahon ng lagim at pananalakay 
ng ibang mga bansa. Ito ang 
magiging bisig na niagtatangka- 
kal sa karangalan ng bayan, at 
ito ang lakas na magtataas ng 
bandilang pilipino sa larangan 
ng paklkitunggali. Hindi sapat 
ang pagkakaroon ng katalinu- 
han ng isang bansa upang si- 
ya'y makapamuhay nang mati- 
wasay at tahimik, kundi kaalin- 
sabay nito’y kinakailangang 
magtaglay siya ng malalakas na 
hukbong pangkatihan, pangda- 
gat at panghimpapawid na ka- 
rakarakang makapagsasangga- 
Jang sa kapakanan at kalayaan 
ng bayan, sakaling hamakin o 
gagahin ng kapuwa bayan. Sa 
pamamagitan pg maayos na pa- 
latuntunan ng paghahanda ng 
ating ianggulang Bansa na nag- 
aatas sa bawa’t lalaking pilipino 
na may gulang na dalawangpung 
taon na sapllitang magsanay sa 
pagkakawal upang mabihasa sa 
iba’t ibang karunungan sa paki- 
kidlgma, ay mabubuu sa Isang 
di .malayong hinaharap ang mga 
sandatahang may sapat na la- 
kas at kadalubhasaan sa pakiki- 
tunggali^ may sapat na kakaya- 
hang makapagpapanatili sa ka- 
panatagan ng bayan, at may sa- 
pat na katibayang makatatawag 
ng pagpipitagan ng ibang mga 
bansa, Sa namamagitan ng pag- 
sasanay ^ mga lalaking pilipi- 
no, ay makikintal sa puso’t pag- 
iisip ng mga ito ang pagpapaka- 
giting, atig pagpapakabayani at 
ang pagpapakatapat na anak ng 



‘ bayan na handang maghandog 
ng dugo at buhay sa kapakanan 
at karangalan ng tinubuang lu- 
pa. 

Pangatlo: Ang pagpapalusog ng

Sa harap ng naghababalang 
kagipitan at pananalat sa mga 
pangunahing kailangan sa buhay. 
nd maaaring pagsamantalahan 
ng mga mangangalakal na Uayu- 
han o hindi man, dahll sa kasa- 
lukuyang pagbabaka ng maraming 
bansa sa Europa na pinakiki- 
pagkalakalan ng bansang ito, ang 
ginagav/ang pagtulong ng Mala, 
sariling Pam'ahalaan sa ikalulu- 
sog at Jkaluluwag ng kabnha- 
yan ng mga mainamayan, at sa 
ikapananatili ng katamtamang 
halaga ng mga kailanganing 
pangaraw-araw ng mga tao, ay 
di maikakailang nakasagip sa ti- 
yak na paghihikahos at pagkaka- 
gutom ng sangbayanang pilipino.

ceidain irregularities which he 
committed in the discharge of his

The judge was charged with 
having refused to take the con-

sons and with having charged a 
fee of fO.80 in cases where he 
actually took the confessions. He 
was also charged with having 
dismissed a criminal case against 
several Moros because the offend- 
ed party and his counsel arrived 
three minutes late for the trial. 

In the first case, the scretary 
of justice was .satisfied that the 
charge arose merely out of mis- 
interpretation of the law on the 
part of the respondent. In the 
second case, the secretary of jus-

Pampanga Under Calamity Rale 

r ' ‘- ^ "'•" Cl-'^ 

Quezon Places Flooded Province Under 
Law Penalizing Profiteering , 



In view of the havoc which the 
recent flood has wi'ought among 
the inhabitants of Pampanpw-Pre 
ident Quezon today issued a pro- 
clagmation declaring the existence 
of a public calamity in the pro- 
vince and prohibiting the hoarding 
of prime necessities and their sale 
at exhorbitant prices. 

The President’s proclamation 
came as various agencies of the 
government continued to repair 
the damage caused by the inunda- 
tion and render relief to the thou- 
sands who have been rendered 
homeless or otherwise adversely 
affected by the flood. 

The anti-profiteering provision 
of the law invoked by the Pres- 
ident declaring the existence of a 
public calamity in the province 
states that prime necessities shall 
not be sold at prices 25 per cent 



or more higher than the prices 
which were current in the differ- 
ent localities one month before the 
disaster occurred. 

The President’s proclamation 
follows; 

“Having found tjiat the flood 
which recently occurred in the 
province of Pampanga has wrought 
havoc among the inhabitants there- 
of, I, MANUEL, L. QUEZON, 
President of the Philippines, by 
virtue of the powers conferred up- 
on .me by section one of Act 
Numbered Pour thousand one 
hundred and sixty-four, entitled 
‘An Act to prevent the excessive 
increase in the prices of certain 
prime necessities of life on the 
occasion of a public calamity, pe- 
nalizing the violation thereof, and 
for other purposes,’ do hereby pro-, 
claim that a public calamity exists

Hay que sentar la regia de que no se puede comer a 
la vez a dos carrillos, uno a cuenta del gobierno, y otro

in the pro\'ince of JPampan.^A ns a 
result of said flood and do here- 
by declare in full force and effect 
therein the provisions of Act Num- 
bered Four thousand one hundred 
and sixty-four, which prohibit and 
penalize the hoarding of the prime 
necessities of life and the holding 
of them for sale at prices twenty- 
five per cent or more higher than 
the prices which were current -in 
the different localities one month 
before the disaster occurred. This 
proclamation .shall apply to such 
commodities as rice, palay, corn, 
and building or construction ma- 
terials.” 

In a telephone conversation yes- 
terday with Dr. Antonio G. Par- 
do, assistant to the executive of- 
ficer and secretary’’ of the board. 
Dr. Tirso N. Santos, relief agent 
stationed in Pampanga, confirmed 
reports of extraordinarily high 
prices of prime commodities in the 
flooded areas. Dr. Santos declared 
that profiteering is rampant in va- 
rious municipalities especially Ara- 
yat. Reports from other sources ‘ 
state that the price of rice has 
increased from 28 to 35 centavos 
per ganta. 

Meanwhile, it was learned that 
henceforth the National Social 
Security administration may be 
given sole authority to recom- 
mend the proclamation of a state 
of public calamity’’ in any province 
visited by disaster. This move, it 
was said, is deemed feasible in 
view of the facilities of the NSSA 
to survey the areas affected. The 
NSSA may also be authorized to 
determine the period of revocation 
of the order and recommend the 
same to the President. 

A constant supply of relief sup- 
plies especially food and shelter 
materials is being sent to the 
flood-stricken areas by the NSSA. 
Rice and canned goods have been 
sent to Calumpit and Paombong, 
Bulacan where more than a dozen 
munici^-alities are facing hunger 
as a /esult of the ffoo^.

Superficially, the 
Manuel United States has 
be.en placed in a 
somewhat embar- 
rassing* position 
em by the grant of 
dictatorial powers 
to President Quezon of the Philip- 
pine Comnionwealth, He was able 
to push a bill through the Hationai 
Assembly -with only one dissenting 
vote, under which he may exercise 
most unusual emergency powers. 
He will have control over all indus- 
try, private and public. He may 
sequester property, regulate com- 
modity prices, fix xeuts, forbid 
.strikes and lockouts and take “all 
necessary measures^^ to suppress 
evspionage and other subversive 
activity. In short, Manuel Quezon 
is the dictator of the Philippine 
Islands, so far as its domestic 
affairs are concerned. His- excuse 
is that the world situation is suet 
that a one-man government is nec- 
essary. 

At first glance, this would seem 
to create an a%vkward situation for 
the United S*tates, which, until 
1946, wll not grant the Islands 
complete independence. We might 
well be charged with inconsistency. 
On one hand we assail dictator- 
ships and decry their spread; on 



the other we permit it in one of tern, 

St, Louis (Mo.) Globe-Democrat 



our island possessions. Under the 
circumstances, however, President 
Quezon’s totalitarianism is not as 
sinister as it sounds. 

Por the time being it is probably 
necessary that one competent head 
of government assume direction of 
island affairs, free from the bicker- 
ings and petty quarrels that have 
, caused turbulence in the Philip- 
I pines for years. With an aggres- 
sive Japan showing every symptom 
of eagerness to extend its influence 
south of China, with the known 
facts of its economic and political 
penetration of the Islands, it is no 
doubt wise that authority be cen- 
tralized to meet the emergency. 
That such centralization will cease 
wJieii the eniergeiicy passes, is 
understood. We may be certain 
the Washington government is 
assured oh this point. 

In fact, the Philippine action vio- 
lates no democratic tenet, no more 
than did the action of tlie British 
Parliament in extending vast emer- 
gency powers to Prime ^ Minister 
Churchill. Britons surrendered no 
independence, as it was clearly 
stipulated that with the end of the 
w^r the status quo ante will be 
restored. This is doubtless tlie sit- 
uation as it pertains to Manuel 
Quezon* the Islands’ dictator pro

MALACA/^AN 

Wary of Politics 

President Declares "Hands 
Oft" On Politics 

Ever since 1935, shortly after as- 
suming the presidency, President 
Quezon has been declaring his in- 
dependence of politics. Up to last , 
week, his pplitical followers were 
still dogging, him to break his 
policy. . / _ > 

Every election year, the presiden- 
tial blessing on a candidate has 
been^ as persistently sought as the 
holy grail. This is because such 
an indorsement has generally been 
better than any other political 
capital including high personal 
qualifications and money. 

This year, the President defined 
his attitude to politics somewhat 
more clearly though more precar- 
iously. He would listen, but he 
would see or hear nothing — and 
would not anoint any candidate. 
Under this policy, he attended prov- 
incial conferences, invited con- 
ferees to Malacahan. Attentive- 
ly, he listened. But always, he 
adjourned each * conference with 
the announcement that the provin- 
cial chapters of the Nationalist 
party must decide for themselves 
unlpss they are willing to abide by 
the decision of the central execu- 
tive committee. 

Last week, provincial leaders an- 
nounced repeatedly that they would 
persist in securing presidential de- 
cision on factional quarrels. As 
persistently, the President or his 
spokesmen announced that he 
would refuse to change his policy 
of divorcing himself from politics.

QUEZON URGES 
ECONOMY";; 

To avoid unnecessary accumul- 
ation of excessive stock of sup- 
plies and equipment in govern- 
ment bureaus and offices. Presi- 
dent Manuel L. Quezon last night 
issued an executive order direct- 
ing the general auditing office to 
take over and store all unused 
supplies, materials, furniture and 
equipment of the government. 

The order was for the purpose 
of effecting a stricter supervision, 
and control in the purchase of 
supplies and materials in order 
I that expenditure for this purpose 
' may be made with “utmost. econ- 
omy.” 

It has been found that many

* unused materials and equipment 
<jan be repaired and recondition- 
ed at httie cost, and yet the gov- 
ernment at present buys a large* 
number of new supplies for its 
bureaus and offices.

’ The Philippine 

Philippine N’ationai Assembly 

Dictator? ^ 

reading Sunday a 

measure vesting dictatorial powers 
,in. that commonwealth's president, 
Manuel Quezon. The hill requires its 
t^Reficiafy ’s official approval, but 
that is taken for granted since he 
asked for the authority it conveys, 
in a special message to the assembly. 

Under its terms as described in 
Manila dispatches, the Philippine 
president gets these among other 
powers: He can draft able-bodied 

citizens for farm labor or any other 
service; take over farm lands and 
industrial establishments; control 
wages and profits in all lines of busi- 
ness; regulate working hours for 
everybody; distribute labor and 
services arbitrarily; commandeer 
ships or any other means of irnns- 
portation; regulate prices and rents. 

The extraordinary grant is based 
upon the assumption of dire crisis 



in the Philippines, caused^ of course, 
by worldwide conditions. As worded 
it is said to vest the absolute con- 
trols in Mr. Quezon until the close 
of the next session of the national 
assembly — ^which means for the dura- 
tion of his present term of office. 

Whether such a sweeping master- 
ship over the affairs of a democratic 
commonwealth is justified by present 
conditions is being debated already 
in the Philippines. Only one vote 
was cast against the measure, its 
single opponent contending that the 
grant violates the Philippine consti- 
tution’s spirit. Many democratic- 
minded Filipinos doubtless share that 
belief. But whether they like it or 
not, the Pliilipx^ine people, bound by 
their National Assembly for the 
period of the emergency,” will 
have to ^^wait and see” what Pres- 
ident Quezon doe.s with bus new and 
practically unlimited powers over 
their livelihood, property and w.ay 
of living. - '

WHY MOT BY APPOINTMBNT? 



S OON after the inauguration of the Com- 
monwealth, President “Quezon tried to 
divorce himself from politics. He has 
been trying: ever since, but lesser politicians 
have not left him alone. 

Provincial political leaders continue to 
plead for his personal support of specific can- 
didates. This they do because they are aware 
of the alacrity with which voters cast their 
ballots in favor of men duly anointed and 
blessed by Malacanan. In this fact is the germ 
of an anti-democratic disease. Where the laws 
reserve to the sovereign people the power to 
elect their officials, the people themselves ab- 
dicate this power, and insist that the Pres-

ident decide for them. This is tantamount to 
converting elective officials into mere ap- 
pointees of the executive. If this has to be 
the case, why not abolish all elections? 

Whenever a nation has sat down to write a 
Constitution, it has tried to embody two ob- 
jectives in tile supreme law; protection of the 
people from their rulers who may abuse their 
authority; and protection of the people from 
themselves when, in hysteria or ignorance or 
apathy, they may sun’ender their sovereignty 
to the rulers. Something of the latter is hap- 
pening in the Philippines to-day, and it is 
gi-atifying to note that the President is re- 
solved to stop it.

As President of the Philippines, 
Quezon has ceased to be the active 
head"' of the Netionalista Party, 
He has however taken indirect 
participation in patching up poli- 
tichl rivalries . among candidates 
for provincial governors belong-

Prei-ident QUEZON 
ing to the Nationalista Part.y. 
1 q most provinces, he has seen to 
it that no prvsure was made to 
bear upon the aspirants which act 
of the President is tantamount to 
dec’a“irg those provinces as free 
zones. This means that the party 



in power will not exert efforts 
nor influence in favor of any one i 
of the candidates. I 

The decision of Pre.sident Que- 
zon to remain neutral in the 
coming Decern ner elections is a 
stroke of statesmanship. He is 
President of the Philippines and 
he must only lock after the wel 
fare of the whole people of hig 
CO inlry and not the welfare of a 
particular part.y. According to 
him, the Constitution of the Phi- • 
lippines has conferred upon suffi- 
cient powers to suspend an.v 
governor who violates any laws of 
the country and for this reason, 
there is no need for him to favor 
any particular candidate. He fur- 
ther said in a public speech that 
any candidate who will be elected 
will receive full cooperation from 
him and from the Government, If 
this promise of President Quezon 
to remain neutral during the 
December elections is comnlied, 
it looks that there will be plenty 
of surprises after the elections. 
Because it cannot be denied that 
there are still candidates for go- 
vernors in many provinces vjho 
have been-accuBtoraed to receiving 
aid from .Mr. Quezon whose word 
means certain victory to the can- 
didate favored by the President. 
At any rate, the country has 
advroced one step in the way for 
a more demooratic'election.

The Malaysian Fete j,f, 

’l/'ERY few civic events in recent years here have 
» been as brilliantly successful, or as memorable, as 
the Malaysian Fete which the “Chicas” unit of the joint 
Boy and Girl Scouts Citizenship Fund Campaign put 
across in Malacanan Park last Saturday. • Judged by 
any standard, the affair was a superb- aehifevemenL 

Many factors, undoubtedly, contributed to the suc- 
cess of the benefit fiesta. For one thing, the “Chicas” 
iznit really worked hard days on end to assure that 
nothing would be amiss in the smooth carrying out of 
the plans for entertainment and accommodation of the 
guests. Then, the President lent it the warmth of his 
personality by tarrying long during the evening, prov- 
ing his deep interest in the worthwhile enterprises that 
are the Boy and Girl Scouts of the Philippines. 

The main factor, however, responsible for the suc- 
cess of the occasion was Ivliss Maria Aurora Quezon’s 
indefatigable leadership throughout the days of plan- 
ning and preparation. As her first venture in civic 
'work on a large scale, she put her heart into it,; and her 
efforts were well rewarded. She deserves the congra- 
yalations of the public as do the Boy and Girl Scouts 
executive of dcials, and the “Chicas” unit.

of Camarines Sur for not letting tfiewc^ of the pro-anti fight heal, urging them to present a 
front as an undivided party and not as scattered factional groups. 

Hernandez. 

President Quezon, in emphasiz- 
ing his non-partisanship, recalled 
that when ex-Governor Gabriel 
Prieto, whose son is now the an- 
tis’ candidate for governor, was 
the provincial executive, he lent 
every support to him, but when 
he was defeated by Governor 
Hernandez, a pro, he gave the 
latter the same measure of sup- 
port. The President, incidental- 
ly, took occasion to voice his sat- 
isfaction with the adniinistration 
of Governor Hernandez. 

He gave assurance that he will 
not interfere, directly or indirect- 
ly, for the election of any can- 
didate. He advised the people 
that in these times of crises, 
they must think only of helping 
one another, inst^d of engaging 
in petty political quarrels. 

'"You must understand,’* he said 
*That I am personally interested 
only in the amelioration of the 
Bicolano people, and that I have 
no further political objective in 
life except to prepare the people 
for an independent existence.” 
The President, who seemed 
bothered by a hoarse voice, spoke 
extemporaneously in English, 
with Sabido translating his 
words into the dialect. Gover- 
nor Hei-nandez, who introduced ' 
the President, urged^ him to lend 
ear to the insistent’ demands of 
the ^people for his reelection to ' 
the '^presidency. 



the fixat alumni pins will be given, 
to the lionor guests will be the. 
main feature of the festivities , 

A whole day program has been 
prepared by the committee in 
charge headed by Dr, Jose Ma, 
Delgado, president of the U.S.T. 
alumni association. A solemn 
mass will be said at 9 ajm. after 
which the U.S.T. R.O.T.C. cadet 
corps will hold a review. 

A receptioja will follow with Rev, 
Pr. Silvestre Saneho, O. P., rector 
magniftofus, as host. An open 
house will be held, and games 
played by the sons of the alumni 
on the campus. The banquet will 
be held at noon. - 

Closing the day’^s festivities, 
President and Mrs. Manuel L. Que- 
zon will play hosts at a tea and 
reception to be held at Malacahan j 
at 5 p.m^ j 

, j 



Addressing a crowd of 10,000 in 
the Naga plaza shortly after his 
arrival by motor from Legasp-i. 
Albay, the President cited as an 
example to local Nacionalistas 
the case of his administra- 
tion, in which appointments are 
made without consideration of 
pro or anti affiliations. 

But great as the President’s 
concern was over the lingering 
pro-anti division in this province, 
he stated clearly that he will not 
intervene politically in any man- 
ner in the selection of the Na- 
cionalista* candidate, but will 
leave the decision to the elec- 
torate, supporting whichever can- 
didate, be he pro, anti or opposi- 
tionist, is elected by the people. 

The President arrived here at 
6 p. m. from Legaspi, and after 
addressing the public meeting 
left in a special train for Mani- 
la. He arrived with, a party in- 
cluding* ex-Assemblyman Pedro 
Sabido and Assemblyman Pedro 
Vera, and was welcomed by local 
officials and 'Nacionalista leaders, 
headed by Governor Andres T.’

and will not change Sabido for polit- 
ical consideration. 

Moreover the hemp corporation is 
a government entity w'ith public 
character and objectives. Whoever is 
elected governor of Albay- will havo 
to cooperate •with Sabido towards 
achieving the purpose of tho corpora- 
tion or else he will have to answer 
to me for his lack of cooperation. If 
tlie corporation fails you ■w*ill find 
yourselves again in the horrible situa- 
tion when yon had to allow your hemp 
plantations to rot and the government 
not again appropriate funds in 
attempt to help yon. This is your 
last chance and the only chance that 
you have to become once more one of 
the most yn-osperous provinces in the j 
archipelago. ! 

^‘Get together and save the hemp 
industry which means the saving of 
your o'UTi lives. ’ ’

NAG A, Camarines Sur, Oct. 20. 
— President Quezon addressing the |

Kaga this evening, said the local j 
electors can select their own can- j

He stated that his main purpose in 
visiting the province is not to -settle 
the party conflicts but to look into 
the needs of the people .

Food Supply ? ' 

' In his recent talk to the Nation, PresiilfiiijLJIiuiuel 
h. Quezon urg’ed the people to increase food production! 
Ihe President's Warning is important because the Phil- 
ippine supply of rice from abroad is very uncertain. 

^ Hie Philippines is facing a maior problem, and 
that is, ^ tlifi problem of food, supply. The Islands cannot 
be doubted as an ^agricultural country, but the fact 
•' cannot be also denied that the Philippine agiiculture 
is backward. It is backward because the government 
has been very slow, if not indifferent, in extending to 
the small Filipino farmers the heeded aid. 

It is noyr highly in order to narrow down the gap 
that has been existing between the government and the 
Filipino farmers. Scientific cultivation is needed, and 
the instruction of the farmers in this direction should 
be made without cost and with the best intention.

After his speech he proceeded to 
the house . of Govenior Hernandez 
to rest. He left for Manila at 6:30 
this evening . 



EHCENA, Tayabas, Oct. 19.— The

mittee of the Nacionalista party an

dates an amicable settlement of the

Presidejit Quezon ^s Warning 



C^ 



'Y'HE perennial charge of the Oppositionists that the 
-»• administraUve officials of the government are 
using their position to influence the results of popular 
elections here has been forestalled by President Que- 
zon as far as the expected crop of alibis of the Oppo- 
sitmn groups who will be defeated in the December 10 
poll is concerned. 

In a bluntly-spoken address in the capital build- 
ing in noilo,>.^esidenj:„Q,ug 2 pn.^, w the justices of 

the peace, constabulary and police officers against 
electioneering, threatened with suspension whoever 
would be found disregarding his warning. 

President Quezon has consistently fought against 
the corruption of the ballot that has become part and 
parcel of popular elections. He has launched a cam- 
paign against the evils of the party system even going 
to the extent of advocating the abolition of political 
parties. 

All those who are deeply concerned over the 
healthy growth of the democratic system in this coun- 
try should be on the alert to expose those who disre- 
gard the President’s warning in Iloilo.

President Quezon Points the Way 

TN.the longest and most comprehensive message that 
•i he has sent to the National Assembly, President 
Quezon presented to the nation last night a document 
of such breadth and depth and magnitude that it will 
remain as one of the great sta.te papers of the Com- 
monwealth Governmev. : . 

This is the last regular session of the Second Na- 
tional ^sembly, and the last year of President Que- 
zojrvS six-year administration. Ther’e was ample rea- 
son^r thei^fore, to make a definitive and thorough re- 
view of the accomplishments of the government dur- 
• ing the past more than five years, to indicate the mea- 
sures and policies most needful to be established in the 
■face of the troubled, condition of the world, and to mark 
'-‘■eleariy once again the course that the Filipino people 
should' follow resolutely towards independence. 

^ . . President Quezon speaks with just pride of what 
“'the government has done in promoting all the essen- 
tial aspects of the people’s daily living. The record on 
the subject is indeed so clear that the long and exhaus- 
tive review which constitutes the main body of the 
. message is no more than a summary supported in each 
.'.part by easily available evidence. The work that has 
. been .accomplished in national defense, education, 
health and sanitation, public works, industrial, com- 
. mercial and agricultural promotion, etc., has been such 
“as to justify the estimate often made: that as much 
if not more has been done in these fields during the 
five years under the Commonwealth than during the 
entire preceding period of nearly three decades of the 
. Tones. Law regime. 

If the President speaks with reasonable pride of 
the record of his administration, he does not at the 
same time ignore the magnitude of the problems that 
yet remain to be'holved. He realizes only too keenly 
.. thafer tdie search for a solution to many of these prob- 
^l^ss ’has been and will continue to be badly hampered 

the disturbed international situation. For one 
vPiing, the disruption of our foreign trade has made 
virtually impossible any. planning ahead such as we 
might have done in normal times when most of the 
factors involved are either known or predictable. 

Faced with circumstances beyond any man’s con- 
trol, “the President hazards no prophecies, and instead 
sticks to realities — to the immediately perceptible 
problems and. needs of the people. Since it is impos- 
sible to foretell what exactly will happen in the next 
few years or even months, our whole duty, according 
to President Quezon, is to satisfy the needs of the 
people’s daily living. Broadly, these needs fall into five 
main groups; food, shelter and clothing; health, sani- 
tation and public- welfare; economic prosperity and 
financial solvency; social justice and national defense; 
(^ucation and culture. 

or no war, our people will have to live some- 
how: eat, be clothed and sheltered, work, and enjoy 
themselves as best as the circumstances allow. The 
President is not so distraught by the noise outside as 
to .forget the things most essential to the people’s life 
fe hny kind of weather. It is remarkable indeed how, 
in the reconamendations to the National Assembly, the 
.eatthy words like rice, relief, drought, crops, fisheries, 
Mdrk, occur again and again. ' 

If the President clearly recognizes this as one of the 
■naaiterable facts of community living and of govern- 
ment, he speaks of one other fact with the mention of 
which he closes his message: that there is only one 
door 6pen for the Filipino people, one goal left to- 
wards which they must aspire, one guerdon which they 

a right and a duty to win. This goal, this guer- 

is independence and the road leading to it and the 
door that opens to it still stand before our people, des- 
pite everything, like a living and inescapable challenge. 

President Quezon has rendered an account of his 
stewardship of the nation. No Filipino can read this 
long and comprehensive story without thinking of 
the man who has lived it and told it — with real ' affec- 
tion and gratitude, and with eveiy genuine hope that 
his stewardship will continue beyond these trying and 
perilous

CABINET TALKS 
CONVICT LABOR 



Matter Is Left To 
President For 
Decision 



Tlic cabinet yestenlar decided to 
submit to President,. Quezon the ejues- 
tloji of whether convict labor may be 
used iu the coiistriictioii of public 
works iu the provinces, especially 
roads. Tlie matter was brought up 
yesterday at the regular meetiiig of 
the cabinet presided over by Vice 
President Osmeii.a. but as it involves 
an imj'iortant govern 111 ent policy it 
was thought better to leave it to the 
chief executive for final decision. 

^ .It was stated that provincial offi- 
cials have suggested the advisability 
of using insular prisoners iu goveru- 
; ment works, lieeause if this is done 
' the Eilihid prison -will be relieved of 
I its congestion and prisoners W’oiild 
be given useful ^york to do, 

TJiis practice was allowed sometime 
ago but it was discontinued because 
it has been cjiarged that, prisoners 
, when taken out of Manila were 
allowed to live in private 'homes and ; 
treated as if they were free men.* 

' President Quezon then had objected 
to the using of prisoners in jiublic 
works. 

The cabinet yesterday decided to 
adopt the 1918 census upon, which 
to base the distribution of govern- 
ment revenues among the provinces. 
The law’ provides the distribution 
based on population but although a 
new’ census has been taken it has not 
; l)een completed, hence the decision to 
I adopt the last official census, that of 
! 1918.

QUEZON SIGNS 



Measure Voting F300,000 
To Finance Plantations 
Becomes Law 



Bill 3110 providing* for an appro- 
priation of P300,000 to finance the 
establishment of cinchona plantations 
in public forests was signed by Pres- 
ident Quezon yesterday. It becomes 
act 646. 

The coconut oil excise tax ^budget 
which was approved by the President 
this week provides for an outlay of 
P150,000 for the same purpose. Since 
tlie two measures cover the same point 
or objective and since there is a dis- 
crepancy in the sums made available, 
it was reliably in’dicated last night 
that the P150,000 already authorized 
for expenditure in the oil tax budget 
will be created into a revolving fund 
and made ready for release. The 
sum lacking may be made up, by a 
subsequent appropriation by the * as- 
sembly, either in a separate law or 
in the next budget for the oil tax. 

There are 36 more legislative meas- 
ures pending action of the chief ex- 
ecutive inclu'dihg some of the most 
important bills passed during the re- 
cent session such as the appropriation 
bills (general appropriation and the 
public works bill), the election law, 
the reorganization of the electoral 
commission, the national housing, the 
registration and fingerprinting of 
aliens and the rice tenancy law amend- 
ment biUs. The maternity leave bill 
is scheduled to be approved during 
the week-end. 

Contrary to expectation, there will 
be vetoes of measures, it was gath- ; 
ered yesterday. There W'ere no indi- ' 
cations, however, regarding the iden- 
tity of the measures duo for. disap- 
proval.

Addressed By Abad Santos 

The conference of judges, dis- 
trict attorneys and fiscals opened

gram reads in part: 

‘‘Immediately judges, district at- 
torneys and fiscals opened , their 
-conference this morning under the 
chairmanship of the secretary of

ing President Quezon, Speaker

mon Avancena, expressing to them ‘ 
the best wishes of the conferees 
offering their cooperation and 
further congratulating Pre.Mdent

“The conference has formed 
committees to take up studies of 
the rules of court in operation, 
the reorganization of the judicia- 
ry, the revision of the schedule of t 
courts, sheriff fees and the public- 
ation of court and sheriff’s no- 
tices. Committees immediately

Mansion House ar.d its gardens, referring to the picture pre- 
sented hy the myriads of lights employed as decorative notes at 
the formal dance given by President aiicl Mrs. Manuel L. Quezon 
for their second daughter — tall, daik-eyedLZraeida (Nini) Quezon. 
The dance served as a belated birthday celebration for the guest 
of honor, who was twenty years old last Wednesday, April ninth. 
There were about two hundred guests, many of them from the 
j’ounger sets, who for the most ])art made the trip to Baguio

Miss Quezon wore a pearl-gray slipper satin frock with gored 
skirt, shirred front, and bolero, a porcelain brooch and a cattleya 
orchid corsage furnishing touches of color. For this, the largest, 
party yet to be given in her honor, she abandoned her extremely 
simple hair-do for an equally becoming but a bit more elaborate 
style. 






Warning to Workers 

Employees and laborers of the Ma- 
nila Port Teiariinal have been warned 
by the collector of customs they are 
virtually government employees, and 
that if they go on strike they will be 
“considered dismissed from the service 
without right to reinstatement/’ in ac- 



cordance with a policy laid down by 
President Manuel L. Quezon on strikes 
in- go*/ ernment firms. 

He iilsG ^"'ated that “the positions 
held by the men, if they strike, will 
forthwith be lilled with other emplo- 
yees and laborers.”

Tlie national board of Catliolic 
Action in the Phili 2 )piiies is spoil* 
soriiig a natiom\dde campaign for 
funds ivliicli 'vvill be undertaken 
jointly by tlie Catholic Women 
League and the Knights of Colum- 
bus. ilrs. Aurora A. Quezon and 
Mrs. Esperauza L. Osmeha are 
honorary, president and vice pres- 
ident, respectively, of the executive 
committee in charge of the cam-

sailors now detailed in the Philip- 
pines. 

The home for unwed mothers 
will house the women and take care 
of their babies. The home for 
convalescent poor women and chil- 
dren is intended for the indigent 
who," on leaving the free wards ot 
a hospital, need to recuperate in 
quiet and pleasant surroundings. 

The Catholic Youth organization 
counts with hundreds of poor boys 
and young men from several dis- 
tricts in Manila. Members of this 
organization are given a balanced 
program of spiritual, cultural, 
physical and social activities. The 
Knights of Golumbiis’ clubhouse is 
being used by these children at 
present. A bigger^ building is 
needed, it was explained. 

A new activity which will be 
' undertaken by the board is the 
1 entertainment of the American 
soldiers and sailors now detailed in 
I the Philippines. Picnics and parties 
'are being planned by the board.

Labor Today 



This jear is critical for labor. By organ- 
ization long fought for and with difficulty 
gained, by the enlightenment of the masses, 
by increasing recognition of the rights of the 
worker by the state, by the growing sympath- 
etic attitude on the part of capitalist elements 
towards the problems of their partner in in- 
dustry, labor today stands on the threshold of 
a. new era, free from exploitation and bright 
with the promise of social justice. At the 
same time, by the frenzied inarch of reaction- 
ary forces in Europe and the Far East, by tlie 
collapse of democracies caught unprepared for 
the struggle, by the extending influence of a 
way of life that will make impossible the con- 
tinuation of the \vorkers’ fight for rJghts, labor 
stands on the bi’fnk of ivaetion dark with the 
threat of the Joss of all that labor has pain- 
fully gained in long decades of struggle. 

Philippine labor has only recently begun 
the fight for rights that foreign labor had 
long maintained. It has, specially under the 
. Commonwealth and the administration of Pres- 
ident Manuel Quezon, made rapid gains, al- 
thtmgit hot'tvithout-opposition from capital.. To- 
■ day the two are at odds in many of our prov- 
inces and cities. It would be most unfortunate 
for labor as well a.s for capital that in the 
midst of this struggle the totalitarian enemies 
should* march in and find the two disunited 
and unprepared to resist a common enemy, an 
enemy that will enslave them both. 

If the totalitarian way of life is imposed 
by the might of arms in the Far East, labor 
shall have again become a slave without or- 
ganization, without rights, without voice. 

Labor has not yet gained all its rights, but • 
it is inevitable that it will gain them mthin a. 
dew-ocratic state. Education in a democracy 
makes it Impossible for labor, to remain ex- 
ploited. It is merely a matter of ti^^e, but the 
workers will win . their rightful place in the 
scheme of commerce, agriculture, and industry, 
with <-he consent of capital perhaps, without 
the consent of capital if need be. 

But this struggle for rights so sure to be 
crowned with success within a democratic state 
must cease in a totalitarian regime for the sim- 
. pie reason that it will be stopped by force by 
the all-powerful dictator. It is important that 



labor continue, the fight for justice in the 
distribution of the benefits of production. ^ It 
is even more important at: the present time 
that it wage a fight together, with other ele- 
ments In the state against the totalitarian 
monster.. _... . '

Assemblymen Scratch Heads Over 
Implications Of A Few Measures 



By CIFEIANO CIB 



Tilt} importance and implications 
of some of the legisltive measures 
due for enactment by the present 
session of the ^sembly have im- 
pressed a number of assemblymen 
but they offered the reasoning last 
night that the emergency situation 
and the conditions obtaining in the 
country justify them. 

There was unanimous support of 
measures sought by the administra- 
tion to bolster national defense, 
especially those referring to the 
securing of an aggregate loan of 
P300,000,000, f200,000,000 from the 
American Import-Export Bank and 
another ?100,000,000 from the fed- 
eral treasury under the leaso-leud 
act. 

The Import-Export Bank loan 
would be utilized in financing the 
exchange of ^ goods between the 
United States and the Philippines 
in event of blockade and to enable 
the Islands. to buy in advance suf- 
ficient quantities of essential arti- 
cles which might be needed in case 
of emergency. 

The P100,006,000 sought under the

Cierre de centres 
de recreo segun 
horas ma rcadas 

Estricta aplicacion de la oiden 
ejecutiva que dispone el cierre 
de los centres de recreo a la 1:0Q 
de la madrugada en los dias re- 
* gu lares y a las 2:00 en los do- 
roihgos y dias de fiesta oficial, 
fue ordenada por el President e 
Manuel L. Quezon en una coJiTcr— 
liTca^on SivIaHaT'kl Departemen- 
to del Interior trasmitida por 
conducto del Secretai io ^orge B. 
Vargas.

ser .instados a dejar el lugar. 

Malacahang pide que la ])olicia 
y la Constabularia fueraii comi- 
sionadas para hacer cumplir la 
orden estrictamente. 

Teniendo en cuenta q<ie la or- 
d^n ejecutiva fue dictada para 
regular la operacion de los cen- 
tios de recreo, se ban estado re- 
cibiendo en el Deparraniento del 
Interior denuncias de haberse in- 
fringido la orden. Esto.s informe.s 
parece que llcgaron a la Oficina 
del Presidente de Filipinos. 



lend-leaso act will be spent in the 
United States for the purchase of 
arms and munitions. Separate leg* 
islative enactments grauUiig author- 
ity to President Quezon to jiego- 
tfate these loans are duo for enact- 
ment. 

These measures arc generally 
understandable but there are a few 
others slated for passage that puzzle 
some assemblymen and regular gal- 
lery visitors. These include tlie 
proposal to authorize President 
Quezon to buy the Jai-Alai estab- 
lishment, a proposal which has been 
severely criticized by the Civil 
Liberties Union; the similar gov- 
ci-nment operation of two race 
tracks, and the abolition of the 
department of the interior. 

Secretary Vargas offered the 
explanation last night tliat the 
Jai-Alai and the facing clubs arc 
and have been making lots of , 
money and a few individuals have | 
been enriched by their operation. 
He said tlie government might as 
well take them over and use the 

profits derived tliercfroin for pur- 
poses of charity. He said that the 
' operation of the sweepstakes by 
the government has proven to be . 
successful and beneficial. 

The acquisition of Jai-Alai and 
the race tracks by the government 
might involve expense of from 
P4, 000, 000 to Po, 000,000 of public 
funds, it was understood. The 
I money needed for their purchase 
might bo taken from the proceeds 
1 of the sweepstakes. 

I The plan to abolish the interior 

department brought to mind one of | 
the causes of the recent political | 
crisis which threatened to disrupt } 
the harmonious relations between j 
the President and the assembly, it 






was "understood the lcgislati\ c lead 
ers granted the department of the ■ 
interior abolished because.' of its dis- 
like for the incumbent department | 
head, Eafael E. Aluuan. 

This crisis blew over and it was 
then believed that the whole matter 
had been dissolved and forgotten. 
The tesuscitatioii of the meagre 
and indications that it will go- 
through have upset these cxpccta-J 
tions. 

Although the final draft of the 
bill amending the election law so as . 
to give the commission on^ election.s ( 
the power to name election inspectors _ 
lias yet to be finished, it is believed / 
that* a compromise can be readied • 
satisfactory to both executive and,' 
legislative branches. Assemblymen 
are for retaining the> present arrange-- 
ment under whicli the majority party 
controls two of the three inspectors 
while the runner-up political party , 

- gets ' one. The administration pro-^ 
poses to have the commission iiamej 
all the inspectors.

More Food! 

President Manuel L. Quezon has 
given his approval to certain recom- 
mendations made by the Civilian 
Emergency Administi-ation regarding 
the protection of the civilian popula- 
tion of the country in the event of war. 
The recommendations include the dis- 
bursement of millions of pesos for the 
purchase of construction- materials and 
food supplies, as well as''the systema- 
tic production of short-teim crops. To 
ensure an adequate supply of food, 
supplies and materials, the Philippine 
purchasing agent will have authority 
to lay in a supply of construction 
materials and office supplies', the h(a- 
tional Food Trading Corp. will be au- 
thorized to buy foodstuffs which mer- 
chants cannot carry in stock; and the 
department of agriculture and com- 
merce, through the bureau of plant in- 
dustry, will be given permission to 
conduct a campaign for the produc- 
tion of short-term crops, and increase 
the acreage in corn, rice and tubem. 
Farmers will be loaned seeds, to bt 
repaid when the crops are harvested.

wad ng mababang kapulungan 
ay naaalinsunod .sa konstitu- 
sion. Sinabing ang bilang^ ng

ay naragdagan, kaya ang bi- 
lang naman ng mga purok ng

ding dagdagan. 

Noong 1907 ay itinakda ng 
Komision Pilipina sa 90,000 
ang bilang ng mga mamama- 
j^an sa bawa’t isang purok na 
l<,akatawanin ng isang mangba- 
batas. Ang batas na ito ay 
umiiral pa, subali’t ang bilang 
ng mga mamamayan ay narag- 
dagang lubha, at ang bilang ng 
mga purok ay gaya rin ng dati 
matangi sa dalawang purok na 
idinagdag nitong mga huling 
taon. “Ang dapat isaalang-

Gettingr Started in Tondo 

T171TH the creation by President Quezon of a com- 
^ mittee to direct the rehabilitation of the Tondo 
fire area, and with the submission by Vice President 
Osmena of the first official recommendation on the 
subject, the deck has been cleared at last for action 
on a matter that, by its vem/ natiu'e, cannot be too 
long delayed. 

It is hardly necessary to emphasize the fact that 
work on the Tondo reconstruction project must start 
at once. A delay of another week or another month 
will create problems and difficulties that will only 
serve to distract the attention and hamper the work 
of the government. As after the 1937 fire, residents 
are once again constructing temporary shelters all over 
the burnt area, and going into debt to do so. 

Nor is it fair wholly to prohibit the construction 
of such shelters since, in a few more days, the public 
school buildings where, the fire victims are now tem- 
porarily sheltered will have to be cleared to permit 
their "use for regular classes. There is obviously not 
much time to lose, unless the government is willing 
to lay aside additional amounts for relief that were 
better spent on the recoiistvirrtir--'' of *he rl’strict itself. 

The report submitted to the President by Mr. 
Osmeha as head of the National Social Security Ad- 
ministration has set an admirable pace and tone for 
the Tondo rehabilitation program. The recommenda- 
tions with respect to the planning of the district, the 
new layout of streets, the building and housing re- 
gulations, the improyeraent of fire-fighting facilities 
are conceived in the modeim scientific spirit and are 
deserving of intelligent attention. 

Mr. Osmena makes much of a point that should 
not be overlooked in any rehabilitation plan for Tondo; 
natnely, the construction of the Manila North Harbor 
along the Tondo beach on which the reclamation work 
is fast nearing completion. With an eye to the future, 
the Osmeha report calls attention to the fact that 
“the problem of proper housing facilities for the mid- 
dle and low-income groups that need accommodation 
near their places of work is an important one that 
requires careful attention.” 

This is a sample of that large and far-reaching 
vision Which will be necessary in public construction 
projects of this type and magnitude. Tondo must be 
rebuilt for tomorrow’s needs — with wider streets, 
more spacious public plazas, better sanitary facilities 
■ — a modern district of which Manila can be proud. 

If we muff this chance, and let Tondo grow once 
more in the old. sprawling way that slums have, we 
may not have another. Hut vve have cut a beautiful 
avenue through Quiapo, and another through Santa 
Mesa. We have built express highways in Quezon city. 
We haye the desire and the experience, and all we 
need to do, it seems, is to make up our minds that 
Tondo can be similarly treated — and probably at com- 
paratively much less cost to the government.

Resignation Of 

Razon Okayed 

Special to the TRIBUNE 

Baguio, May 26. — President 
Quezon today accepted the re- 
signation ot Benito Razon as 
general manager of the Nation- 
al Trading Corp. Expected 
momentarily was a reorganiza- 
tion of the firm. 

Before departing for Manila, 
Secretary Jorge B. Vargas an- 
nounced that NTP may be 
merged with the National Rice 
and Corn Corp., possibly under 
Dr. Victor Buencamino. 

The cooperatives operated by 
the NTC will be placed under 
an agency to be headed by 
either Arsenio N. Luz or Direc- 
tor of Commerce Cornelio Bal- 
maceda, it was indicated. 

Razon, it was learned, will be 
employed by Vicente Madrigal, 
Manila businessmen who recent- 
ly bought the Calamba Sugar 
Estate. 

President Quezon also author- 
ized Auditor General Jaime Her- 
nandez to go on an official trip 
to the United States, where he 
will inspect various Common- 
wealth interests. He is schedul- 
ed to sail on the s.s. ‘‘President 

Coolidge” on June 11. , 

Plans for the enlargement or 
the Philippine Constabulary were 
taken up at a conference in Ba- 
guio last Saturday among Pres- 
ident Manuel L. Quezon, Secreta- 
ry of Defense Leon G. Guinto, 
Secretary Jorge B. Vargas, and 
Brig. Gen, Guillermo B. Francis- 
co. chief of the constabulary. 

The President, it was learned, 
has decided to increase the cons- 
tabulary force to 10,000 men as 
an emergency measure. The 
constabulary at present has a 
strength of 4,500. At one time 
it had' a force of 6,000, the big- 
gest in its histoiT. 

Secretarv Vargas also announc- 
ed that the President has ex- 
tended new appointments to those 
whose appointments the National 
Assembly failed to confirm foi 
lack of time, including Judge 
Felix Angelo Bautista of the Al- 
bay court of first instance, and 
Fiscal Emilio Mayo of Camari- 
nes Norte. 

Tomorrow noon Secretary Var- 
gas is flying to Baguio with Sec- 
retary of Justice Jose Abad San- 
tos and will return Thursday 
morning.

President 
Returning 
To City Today 

Fully Recovered, 
Quezon Arriving 
6 A. Wf- by Train , 

After an ab.sence of two 
months, President Manuel L. 
Quezon is returning to Manila 
at G o^clock this morning on a 
special train from Baguio. 

The President’s physicians 
have found him fully recovered 
from a throat and lung-ailment 
which kept him in bed for near- 
ly five months. The President 
is reportedly desirous to return 
to his desk in Malacaftan, but 
his physicians have advised 
him not to strain himself for 
the time being. 

Secretary Jorge B. Varga.s de- 
clared lost night that he* was 
not aw'are of the President's im- 
mediate plans. It was understood, 
however, that if the trip fioav 
Baguio proves a strain on the 
President^ he may rest for a few 
days in his Marikina residence. 

The President left Baguio at 3 
p. m. yesterday afternoon for Djv' 
mortis, wdiere he boarded a spe- 
cial train last night. The Pre- 
sident’s physicians advised him 
to take his time on the trin to 
avoid fatigue. 

The President will be very 
busy during the next few days, 
it \vas learned. He may appoint 
either today or. tomorrow the 
new deputy collector of internal 
revenue and assistant national 
treasurer. Both positions have 
been vacant for some time, and 
it was reported that the Presid- 
ent wdll choose the appointees 
from among the ranking officials 
in both^offices. 

The President is also working, 
on a speech which he will broad- 
cast to the nation on a date to 
he announced later. The speech 
will touch on President Roose- 
velt’s proclamation of an unlimit- 
ed national emergency in tho 
United States, 

Bills approved by the National 
. Assembly In its last session arc 
also awaiting the President’s nc-j

Time to Decide 



But for the unexpected order of President 
Megjagi Quezon to postpone the opening of clas- 
ses for early July, the school season would now 
ne upon us. Yet today, a few days before the 
announced r'egular beginning of the school- 
jear> and a few weeks before the new delay- 
ed opening, the department of instruction has 
not yet oeen able to decide whether or not it 
will adopt the, quai’terly system this year. 

Hundreds of thousands of students* thous- 



ands of teachers and professors, and hundreds 
Of private schools and universities* wilJ have to 
gear the-3r coming jear’s activities to the sche- 
dule bf the public schools. Their programs 
and schedules for the corning year hang in 
mid-air until some announcement is made by 
the department of instruction that it has adoph 
ed or rejected the quarterly system. 

-tt is significant that while the quarterly 
system was proposed by the government, and 
was merely suggested to the private institu- 
tions of education later, it is the latter which 
have been able to announce their opinions 
on the svstem. A few leading universities 
and colleges have adopted the system; others, 
notably the Catholic institutions, have pre- 
ferred the semestral system. The point is 
tnat within a shorter period than the depart- 
ment of instruction these private institutions 
have been able to study the quarterly system 
and approve or reject the plan. The govern- 
ment, within which the proposal was made, 
can only saj’ that the plan is still “under 
study.” 

At the present time, for example, there 
is in Manila a representative from a Cebu 
university here for the sole purpose of ascer- 
taining from the department of instruction 
whether or not the quarterly system w'ill be 
adopted. He has gone from one department 
official to another; to date, he has received no 
definite reply. 

In the case of the law' colleges, there is 
an oostaeJe to the Quarterly system in a re- 
solution of the ?,upreme Court 'which requires 
that a bur candidate should have studied law 
for four years. While this requirement ap- 
pear.s a technicality in view of the fact ■'hat 
the same number of .subjects will be offered 
an three , years of the quarterly system, yet 
tile Supreme Court, as befits a conservative 
body, does not want to consider a new resolu- 
tion. until an announcement of public policy 
on the subject is issued by the President, the 
Cabinet, or the Jegislatiure. In the meantime 
the law colleges, with only a few days remain- 
ing before the opening of classes, cannot de- 
cide w’hether or not to adopt a system, which, 
to all appearances, was urged upon them by 
the government. . ,, / 

In fairnes.s to students, teachers, and pri- 
'^^te in.stitutions, the department of instruc- 
tion should announce its decision on the mat- 
ter within the next few days.

jJPareides Sees Coalition 

i Speaker Quintin Paredes last

may vote against it. He added that 
the coalition can be regarded as 
go.” 

Senate President Quezon confer- 
\red with former Governor Jesus M. 
Iciienco of Cebu, Representative 
\vicente Rama of the same prov- 
ince, and former Representative 
Baf^nan, at his home last night, 
for more than five hours. The 
Cebu majority leaders and the sen- 
ate president, however, apparent- 
ly failed to reach an agreement, 
and Cuenco and the others in Cebu 
who oppose the coalition will vote 
against it in the convention. Mr, 
.Cuenco will speak against the 
'coalition, it was said. 

However, It was revealed that the 
...n Cebu antis will be 
snowed under by the vote in favor 
of the coalition to be cast by dele- 
gates from other provinces.

El mensaje del Presidente 






T~\IGNA culijiinaeion de la esplendida y grandiose ma- 

nifestacion de lealtad que realize ayer la capital 
de la nacion, fue sin duda aiguna el mensaje del Pre- 
sid6xit§ Quezon a todos los habitantes del Archipielago, 
que guardan en sus pechos respeto y fidelidad a la Pa- 
tna, a sus ideales y sus instituciones. 

Els el primer mensaje al ppeblo que dirige person al- 
mente, a viva voz, el Jefe de nu'estro Gobierno desde 
que la enfermedad le oblige a ausentarse de su despacho 
oficial del Palacio de Malacanang, desde el cual aver 
leyo su discurso a la nacion, con motive del Dia de' la 
Lealtad. 

Lo e:xcepcionai de la ocasion y la importancia mis- 
ma del mensaje requirieron de Su Excelehcia aquel es- 
fuerzo, en medio de los inconvenientes producidos por 
su prolongada reclusion en el lecho de enfermo, y esto 
debemos tener presente para que nos percatemos debi- 
damente de la trascendencia singular no solo del gran- 
dioso desfile de ayer tarde, sino tambien y, principal- 
mente, del contenido del mensaje o discurso presiden- 
cial. Por esto debe leerse con atencion aun por aque* 
llos que lo hayaji eseuebado trasmitido por la radio. 

No cabe destacar como mas importante y digno de 
a.tencion alguno de los conceptos expresados por el Pre- 
sidente, porque, a nuestro juido, todos ellos deben, co- 
mo decimos, leerse y meditarse. 

Al mismo tiempo que en el se nos advlerte de la gra- 
yedad creciente de la situacion creada por el conflicto eu- 
ropeo, no puede mepos de alentarnos la informacion auto- 
rizada, autentica, de que lo que se ba hecho y se esta ha- 
ciendo, en intima colaboracion entre los dos Gobiemos, 
el de la Metropoli y el de las Islas, en orden a nuestra 
. defensa nacional, a nuestros preparatives necesarios pa- 
ra hacer frente a esa gravedad creciente senalada por el 
Jefe Ejecutivo. 

Bien claro dice en su discurso. “Estamos en tiem- 
pos de tensidn y de gran peligro. Todos los filipinos 
deben percatarse de las realidades de la situacion que 
DOS confronta.'* Y luego pimtuaUza las cuestiones que 
principalmente reclaman la atencion de todos los ciu- 
dadanos leales y a las que el ^Gobierno ya ha dado la 
suya. y les sigue prestando. 

S61o nos resta, pues, a los ciudadanos que hemos 
hecho protesta de nuestra lealtad, traducir ese senti- 
miento con actos patentes, realizando los que el Presi- 
dente nos ha sefialado en su m.ensaje. Y no dudamos 
que esto haran todos, que todos estaran en su puesto, y 
en la hora de la mayor necesidad ningimo faltara. La 
incomodidad de ayer fue un sacrificio insignificante sin 
duda aiguna, comparado con el que acaso se nos requie- 
ra en un futuro que no podemos determinar. Pero, 
como decimos, no habra nadie que lo rehuya, contando 
con la asistencia de la Divina I^ovidencia.

GREAT NEWS FOR COMMONWEALTH 

FVERYONE in the Philippines has been cheered by the report 
^ that President Manuel L. Quezon, who has b^n ill lor over 
eight months, is well on the road to health. This is indeed grea 

news for the Commonwealth. 

Now that the President is recuperating, everyone hopes^ 
his “friends” will give him a chance to complete his recovery. 
They can do this by not forcing themselves upon him, by re- 
fraining from troubling him with their petty political cares an 
grievances, by refusing to tire him 

Mr. Quezon should.be given an opportunity to enjoy the rest 
he needs for his health’s sake.

TENANTS REQUEST 
REMEDIAL LAWS 

Denounce Situation In Central 
Luton To President 

Claiming that the agrarian si- 
tuation In central Luzon is worse 
than ever, a delegation of tenant? 
and workers from that region this 
morning submitted a memorandum 
to President Quezon asking for re- 
medial legislation and complaining 
against certain law enfoir cement 
officers who, they claims are not as 
efficient as they should be. 

The delegation requested that in 
the provision of the tenancy act 
prohibiting the ousting of tenants 
by landowners except for just 
cause, the phrase “for just cause" 
be eliminated, thereby making it 
virtually Impossible for a landlord 
to eject a tenant. 

Among the charges made is that 
the tenancy law enforcement divi- 
sion of the department of labor is 
run by political lame ducks, young 
students and relatives of govern- 
ment officials. These men, the me- 
morandum stated, are incompetent 
and the .tenants’ rights are easily 
thwarted by smart lawyeis of 
landowners. The tenants want the 
division to be Reorganized and le- 
gislation passed defining precis^y_. 

' its pow’ers so That tenants -canhot' 

' be subjected to the double and^ 

• costly procedure of having to take 
. their claims both to the division 
and to the courts. r- 

It was explained that when a 
tenant brings his case to the divi- 
sion, the landowner files a suit in 
, court thereby forcing the tenant to 
J 'get his case tried ' before two 
courts. It is urged that all matters 
pertaining to agrarian disputes iru^ 

, volving tenants and landowners be 
submitted to the division. 

Fiscal Roman de Jesus was se- 
verely criticized in the memoran- 
dum. 

The tenants asked the President 
to set aside Pi, 500, 000 for the Far- j 
mers Financing cooperatives, to ( 
prevent the tenants from borrow- 
ing money from either their land- 
owners or from usurers, which 
usually, it is claimed, means the 
same thing. 

' President Quezon called Jose ; 
Abad Santos, secretary of justice, 
to the conference to get and study 
the points submitted by the ten- 
ants. The delegation was led by 
Juan Feleo, Guillermo Capadocia, 
Mateo del Castillo, Manuel Joven, 
Salvador Tiangco and Emilio 
Cruz. They represent tenants from 
the provinces of Tarlao, Pampan- 
ga and Nueva Ecija.

free Mominaftuwt» 

The influence of the Nacionalista Party ini ^ 
in the Philippines, the extent to which it re-| | 
presents the great majority of the people, need] ^ 
not be emphasized. Now', if the national con-* 
vention of the party, to assemble in Manila; ~ 
on August 16 for the purpose of nomhiating its! J 
candidates for the Congress, is to reaffirm tb,e 
party’s representation of the majority, it cam : 
do no better than to abide by the principles 
laid down yesterday by President Manuel Tj. 
Quezon, wdth respect to absolute equality . 
among the delegates, regardless of the official ; 
position any of them may Vinld In the t- r ; u-. 
ment. ‘ ^ 

It is a basic principle of true democi’acy \ 
that politics should never be permitted to jn- ^ 
terfere with the business of government. It: ; 
is an equally sound principle tha4: official po- 
sition in the government should under no cir- , 
cumstances be allowed to interfere with pol- 
itics, insofar as politics means the mechanics 
of popular selection of holders of public of- 
fice. . ' I 

The bureau director sitting as a party ' 
delegate in a convention may not bo forbidden 
by law to seek to influence another delegate 
who happens to be his subordinate in the bu- 
reau. But morally and ethically, he is just as 
much estopped from using his official position 
to impose his wall on a subordinate as say, a 
public school teachei\ by statute law% estopped 
from actively campaigning for a candidate. 

The essence of a real democracy, as Pres- 
ident Quezon has often declared, is free elec- 
tion. A nomination in a convention or in any 
other way is as much a part of an election 
as the casting of a ballot. There can be no 
really free elections without free nominations. 
Any attempt by any delegate or group of de- 
legates in a convention to use their official 
position as an instrument to marshal other de- 
legates is an attempt to prevent free nomina- 
tions. And wiien nominations are not free, 
freedom of elections becomes a fiction. 

When Manuel L. Quezon became President 
of the Commonwealth he declared that he. 
would be President of all the people, and to 
that extent he disassociated himself from ceiv 
tain phases of purely political activity. 

When the Nacionalista Party delegates 
meet in convention on Saturday, they should 
dissociate themselves, for the time of their ser- 
vice as delegates, from their governmental po- 
sitions insofar as those po.sitions might give 
them any ascendancy ovei’ theix’ fellow-deleg- 
ates, and thus assure a free convention, free., 
nominations, and a free election.

over the failure o£ the Cavite governm^^ 
pay the wages of nearly 200 laborers is 
: standable, and his action, candying a \varnm|^ 

; to the governor and the provincial board, 
i wholly praiseworthy, 

^ It is hard to undcrslaud me stale of offA' 

; dal mind which would, whatever the piovocar 
; tion, completely ignore the plight of men wha 
;had given good service for which they .wer^ 
, guaranteed a wage, and who, because; bf ^ 

, dispute in the upper reaches of officialdom! had 
*to wait for weeks for their paj^ — men to whom^ 
Uife in the best circumstances is a maUer.o:?' 

• living from hand to mouth. 

Because the governor and the proviiioial^^ 
•boai'd could not see eye to eye with the 6^^ 
Itrict engineer, some 200 men, whose sole sui)v 

• port was the scant wage which their labor 
earned for them, were forced to see their fam- ’ 
ilies suffer. 

It is important, as the President pointed 
out, that the government, which compels pri-^ . 
vate employers to pay their employes on time,; 
should be as rigorous with its own agencie^ 

But it is even more important that a gov- ' 
emment agency should never allow itself to. 
deprive its workers, particularly its low-paid 
workers, even for a single, day, of the wages 
on which they depend. 

The mei'itjs of, the dispute among the high 
officials of the province have nothing whah 
ever to do with the injustice which was per- i 
‘petrated when about 200 men and their fam- ^ 
ilies were' literally deprived of their livelihood' * 
for two months. 



Gratifying 



Assurance that the government of the Unit- 
ed States ■will exert every effort to extend to 
the Philippines such aid as they may require; 
both in the existing emergency and in working 
out a long-range solution of basic Philippine 
economic problems, is given by Henry F. 
Grady, in his dual capacity as a member of 
the Federal Loan Agency and as one of Amer- . 
lea’s key shipping executives. 

: The assurance that Mr. Grady gives is 

gratifying, not alone in its statement, but' in 
his warning that conditions will have to be 
met and certain problems overcome before 
specific aid can be made available. 

Mr. Grady does not question the capddty 
Of the Philippines to meet the conditions aixd 
to approach the problems. Nor does he in- 
dicate a suspicion that there may be disihelin-' 
ation here to consider Philippine needs without 
considering either conditions or problems. 

He simply • states a fact, giving us. both- 
.sides of the pictiu’e, and presenting the task 
before the Philippines in its major aspects. , 
^th the desire and the capacity to extend" 
lielp to the Commonwealth are present inC" 
Washington. The recognition of the difficuhj 
ties involved, and the capacity and the desire 
to overcome them, are present in Manila. . ^ 
; As for h's remarks concerning the n$ed(sj^ 
di the United States for Philippine producfi^fj 
and the hope that Philippine businessmen will 
cooperate to supply those -needs to the limit, 
of the country’s resources, we cannot doubt 
that the cooperation he seeks will be.- forthcorqt. 
ing in full measure.

ASSEMBLY SEAT 
CONTESTED BY 
FOUR PEOPLE 



Mitra, Gorospe, Jose, 
Pacis Mentioned 
Here 

Baguiu polil ics is beginning to ■ 
Avax liot as the Nov. 10 elections are : 
fast approadiiiig. Local party lead- : 
ers have started mending their 
fences by conducting whispering 
campaigns for their respective prob- 
able candidates. 

As- far as could be learned in 
Baguio tliis week, there are so far 
four probable candidates for repre- 
sentative in the next elections: ila- 
luon P. Mitra, incumbent assembly- 
man and head of the Nacioiialista 
party in the second district of 
Mountain Province**, Felipe E. Jose, 
former assemblyman and labor 
leader; Fernando Gorospe, a prac- 
tising attorney and proclaimed ofii- 
cial candidate of the United Nacio- 
nalista; and Pascual Pacis, an inde- 
pendent Nacionalista. 



Where Charity Begins 



T HE'*' indignation felt and expressed by President 
Quezon over the failure of the provinciaT govern- 
ment '8f' Cavite to -pay two months’ wages of 200 public 
works laborers is wholly characteristic, and was to be j 
expected the moment the matter was bro'a;~.ht to his j 
attention. . i 

President. Q^ez Oil Ki. '.^^UlCrAiCoS Kti .anger over isolated ^ 
and glaring cases of injustice has been demonstrated 
on, several memorable occasions. His threat to sus- 
pend the provincial board of Cavite unless it appro- 
priates the amount corresponding to the laborers’ wages 
at once is merely another proof of his keen sense of 
justice. His words were harsh and the remedy sought 
is harsher still, but the principle involved is of such 
importance that the President was well justified in 
brandishing the “big stick’’ the way he did. 

It is imfortunately true that the President cannot 
always have the time to examine instanefes of injustice 
in this manner. He is only bne man, while the men 
and women who fall victims to one form or another 
of unfair practices of the mox’e powerful are legion. 
Yet it is sxifficient that cases of this nature be brought 
occasionally to his personal attention to convince him 
that there are many more things that yet remain to 
be done before the poor and- the humble of this land 
nre fully safeguarded in the enjoyment of their demo- 
cratic rights and privileges. 

It is absurd, the President angrily declared yes- 
terday, to enjoin private firms to practice the prin- 
ciples of social justice towards their workers so long 
as the government itself does not observe those prin- 
ciples in the treatment of its own employees. Well 
said; yet, the question of gi^dng justice to every man 
is not a matter of example merely; it is a matter of 
duty devolving upon public and private enterprise 
equally — without distinction. 



Another x^^’^bable candidate is 
•Miss Virginia Oteyza, Baguio’s pop- 
ulaT iady councilor. It was ga- 
tliered in political quarters here 
that Miss Oteyza may throw her hat 
into the political arena at the in- 
sistence pf labor elements who are 
urging her to run. When Miss Otey- 
za was asked by the Bulletin on I 
whether she would be a candidate, * 
she replied, she would rather not ’ 
say anything about it. 

Who wdll be the otiicial Naciona- 
'lista candidate for the Baguio and 
second district for Mountain Prov- 
ince has not as yet been proclaimed., 
It was, IiOAvever, held for sure that 
Assemblyman Mitra, a member of 
the Naciolista directorate, may be 
declared official candidate. 



In a communication sent to the 
President by Fernando Gorospe, pro- j 
claimed candidate of the United | 
Nacionalista, a party opposed to i 
that of Assemblyman Mitra, ho and 
other members of his party, Isidro 
Siapno, Antonio Rimando and Al- 
fredo Disini, petitioned the Presi- 
dent to declare the second district 
as a free zone. Copies of the peti- 
tion were sent to Speaker Jose Yulo, 
Floor Leader Quintin Paredes and 
members of the Nacionalista party 
directorate. 



The petition claims that the can- 
didates for representative in the 
coming elections are all loyal fol- 
lowers of the Nacionalista party; 
that all Nacionalista factions who 
opposed Assemblyman Mitra in the 
last elections jointly oppose the 
election of the incumbent assembly- 
man; that Assemblyman Mitra does 
not represent the majority of the 
electorate in the district; that As- 
semblyman Mitra has antagonized 
labor Avith the introduction of two 
bills, one vetoed by the President 
and another defeated in the Na-

Recently Felipe Jose, former as-

nounced his decision to appeal to 
the Nacionalista party headquarters 
for a decision making him the offi- 
cial party candidate here. He pub- 
lished a letter from Dr. 1\ C. A.r- 
j visu, city councilman, in w-hich 
the latter denied that he was a can- 
didate for office. Dr. Arvisu"^ later 
stated that he does not belong to any 
faction of the party, as has been al- 
leged. As an appointee of President 
Q uezo^ ^ he will abide by party deci- 
sions, he said. 

Meanwhile Pedro Tawas, well- 
known native miner, protested the 
result of the recent United Nacio-

irregularities in the method of bal- 
loting for official candidates in 
which Fernando Gorospe, practising 
attorney, Avas selected over Ciriaco 
Lopez, former justice of the peace, 
by a majority of three votes.

GRACIAS AL PRESIDENTE 



E l Presidente Quezon ha aclvertido aj'er al gobernador 
y miembros de la junta provincial de Cavite que seran 
destituidos sumariamente de sus cargos, si no aprueban 
cuaiito antes los fondos necesarios para pagar a los dos- 
cientos trabaj adores de obras publicas que no han cobrado 
j.js salaries desde el 16 de junio ultimo hasta la fecha. 



No se comprende como pueden ocurrir estas cosas 
eiiteramente anomalas e inhumanas que ceden en dano de 
los obreros que viven al dia, o que no pueden ahorrar ni 
medio centime de sus jornales para salvar sus necesidades 
cotidianas con lo poco que ganan. 



Porque es inhumano dejar pasar dias y mas dias antes 
de que el pobre hombre de calzon corto pueda cobrar lo 
que necesita para dar de cower a su familia, o a los mhos 
que van a la escuela. Los infelices de esa dase, mientras 
)io reciben sus miseros joi !es, tienen que entregarse 
inevitablemente a manos del usurero sin entranas para 
poder ir tirando mientras esperan el santo adveniniiento. 
Tienen que vivir del prestamo o a credito, y ya se sabe que 
lo que se compra a credito siempre es mas caro, especial- 
raente en estos dias de crisis. 



Esta es una razon por que el ladvon de usurero, el ex- 
plotador sin alma de Jos necesitados, halla siempre un 
canipo muy abonado en nuestro pais, porque hasta nuestro 
gobierno, inconscientemente, se pone a veces en complici-- 
dad por su desidia, con esos chupadores de la sangre de 
sus seme j antes que deberian estar ardiendo vivos en el 
Memo de los condenados de que nos habla la Doctrina 
Cristiana. 



Gracias a esa energica advertencia del Presidente de 
Jilipinas, esos desgraciados obreros que han tenido pa- 
ciencia de esperar mas de dos meses pai’a tener algiin 
dinero propio en sus bolsillos, cobraran dentro de poco sus 
iornales atrasados, y .es razonable suponer que todo lo que 
cobren se ira inmediatamente en pagos de las deudas 
tontraidas, mientras no cobraban, para que ellos y sus 
uinos puedan vivir. 



De ser posible, la ley deberia establecer que el pago 
de los salaries de los obreros debe ser preferente, porque 
estos no tienen reserva en ningun banco de que echar 
mano cuando se ven obligados por la desidia de una junta 
pro\incial a vivir apuradamente, cosa que no ocurre con 
los que tienen buenos sueldos fijos y ahorros en un banco. 



Una demora de una semana o diez dias, todavia puede 
.e.xplicarse por algiin motivo justificado o imprevisto, pero 
dos meses para el desdichado que gana un peso diario o 
Menos, cuando trabaj a, y cuando no traba.ia no recibe nacla, 
es crueldad,. no a los animales- irracionales, como los caba- 
llos, sino a los hombres creados por Dios a su imager, y 
semejanza.

Malaysian Fete Committee Told 




TO SUBMIT BILL 
I ON PJ. DEFENSE 



$50,000,000 Would Build 
Pill Boxes, Forts 
Across Luzon 



WASHINGTON, Aug. 27 (UP).— 
The adininistratiou will submit a 
fotmal request for approximately • 
$50,000,000 for Philippine defense 
projects soon after the house 
reconvenes Sept. 15, the United 
Press learned today. 

It was understood the army and 
navy general staffs have completed 
work on a lon^ list of defense in- 



‘ stallations for* the Islands which 
when completed will give the Philip- 
pines the strongest possible defense , 
establishment. 

The defense installations are 
expected to be made on four feasible 
routes across the island of ^Luzon 
and will include machine gun pill 
boxes, gun emplacements, forts, 
airfields and antiaircraft nests. 

Informants said the new projects 
would not include the cost of air- 
craft or ordnance which would be 
charged to regular army depart- 
' ments. 

An exchange of telegrams between 
President Eoosevelt and Presideut 
jVJLaiiUQi ^-*1 Qu^ou jjrovided the 
; basis f oT " an agreement between 
U. S. and Commonwealth officials 
on terms for the appropriation 
. which would be asked of congress, 

• it was learned. 

The money will be provided from 
sugar processing tax refunds and 
repayment of the loss to the Com- 
mon^^"ealtU government when the 
United States devalued the dollar. ; 

It was understood the appropria- 1 
tidn will be initialed by the interior 1 
department and other executive ^ 
^departments but now may be awali*' 
ing clearance on minor points.

Carmen Pianos Gives Up 
Cify for National Politics 



To City Hall, nerve^center of 
Manila’s political life. Carmen 
Planas said goodbye yesterday, 
goodbye to stormy city council 
sessions, panhandlers and job- 
seekers, the long walk from her 
room to the session hall. She 
-was going into the big-time and 
City Hall was her springboard. 

First elected to the city coun- 
cil in 1937, Miss Planas was re- 
turned in 1940, polling a record 
80,000 votes. For a novice at po- 
litics, her showing was unprec- 
edented, probably will never be 
equalled in many, many years. 

When Miss Planas filed her 
candidacy for the house of re- 
presentatives last night, she clos- 
ed a chapter of a spectacular 
political career to open another. 
To be a candidate she had to 
give up her seat in the council, 
with practically two-thirds of her 
term un expired. 

No other councilor made the 
headlines oftener or in larger 
types than did Carmen Planas 
during the three years, seven 
months, 27 days that she was at 
City Hall. She was the first wo- 
man to sit in the city council. 

In 1938 Miss Planas made news 
when she was ordered investigat- 
ed by Pr esident Q uezon for crit- 
icizing the conduct of that year’s 
election for the National Assem- 
bly. The investigation dragged 
for months, and even after it 
was over it kept popping up at 
political meetings, oratorical con- 
tests, city council sessions. 

During the 1937-40 term Mis.s 
Planas had to make the most of 
her being in the minoritj^. She 
sponsored a ^ few ill-fated ordin- 
ances, ir^any resolutions, more 
motions, at times monopolizing 
the days 'calendar. In 1939 she 
agitated for a ladie.s’ rest room 
for City Hall employes. Mis? Pla- 
r^as never got it. 



CARMEN PLANAS 



In this connection, Misp Be- 
nitez has suggested that modi- 
fications of Malaysian styles will 
be in order, as no one will bo 
expected to sacrifice effect for 
the sake of authenticity. 

The other committees are as 
follows: Mrs. Minerva Iiaudico. 

and Miss Lourdes Ledesma, fin- 
ance; Misses Bay Syquia, and Ju- 
lita Ledesma, refreshments; Miss- 
es Inday Lacson, and Nina Estra-; 
da, program and entertainment; 
Misses Lulu Reyes, Amparito Na- 
tividad and Lily de las Alas, tic- 
kets and distribution; Misses Ma- 
ria Aurora Quezon and Conebing* 
Sunico, bar; Misses Josef a Alu- 
nan, and Betty Magalona, assist- 
ed by Mesdames Susan M. Ledes- 
ma, Lucv P- Casanova and Ama- 
da L. Eraha, games.

President, accompanied by his 
aides, motored to the Cavite naval 
yard, where he was received with 
due honors. Upon arrival, a salute 
of 19 guns was fired. A review 
Was also held in his honor. The

cuales abogaba ol Presidente

en cuanto a productos del coco 
son tan grandes que se puede 
considerar como el factor nias

Filipinas tiene todas las facili-

como para ganar domiiuo de su

El yute necesita ser sembra- 
db, cosbehado, enriado, desfibra-

no hay razon por que los 300,000

P. I. Man Power And Democracy Pass 
lest 4s 20,00(1 Mobilize For Service 



Yesterday, in the 14 hours be- 
tween 7 a. m. and 9 p. ni., the Phil- 
ippines put its man power and 
democracy to a test. Both passed 
with honors. Some 20,000 free men, 
aged 21 to 26, did what they had 
been told to do: report to mobiliza- 
tion centers.

Cebu National Park 
Created By Proclamation 



President Manuel L. Quezon to^ 
day signed aT^pPrrriaTO a t t bh^ reserv. 
3j g more than 15,000 hectares of 
public forest-covered land in the ! 
municipalities of Balamban and 
Toledo, and the city of Cebu, Cebu, 
for park purposes. The park is to 
be known as the Central National 
Park. It shall remain under the 
administration of the bureau of 
forestry. 

The park is practically the only 
forested portion of the entire is- 
land of Cebu, the greater portion 
of the province being denuded of ‘ 
vegetation. One of the main pur- 
poses in setting aside this region 
as a national park is to prevent 
waricon destruction . of trees, thus 
allowing remaining trees to grow 
unmolested by the hands of men*

Ready for the People’s Verdict 

T he.- filing of the papers of candidacy for Pji^si^nt 
Quezon and -Vice-President Osmena yesterday com- 
nlet^'THT formal requirements of the procedure by 
which the merits of this leadership shall once again be 
presented for approval by the whole nation m Novern- 

ber. 

It is fitting that the party and not the candidates 
themselves should file these papers, for, as President 
Quezon announced long ago and repeated at the time 
of the Nationalist party convention, he is not a candi- 
date for re-election by his personal ’.vill choice, nor 
will he campaign for votes. If, in spite of this, he shall 
be elected by the people, then he will have to serve, iot 
it is not seemly that any man should run away from 
a mandate of the people. 

Accordingly, the papers have been accomplished 
and filed for him and his worthy team-mate in the 

NationaL^^ presidential ticket. The Qu^ 

Osmena leadership is once more to be weighed m th„ 
balance of, the popular mind. Nothing is »iore certain 
than that when election day comes around,, the verdict 
of a wise and grateful people shall be ovenvhelmmoly 
in favor of a vSte .of confidence for this leadership.

SPMT OK FUSION? — ^This was the topic of an mtimate all-mornhig 
conversation in Malacahan today between President Quezon, left^ and 



Vice-President Osmefia, right, 

' M 



Quezon Forbids 
Use of Puli 

Irked by the practice of some ; 
government employees of soli- 
citing the intervention of sup- 
posedly influential persons to 
work for their promotions or 
salary increases, President .Ma- 
fnuel L. Quezon yesterday is- 
fsued an administrative order 
-enjoining strict compliance with 
a civil service rule which con- 
siders recommendations from 
; unauthorized persons as “un- 
warrantable interference with 
the public service. “ 



Under this rule, no .lecoiiunend- 
ation can be considered by the 
corresponding officials unless it 
comes from the superior officer 
of the employee concerned. It 

, also provides that employees who 
solicit the recommendation of 

third persons shall be debarred 
’ from the promotion proposed, 

( and a repetition of the offense 
Wvill be considered sufficient 
cause for removal from office. 



The President expressed him-; 
' Self stiongly agaipst “pull,” say- 
ing that such practice is repug- 
nant to the merit principle upon 
I which the civil service ^ules are 
! based, as promotion in the ser- 
. vice depends primarily on de- 
monstrated efficiency. 

The civil service rule cited by 
^ the President in his adminis- 
trative order rcad.s: 

“No recommendation of any 



person for promotion, whether 
verbal or in writing, shall te 
received or considered unless it 
be made by the officer or of- 
ficers under whose supervision 
he is or has been employed, and 
the presentation of any other 
recommendation shall be consid- 
ered an unwarrantable inter- 
ferance with the public service; 
and such a recommendation 
made at the solicitation or with 
the knowledge or consent of the 
employee shall be sufficient 
cause for debarring him from 
the promotion proposed, and a. 
repetition of the offense shall he 
sufficient cause for removing 
him from the service,*'

pRESlDENT <<|;ue*oji’s request that the plan to hold 
a nation-wide day of prayer for his recovery be 
discontinued and that the people’s prayers instead be 
'expressed more in the privacy of homes and church- 
es IS thoroughly in keeping with true Christian prac- 
tice. ^ 

^ere is not the slightest hint of even a mild re- 
proof in the letter, and we are certain that the Pres- 
ident intended to convey no such thing to the commit- 
tee which had already been formed to, take charge of 
national prayer demonstration. As the object of 
the demonstration, the President merely indicated a 
p^ierence, and everybody will agree that this express- 
ed preference is much more dignified and in better 
taate. 

The entire nation wishes to see President Quezon 
recover jpeedily and is greatly encouraged to hear him 
a^irm tnat he is almost completely well. The people’s 
uu.yersai prayer is ttet his health will continue to Im- 
o rder that he may be in . a condition to meet

Quarters for the officers in Ba-

post. No facilities or accommoda-

The training period will be inten-

4:00 p'.m. Outdoor exercises will 
be undertaken from 4:00 to 5:00

%GES SALE OF 



On Profiteering 

The Emergency Control Administration yesterday started to 
strengthen its machinery for the enforcement of the anti-pro- 
fiteering order" issued by President Quezon under the Emer- 
gency Powers Act and to resume its campaign against pro- 
fiteering, hoarding and various forms of trade manipulations. 



The appointm^t of at least "ll 
special ' agents with powers to 
carry out all instructions and or- 
ders of the KCA is under advise- 
ment. A recommendation to this 
effect has been referred to Ma- 
lacahan. 

Meanwhile, the EGA will today 
or tomorrow start the distribu- 
tion of the revised price schedule 
w’^hich President Quezon has ap- 
proved together wdth the anti- 
profiteering order. Copies will be 
distributed throughout the coun- 
try, advertised and conspicuous- 
ly posted on public places for the* 
information of all concerned. 

Pi'ovincial committees are com- 
posed of the governor, the prov- 
incial treasurer and the district 
engineer. These provincial com- 
mittees will have powers and su- 
pervisions over all the municipal 
sub-committees in their respec- 
tive provinces. 

To supplement the order on 
Tra^i-profiteering, the EGA will 
B^rtly recommend to the Pres- 

‘ -.oxiriiiv 



ident the promulgation or 
al other orders on hoarding, and 
other forms 6f violations. 

Meanwhile, the trial of Cua 
Lian, a Chinese businessman ac- 
cused of profiteering, will be held 
this morning before Judge Bue- 
naventura Ocampo of the Manila 
court of first insfance, who hah 
denied a motion that trial of the 
profiteering case be held in abey- 
ance until after the supreme 
court had decided the appeal of 
Assistant Fiscal Agustin P. Mon- 
tesa from the ruling of Judge 
Jose R. Carlos that no law exists 
•which punishes profiteering. 

The filing of additional profit- 
eering casqs with Fiscal Monte- 
sa hajs slackened lately, due, it is 
believed, to the fact that Dl-men 
and agents of the EGA are wah- 
i ing for the issuance of the r^vis- 
■ ed price schedule under the new 
executive order on price-fixing. 



GOVT. PAPERS 

President Manuel L. Quezon 
' last night issued an executive or-

general public for sale at such 
prices as may be fixed therefor

istrative Code.”

Quezon Issues 
Order On New 
P. /. Airports 



^ Quezon today issued 

an executive order establishing 
new airports and landing fields and 
classifying those already in exist- 
ence, He issued the order upon 
the recommendation of the Nation- 
al Transportation board. 

The order established the follow- 
ing classification of airports and 
landing fields: 1. National airports 
and landing fields; 2. National 
emei'gency landing fields; 3. Pro-, 
vincial airports and landing fields, 

4:, City airports and landing fields; 

’ .Municipal airports and landing 
fields; 6. Private airports; and 7. 
U* S. military airports and land- 
ing fields. 

In making the above classifica- 
tion the President specified what 
lauding fields and airports are to 
be placed 'under each. The rea-^ 
son for the classification is to bet-| 
ter fix the responsibility for their 
proper construction and mainten- i 

Secretary Jorge' said

Not for Party Unity 

No better reply to the charge that he is 
dabbling in sectional politics could be made 
by hlanuel Xi, Quezon than in his 

speech in Naga, when he counselled his hear- 
ers to vote in the coming elections for the can- 
didate they regarded as the best man, and 
when he promised them that their choice will 
receive the full cooperation and support of his 
administration. 



This is the only answer that could be given 
by the President of the Commonwealth, both 
to the charge of playing politics that has been 
leveled against him, and to the clamor for 
“party unity” which has been raised in the ef- 
fort to handpick candidates and to regiment 
the majority party’s- voting strength behind 
the .selected aspirants. 

Party unity is necessary to the party ma- 
chine, to keep the mechanism working and 
to make possible smooth and unbroken appli- 
cation of political control. It is not essential 
to that greater unity — the unity of the nation 
—which can never be regimented, which can 
only come through popular conviction that in- 
dividual rights are sacred, and that individual 
opinion and its expression have full and free 
play. 



It is the duty of the President of the Com- 
monwealth to maintain the unity of the peo- 
ple. To this end he must command the re- 
spect, the confidence of the people. It is not 
his job to work for the unity or the prosperity 
of any single party. ^ 

President. Quezon is retaining the loyalty 
and the confidence of the people, both by 
working tor the interests of all the people! 
and by refusing to be involved in the strug- 
factions of the Nacionalista 
Af ^ ^^portant^and only to the interests 

or the several factions.

10 o'clock in the morning. Secre- 
tary Avelino flCw back to Manila 
from Iloilo this morning. While 
in Iloilo, he was unable to meet 
President Quezon, who is due back 
on Sunday. 

Secretary Vargas released a let- 
ter received from Bishop Santiago 
Fonacier of the Aglipayan church 
in repiy to one sent to him by 
Pr esMent Quezon. In the letter 
Bishop Fonacier pledged the co- 
operation of his church to the 
Commonwealth . 



Defiance? 

Over a fortnight ago, President Ma- 
nuel L. Quezon ordered the opening 
of the public streams' in Pampanga, 
which were converted into private 
Kshponds by owners of the land ad- 
jacent to such streams. Accordingly, 
the government proceeded to remove 
the obstructions, in the form of dams, 
some of which were blamed for the 
recent flood in the province. Latest 
reports from Pampanga say that a 
number of fishpond owners have de- 
fied the Pre.sident^s order by rer)lacing 
the removed obstructions.

Reelection Of Quezon 
Indispensable To U. S. 
Pro-Democracy Policy 

Washington Circles Consider Philippine President 
Spokesman Of Malayan Peoples; Manila Nacio- 
nalisfas United Behind Quezon-Osmena Team 



By JTJtroS C. EDELSTEIN 

United Press Staff Corresvondent 

WASHINGTON, Nov. 3. — Capitol newspapers are displaying In- 
terest in the forthcoming PhiUppine election and they generaUy 
forecast the reelection of President Manuel L,. Quezon and Vice- 
President Sergio Osmena. 



]WTiile a few officials associated/^- 
with Philippine affairs commented-) 
somewhat cynically that the Phil- | 
Ippines had a virtually one-party 
system and stressed the desirabil- 
ity of a more active opposition 
party, most impartial quarters 
agreed that the Philippine nation- 
al election, in the midst of the 
Far Eastern turmoil, was a heaTTIiy 
symbol of democracy in the Axis- 
menaced Orient. 

Official and unofficial circles 
agreed unanimously that President 
Quezon’s reelection was as indis- 
pensable to the United States’ poh 
icy as was Mr. Roosevelt’s reelec- 
tion a year ago. 

They said it was unwise to risk 
a shift in the administration of 
the Commonwealth at the present 
time when all energies must be 



conserved in the interest of na- ' 
tlonal self-preservation and de- 
fense. 

Quezon’s supporters said he w^as 
not only best acquainted with the 
administrative problems of the 
Philippines, but had international 
views which are , known and re- 
cognized throughout the world, 
making him an ideal spokesmah 
for the Filipino people during the 
current Avar period. 

They said Quezon has already^ 
established his diplomatic skiU.'^ 
which has made 'him the virtual j 
United States diplomatic represent- j 
ative among the Malayan, peoples. !

Tile Verdict Of History 

TN^REVIOUS celebrations of the anniversary of the 

Commonwealth, it has been customary to empha- 
size ^16 social and economic gains which have accrued 
to the people under the leadership of President Que- 
zon. Last Saturday, it seemed highly appropriate that 
the President himself, in. the course of a speech reite- 
rating Filipino I<^alty te America, s'aoui3^ Tiave 
^rg§§gd tuat aspect or tHe national effort in which his 
administration has been most signally successful; 
namely, the pl.vining and execution of the national 
defense program. 

With justifiable pride. President Quezon could 
point to the fact that the present impressive defense 
set-up of the Philippines is owing largely to the vision ; 
and enterprise which enabled him to push through a 
program of national military preparedness despite the 
skepticism of “experts” and the opposition of “liberals” 
here and in the United States. Today he has the satis- 
faction of seeing the wisdom of his defense policy con- 
firmed in every respect by the imperative realities of 
the present-day world. 

Against the “expert” testimony of people who 
declared that the Philippines is indefensible. President 
Quezon proceeded resolutely to set aside funds for na- 
tional defense and to train soldiers for the Philippine 
Army. Charged with establishing an army to suppress 
freedom and to help maintain himself as dictator, he 
went ahead, secure in the conviction that the indepen- 
dent of the Filipino people must someday be defended 
by Fihpmo arms against the threat of aggression. 

President Quezon can point with pardon- 
able satisfaction; first, to the fact that America’s deci- 
sion to defend the Philippines has been inspired mainly 
by the determination of the Filipino people to defend 
themselves; and second, to the fact that an army 
which hostile critics feared might someday be used to 
suppress freedom is today being prepared to defend 
freedom. 

Is it gilding the lily to say that in this, as in 
various other matters hardly less important, history 
has once again given its verdict in favor of the Que- 
zon leadership? Yet the reminder is important, not so 
much as proof of the wisdom oi this leadership in the 
past, but rather as /comforting assurance that its poli- 
cies and decisions in the perilous and uncertain future 
shall be marked by a wisdom equally unerring. The 
same foresight born, of reason and experience and the 
same persistence born of truth and courage shall con- 
tinue to be placed in the service of the nation. 

But for this foresight and this persistence of Pre- 
sident Quezon in pursuing his original program of na- | 
tional defense, this impressive phenomenon of complete ■' 
Filipino-American collaboration in defense, of absolute 
Filipino loyalty to America would be a futile and mean- j 
mgless gesture. The United States might have thought ' 
it useless and unwise to undertake the active defense > 
of the Archipelago against attack by a first-class power, 
and the United States Army Forces in the Far East 
might never have been organized at all. 

But because President Quezon was firmly per- 
suaded that the Filipino people must forge a weapon i 
for their own defense — and not a token force merely | 
but an army capable of repelling invasion — he has to- 
day the immense satisfaction of seeing that the sover- 
eign power has declared itself willing to defend the 
Philippines as thoroughly and as effectively “as any 
state of the Union.” 

And so, today, we can speak of Filipino loyalty 
to America, of Filipino determination to fight side by 
side with the American nation with full knowledge that 
this loyalty and determination shall have concrete de- 
monstration in action when and as the need for such 
action may arise. The great American battle for de- 
mocracy shall become our battle too in the truest sense 
of the word, and we shall be able to say, fighting back- 
to-l>ack .with' the American people, that their ideals 
as’e i^fei,too — to bleed for and' to die. 












Leadership 
In Congress 
Faces Test 



State of Emergency 
Factor to Keep 
Hormony Intact 



By ViefiNTE J. GUZMAN 
Of the Tribune Staff 

strong congressional lead- 
ership will be needed in the 
future to preserve the harmony 
that has existed between the 
administration and the legislat- 
ive department, according to 
the belief in political circles. 

These quarters see no likeli- 
hood that President Manuel L. 
Quezon will lose the coopera- 
tion of the legislature, but they 
see several factors pressaging 
a spirit of insurgence in the 
legislative department. One 
circumstance, however, favors/ 
the preservation of the clo;^ 
harmony that has been main- 
tained between these two de- 
partments. 

The factor is the national em- 
ergency. The state of national 
emergency is an -insurance 
against any quarrel of^ Congress 
with the administration. 

It is not likely, it was said, 
that the President will have dif- 
ficulty in pushing through em- 
ergency legislation for many of 
the newly elected members of 
Congress, realizing the gravity 
Of the situation, haye expressed 
themselves in favor of coopera- 
tion to help in meeting it. 

But this will probably last 
only as long as the emergency, 
many believe. The conditions 
created by the revival of a bic- 
ameral legislature and the tem- 
perament of the men elected to 
the Congress are rich with any 
number of possibilities, in the 
opinion of many. 

Observers do not go so far as 
to predict an open break in the 
future, but they hold that leg- 
islation will not be as easily ob- 
tained as it has been in the past. i 

To keep Congress in , line and . 
to maintain the harmony that - 
has existed between the two 
branches of the national gov- 
ernment, a strong leadership, is 
obviously needed, according to 
observers. 

the first place, unlike In 
its first six yearii,. the aviminis- 
tration has to uonieiid now with 
a bicameral legislature, the con- 
trol of which, as shown by, past 
experience, would naturally have 
to challenge the political ability 
of the national leaders. 

A more important factor than 
that. however, is the human 
equation. Although both houses 
;ire predominantly Nacloualista, 
only tlDiee opposition men having 
been elected, a study of the. pol-

UicaJ back^»^i uund ui‘ nia ny 'of tiu* 
men in Congress has led observ- 
ei’S to believe that they will not 
be easily led. 

Yet another consideration is the 
apparent attempt of a certain 
group to show its influence, if 
not to control not only the sen- 
ate but also the house. So far 
the move of this group remains 
unchecked and Is said to be 
a out ready to upset preconceiv- 
G plans involving the congros- 
siomtl ieadei’ship. 

The situation created ha.^ al- 
ready manifested itself in the 
preliminary organization plans 
for both houses, political qmirt- 
, ers believe. Unless administra- 
tion leaders step in and with 
determination, these moves may 
^ hinder an immediate . organiza,- 
tion of Congress, especially tlje 
senate, whex'e the moves of the 
Roxas-Recto combine are being 
carefully watched. 

In this connection, political 
.observers thought that his desire ‘ 
to pave the way for a speedy or- 
ganization of the senate prompt- 
ed Floor Leader Quin tin Pare- 
des to renounce the senate floor 
leadership, Paredes said in a 
pi ess statement that he . is direct- 
ing- his efforts to “facilitating 
^'a harmonious organization*' of 
both houses. 

I The Roxas-Recto combination 
' is reported to claim a following 
of 11 senafors-elect, which is 
four short of the number to en- 
able it to elect the senate pres- 
ident and the floor leader and 
to gain control of the upper 
chamber. 

These claims are laughed at 
by the Yulo-Paredes group, 
which, it w’as said, a suf- 

ficient following to capture the 
senate leadership. It is known, 
however, that any winning com- 
bination in the senate will gain 
control of the lower house and, 
consequently, of Congress. This 
is obvious because the senate, 
despite constitutional restric- 
tions, is bound to exercise the 
leadersliip in Congress because 
of the caliber of the men In 
I the upper chamber. 

,! The house of representatives, 

* although predominantly compos- 
ed of conseiwative element.s, 
finds itself with a small but voc- 
iferous group of independent- 
minded congressmen. Besides, 
no clear-cut policy has yet been 
established with respect to the 
nine Nacionalista rebels, includ- 
ing the three who won in spe- 
cial provinces. 

It would be to the advantage 
of national leaders to take thesu 
nine congressmen into their '•cir- 
cle for unless this is done they 
might join forces with the three 
opposition representatives. Pro- 
perly led, these 1? might wield 
nn influence .of, no mean propor-

Quezon Tells Hawaii Filipinos To 
Fight Side By Side With America 



President Quezon drew tiie Pili- 
pinos in Hawaii into a side-by-side 
stand with America in a two-way 
radio broadcast ycsterdn^y after- 
noon^ a post-script to the ’sixth an- 
niersary of the inauguration of the 
Commonwealth . 

The program originated from 
Honolulu, sponsored by the Filipino 
community there, and a return 
broadcast was made over KZRM in 
Manila, which carried the speech 
of President Quezon from the Mala- 
cahan Guest House over the Col- 
umbia Broadcasting system to 
Hawaii. 

A salient part of the President’s 
speech •was that portion wherein he 
declared the Philippines owes the 
United States a debt of gratitude 
that knows no bounds and that 
*'we are determined to fight^for her 
and, if necessary, to lay down our 
lives so thah the ideals and prin- 
ciples for w’hich she stands shall 
not perish from the earth.” 

He said he was confident that the 
Filipinos shared the sentiments of

lippines, He entered upon his se-

their countrymen in the Philippines 
as he had voiced them in his re- 
peated pledges of loyalty to and 
support of the United .States -in' 
case of \far, adding, /a am coii- 
fideut that if and when words have 
to be translated into deeds, not a 
single one among us will be found 
lagging behindJ.’ ' 

President Quezon thanked Hawaii 
residents for their expressions of 
loyalty and support of his adminis- 
tration and for their congratula- 
tions on his reelection. He said the', 
people back home are proud of the ' 
Hawaii Filipinos because they have 
made good, improved their lot and 
sent home their savings which have 
been invested in productive enter- 
prises.

Allan A, Michie as their guest

almost become a commonplace

personally experienced during 
eighteen months in London, but 
he gave liis audience a ringside

■pjE todos es sabido que en la vida social son grandes e 

irreparables los danos que producen la murmura- 
cion, la calumnia, la falsedad, las verdades a medias, la 
mentira, en una palabra. 

For esto, una personalidad ilustre y respetada de 
nuestros tiempos ha afirmado que la campana de false- 
dades que se ha iniciado casi al romperse las hostilida- 
des del actual conflicto, produce mayores danos y mas 
irreparables que los que causan los bombardeos de la 
artillena y la aviacion. 

Los efectos de una mentira, de una verdad dicha 
a medias, perduran anos y anos, y aun siglos, hasta que 
aparecen hombres sinceramente amantes de la verdad 
que, tras laboriosa y paciente investigacion, logran des- 
cubrirla y exponerla, aunque, desgraciadamente, tarda 
la verdad asi expuesta en abrirse paso en la inteligen- 
cia y la voluntad de las gentes. Se podrian citar como 
ejemplo, ciertas supuestas historias fundadas en false- 
dades y calumnias o medias verdades que justamente 
se han denominado leyendas negras. 

Casi todos los pueblos han padecido alguna vez de 
esta ofensiva de la mentira, pero no hay duda de que 
es en nuestros tiempos cuando la campana es mas ex- 
tensa y amplia, y hasta puede decirse que ha perfec- 
cionado su tecnica, como consecuencia de los adelantos 
singulares puestos al servicio de la mas rapida difusion 
de las informaciones y mult'iplicacion de los impresos, 
por lo que es mas eficaz, es decir, mas danosa. 

En nuestras relaciones con los Estados Unidos, se 
ha interpuesto con mucha frencuenia esta ofensiva de 
mentiras o falsas representaciones, encaminada a obs> 
curecer la situacion de las Islas y los verdaderos senti- 
mientos de nuestros caudillos y de nuestro pueblo ante 
la opinion del pueblo norteamericano. Uno de los casos 
recientes es el que ha sido energicamente denunciado y 
combatido por el Presidente Quezon en su discurso ul- 
timo, que reyelo con toda claridad quienes fueron los 
autores de los juicios temerarios y las falsas represen- 
taciones que ocultaron ante la opinion norteamericana 
los verdaderos propositos en que se inspiro la peticion 
de poderes extraordinarios para el Presidente, y cuales 
fueron los efectos de aquella actitud. 

Pero, no obstante esta denuncia y tomando pie 
precisamente de ella, los habituados a la malicia con- 
tindan en su maligna actitud y han trasmitido a Esta- 
dos Unidos el discurso del Presidente, pero en tal forma 
que se da a entender cosa distinta de la que realmente 
dijo, por lo que se ha visto obligado a dar a publicidad 
una declaracion que, no hay duda, que la ratificamos 
todos los filipinos que sabemos cual es nuestro deber 
en el momento actual. 

Con el Presidente Quezon bien puede afirmar cada 
ciudadano de Filipinas que el Presidente Roosevelt, al 
igual que el pueblo norteamericano, pueden contar con 
el hasta el fin, sea este cual fuere, y aunque ello re- 
quiriese el. mayor sacrificio. 

Esta es la unica actitud factible en contra de la 
maliciosa y dahina campana de quienes persisten en va- 
lerse de todos los medios que tienen a su alcance, menos 
del unico legitimo: la verdad. 



President, Comr. Sayre , 
Lead Early Influx - C 
Of Visitors ; 

liCfl by Prosideut Manuel Quezon ’ 
and High Commissioner irrancis B,- 
Sayre, many visitors have already ^ 
arrived for tlie Christmas season, ' 
and despite Par Eastern tension, or 
perhaps because of it, the season 
has begun days earlier than normal. ' 

President Quezon arrived Thurs- . 
day morning for a rest at liis oVjx . 
home near Burnham Park, and the . 
High Commissioner was expected to 
arrive Thursday or Priday. Mrs. 
Sajnro preceded him bj’- several days. 

Konnon road traffic in November • 
showed a considerable increase over 
that of 1940, reversing a trend which 
had been noticed during the rainy 
season. ^ 

Many persons who usually travel 
abroad have been unable to do so 
this year, and as a result are break- 
ing up their vacation into occasional 
trips to Baguio. Instead of staying 
for a week-end, they remain here 
two or three weeks. Likewise, those ' 
who own houses hero have kept them 
open since the ^nd of the rainy 
season, with husbands working in the 
lowlands and coming up to see their 
families on week-ends. 

Homeowners from Manila and the 
Visayas are coming to realize that 
Baguio is a far safer place than 
some cities in the Rowlands in the 
event of war, and many of them are'* 
planning to keep their Baguio resi- ' 
deuces open for several months 
instead of going back after New. 
Yearns. ; 

Also, there is a steadily growing 
realization that Baguio is at its best- 
at this time of the year. Improved 
communications, which have made 
the trip up from Manila a very 
comfortable ride lasting a matter of 
minutes by plane or a few hours by 
car or railroad, have helped in the 
early season opening. 

Bagrxio’s stores are now stocked 
for Christinas shopping, and many, 
of them offer a surprisingly fine 
collection of* goods at reasonable 
prices. Shopping trips to Manila are 
almost unnecessary nowadays.

rapan. Lubusang nauunawaan 
ng pangulong Roosevelt ang ka- 
lagayan dito at pinuri niya ang 
kahangahangang katapangan ng 
ating mga kawal. Nagtitiwala 
. ako na gagawin ng Estados Unh 
dos ang lahat nang magagawa 
up^ng tulungan tayo sa pagdirig- 
maa.n sa larangang ito. 

‘"Ang ilan sa ating mga kawc^, 
mga amerikano at mga pilipino, 
ay nakapagpakita na ng kaha- 
ngahangang kabayanihang naka- 
pagpapasig'15, sa mga puso ng 
ating mga mamaniay5,n. Walang 
inaaksayang hakbang na tiwgod 
sa pagtatanggol ng kapuluang 
ito at ang mga Icawal nating na- 
kikilaban ay nagsusuniakit sa 
pakikipaglanms sa mga kalahan 
sa lahat ng dako. 

"‘Ang ating mga mamamayang 
Sibil av nagpakita ng kahanga. 
hangang pagtunad sa disiphna at 
ng katapangan. Nagtitiwala ako 
na ang diwang ito na siyang pn- 
mapatnubay sa atin ay mapanga- 
ngalagaan sa boong panahong 
itata.gal ng digmaan. 

""Ginagawang lahat ang maka- 
kaya ng pamahalaan ninyo up^ng 
mapangalagaan at mailigtas ang 
mga mamamayang hlndi nakiki- 
paglaban, lalonglalo na ang mga 
babai at mga bata- Tungku m 
ng lahat na makipagtulungang lu- 
bes sa lahat ng kaparaanan sa 
mga Pinuno. ItinataguMm Jo 
inyong lahdt na maging niahi-

negoslo at hanapbuhay na gaya 
ng dati, ginagawa ang lahsft u- 
pang matuhingan ang ibang na 
sa panganib. Lalo nang kailagan 
ninyo ang pagtitipkl sa lahat ng 
pagkaing paniistos at gawin ang 
lahat nang niagagawa npapg 
mag-ani ng mga pagkain na ka- 
kailanganin ninyo at ng iba. Lub- 
hang mahalagang gawin natin 
ang lahat sa abot ng ating lakjts 
upang makapag-ani ng mga pag- 
kaing kailangan ng ating mga 
mamamayan, lalo na ng ating 
mga kawalan na nakikipagbaka. 

Tto ay lalo nang nadarama ng 
mga naninirahan sa mga pook na 
hindi pa tuwirang inaabot ng 
mga kilusan ng kaaway. 

Ibig kong ipagunita sa mga ma- 
mamayang naninirahan sa Kabi- 
sayaan at Mindanaw ang kani- 
lang fungkulin upang tumulong 
sa hansa sa bagay na ito. at ga- 
win ito kalakip ang gunita na 
ang gayon ay siya nilang tung- 
kulin sa pangbansang pagsisikap 
na ating ipinakiita alang-alang 
sa ikapagtatanggol ng tinubuan 
nating lupa. Ang mga pinunong 
bayan sa mga pook na iyon ay 
siyang dapat na mangfuna sa ga- 
waing ito, at plnahihintulutan ko 
silang tumipon ng mga lupa at 
paggawa, kung kinakailangan, u- 
pang mapalakas ang produksion. 
Kailangan natin ang bigas at ma- 
ts, baka at baboy, manok at gu- 
lay, at ang mga ito ay lalo na- 
ting kakailanganin habang luma- 
la on. 

Ibig kong pagpagunitaan ka-^ 
yong lahat laban »a mga allnga^-^ 

ngaw at pagpapalaganap na IkW 
nakalat ng kaaway o ng mga na- 
bibilang sa Ikalimang hanay. Ang* 
mga ito ay naglalayong sumira

matatag na kalooban ng ating; 
mga mamamayan. Ang balita ay^ , 
ipagkakaloob sa inyo sa pama^-

tayong makipaghamok na tulad! 
sa mga bayani, nguni‘t maging 
sa pakikilamas ay kailangang gu- 
mawi tayo nang maginoo at tulad 
sa mga binyagan. 

Itinatagubilin ko sa lahat ng 
mamamayan ng Pilipinas na ma-

Magkakaroon ng maraming 
pagpapakasakit, nguni’t nagtiti-

Next Assembly To Push 
Amendment Of Ghartei 

Will First; Secure 300,000 Votes Be- 
uiunding Second Term 
For Quezon 

While President Manuei B, Quezon is app^ently against the ptan 
t« amend, the Constitution so as to allow the re-election of the Presid- 
ent, -members of the National As sembly and. provincial governors have 
tentatively agreed to make the electorate demand directly his re- 
election by means of a plebiscite.- President Quezon, it is said, will 
agree to serving again only.if SOOiOOO affirmative votes are secureib 
The proposal to take up the the proposal to the people for a 
nendment in this session hsIi^^rnfc»' 



amendment in this session has 
been given up, it is said. The re- 
election proposal will be acted 
upon by the next Assembly when 
300,000 citizens have voluntarily pe- 
titioned for the President's re- 
election, Otherwise, the chamber 
not proceed with the constitu- 
tional amendment. 

Splons .and .provincial executives 
plan to conduct a drive to secure 
the required number of signatures 
to the petition, which will be sent 
to the President before the com- 
ing, election for assemblymen. The 
petition \vill ^be submitted before 
the end of year so that the 

next chamber will be i able to adopt 
a resolution amending the constir 



. ttiiu. Lilts pruviiiuacti s^vernors were 

nxtion early next year and submit ; pj-esident Quezon's guests at lun- 



vote in accordance with constitu 
tional requirement, 

Le^slators are certain* that more 
than 300,000 citizens, especially 
those belonging to labor organiza- 
tions, will demand President Que- 
zon's re-election. If the Chief Exe- 
cutive bows to this petition he is 
as good as re-elected, 
man Dominador M. Tan declared. 

President Quezon, according to 
legislators, is more interested in 
the re-election of assemblymen 
than in his own. He told legis- 
lators that their re-election 
would mean a ratification by the 
people of the present administra- 
tion.. ^ ,

Kapagkarakang inapatalasta-

Upon learning of the approval by 
President Sergio Osmena of the bill 
providing for a life pension of PIOOO 
a month to Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon, 
widow of the late President Manuel 
L. Quezon, her friends expressed 
gratitude to the Chief Executive and 
the members of the Congress of the 
Philippines who saw fit and proper 
t\o a.pipiriove flhie Law. 

However, the Quezon group spokes- 
man declared that the pension is not 
really a necessity of Mrs. Quezon as 
she is can support her family, but

Mrs. Quezon and her three children

Quezon's Death 



^ heavy heart that we learn about the death oC 
in a sanatorium in New York. Whatever be 
ms sins and mistakes in the past, we cannot but ae^.iO.vj 
death, especially knowing that he died in virtual exile, far from 
the country and people for whom he had labored for well-nigh ; 
naif a century. We condole with all those who shai'e in the grief 
over his unfortunate demise. 

No matter what our political leanings and loyalties in the \ 
past, we cannot but admit the role played by Mr. Quezon in fight- 
ing for Filipino autonomy. As resident commissioner at Wash- 
ington, he secured the passage of the first Philippine autonomy ' 
act, the Jones Law, in 1916. His is the now classic lino, “Better 
a government run like hell by Filipinos than one run like heaven 
by Americans^'. Had he his way, the Philippines would probably 
have been spared most of the hoiTors of this war of liberation. 
But he was thwarted in- his efforts, and was always conceded only 
half-way successes in his bargaining, with the American congress 
and presidenr. Wall Street had Philippine economy in its vise- 
like grip and Quezon had to submit to many humiliating compro- 
mises, most disgraceful of which was the recent independence act 
with its onerous military and naval reservations clauses, a Machia- 
^ gesture forced upon a dying man’s unresisting 

will by an unfeeling American president. Knowing how loudly 
Quezon protested against those clauses in the Hai'e-Hawes-Cutting 
Act, we can only surmise how its imposition hastened his death. 

But death has something final about it. Death has put finis 
^ career. As far as we of the Philippines are concerned, 
while we respect his memory, we accept . the. unalterable fact that 

u agi'eements and compromises 

entered into with the American government, in 
efforts to keep a hold on Filipino sympathy in this 
\\ar. The curtain falls completely on the Commonwealth Gov- 
captivity and the lights of the stage are turned off 
on the disgraceful independence measure forced bv the U. S. Con- 
gress upon a dying man. 

And now, we turn our realistic eye on the contemporary scene 
Quezon's forcible departure from the Philippines, 
things have happened so fast and so decisively that they stand 
contrast to the many half-way accomplishments allow- 
ed by the past regime. In less than two years of Military Ad- 
ministration, the Philippines was proclaimed an independent Re- 
^ Constitution framed and approved by the best Fili- 
a law-making body composed of elective Filipinos, and 

thf coun1?i to reconstruct 

tne country and help the nation rise over the ruins of war. 

unilateral Pact of Allivance entered into with Jaoan 

. — f Nppons fighting forces in these trying times of actual 
warfare. How different from the onerous and humTliating cSldi 
America! For while the Pact of Alliance with 
Japan gives actual protection to our freedom, the military and 
naval reservations proposed by America, as the price of a dubious 
independence to be granted us if and when AmerL shall haJe 

win^sSnd'^as^?n%ffr ® reconquered our free country, 

wm stand as an affront to our national sovereignty and as a

The people’s court bill which was 
passed during the last session was 
signed in a hurry by the President in 
view of the need for quick action. 

It is believed most if not all the 
22 remaining bills will receive his fa-^ 
vorable action. Only possible cause 
of rejection for any of these bills 
would be the insertion of provisions 
which congress incorporated on its 
initiative. 

Some of the bills pending action 
are: the bill making Manila’s mayoy 
elective, the nationalization of labor, 
nationalization of retail trade, pen- 
Sion for McsL..fliis2pn, creation of an ^ 
agricultural machinery and equip- 
ment corporation, creation of the bu- 
reau of labor, rehabilitation of the 
insurance system and the bill on 
Philippine membership in the Bret-

The cabinet had recommended ap- 
proval of the P10,000,000 item in the 
appropriation act for a 45-day back 
salary payment to government bfid- 
cials and employes. The cabinet like- 
wise urged approval of 12 bills pass- 
ed during the last special session* of 
congress as follows: 

1. ApfiJropriating P20 ,000,000 for the reha«

Let me explain. During’ the ^sh to say love you,” they 
more than three years of Japan- only succeed in grinning, “I rob

was a veritable reign of terror in mean.) 

crescendo to the end, with mass don’t know father make 

rape and massacre thrown in for ^Poech,” I would plead, 

good measure, the Jap kempei “Yes, he make speech. He say 

blamed me for everything my fa- . ‘Liripino be, patient — America 



ther said or did or failed to ay 
or do. Euthless and sadistic to the 
core as the kempei was, one can 
readily imagine how unpleasant 
were the consequences. 

With Qu^ej^ou my fa- 

ther went to Corregidor and later 
to Washington, leaving behind his 
loved ones. (Why he had to ^o

allowed to bring his entire family

no speech. Maybe Americans pre 



'with him including his valet is pare speech. Then maybe Ameri- 
j.- \ TT^ cans tell father, ^you deliver 

speech.’ So father speaks radio. 
Americans very clever propagan- 
da.” 

I could not say much in cold 
rebuttal. I remembered too well 
the proclamation of the Jap Com- 
mander-in-Chief imposing death 
penalty on “any person who dis- 
turbs the minds of the officials or 
the people.” You see, I was not 
enjoying^ either the freedom or the 
security of a iiefugee in distant 
ucxxxa - — WashiAgton, like my friend Cen- 

to face the music here, or what- ^r^l Romulo whose charming wife 
ever sodnded like music to the. change her name and leave 

unmusical ears of the Japanese residence during the Jap oc- 

masters, who never failed to show cupation, travelling incognito from 
us that our misery was their “co- place to place I was too near Fort 
prosperity.” In truth, on the very Santiago where the ruthless Kem- 
day^ the banzai-ing Japanese pei-tai was applying hourly such 
forces entered Manila I experienc- 



still a puzzle to me.) He was in 
America with the refugee Philip- 
pine Commonwealth government. 
Thus he was where he could talk 
and act freely without fear of 
being later grilled, slapped, and 
jitdoed by heartless gorilla-like 
Kempei agents, who are past- 
masters in all the refinements of 
torture. 

Had To Face The Music 
Not being in the States, I had 



inliuman methods of torture as 
water-cure, nail-pulling, and acid- 
burning to all suspects. 

. Wainwy^ght Had To Yield 
Even General Wainwright, the . 

. hero of Bataan and Corregidor, 

; had to yield to imperious Japan- 
: ese demands, and much against 
' his will had to broadcast before 
haughty Jap officers an order to 
^ all his brave and trusted men to ■ 

^ lay down their arms and surren- 
der. So did all the spiritual lead- ^ 
ers of the Philippines from the 
highest prelate down to the low-^ 
est minister, priest, or missionary.'*^ 
Life is so dear sometimes that ' 
even the golden promise of eternal 
life ' in the hereafter fails to con- 
vince us to throw off our mortal 
coils. 

And what shall we say about 
General Manuel Roxas whose pat- 
riotism and loyalty to^ America 

are beyond dispute? Did he not i 
succumb like tlie rest of us who 
are not 'super-patripts to the 
threats of the Jap Kempei, going 
to the extent of signing the pup- 
pet Republic’s constitution, ac- 
cepting the chairmanship of the 
National Planning Board and ta- 
citly approving, as ex-officio ca- 
binet member, the declaration of 
war against the Allied Nations? 
Certainly, he was not a collabor- 
ator for all that. Nor for that 
matter was General Wainwright 
in the eyes of ‘the American peo- 
ple. But I venture to say that had 
I been either General Wain'wright 
or General Roxas and done what 
each did, the public would have 
branded me as a damnable and 
hopeless collaborator. 

Heroes And Heroes 

Yes, my elder brother Emilio 
had the audacity to answer the 
Japs in May, 1942, that he would 
not cooperate with them, but, to 
my extreme sorrow, he did not 
live to tell the tale. They cut off ‘ 
his head after they had forced 
. him to dig his O'wn grave. Peo- 
ple say Emilio was a hero — I 
think he is and am quite proud 
of him — although he was never a 
refugee like my good friend, Gen-^ 
eral Romulo, now a self-made ' 
hero, or the mountain-sheltered 
and mountain-bred guerrilla lead- 
er, Tomas Cabili, whom the Com- 
monwealth government had to 
send to the United States as a 
post-war refugee. 

Although I am not here or 
Washington or Lanao, still I could 
have emulated my elder brother. 

I was sufficiently stirred and in- 
spired to do something reckless 
when I heard of his heroism; but 
then why give the Japs the satis- 
faction of butchering all the Os- 
menas?

The dreaded ‘‘zona” amply proved

instead, as was shown in the case 
of Mrs. Emmanuel Baja and her

one thing, Mx^J^imzan gave them the wrong start by ap.

I and connections are the very antithesis of the philosophy ury 
derlying the establishment of state corporations. For an^ 

' other, the stewardship of the NDC and its multiple subsi

Sir: The enactment of a legisla- 
tion providing for a life pension 
for the widow of our late Presi. 
dent is certainly laudable and we 
hope that the legislature in its 
next session will not forget the 
plight of the widows of fallen 
guerrilleros who gave their lives 
for the same cause for which Pres. 
Quezon sacrificed his life. . 

Our true and real guerrilleros 
should not be overlooked^ those 
guerrilleros who, for three years^ 
more or less, had lived in the ma! 
laria-infested forests and .jungles 
of the country, covering their 
backs with .burlap, subsisting oif 
roots and suffering all kinds o' 
privations. These people now ex 
pect to receive their full back pa 
because they received no mor 
than the so-called partial, salar 
given them by their officers duj

labor g~ir. Commonwealth 






8y ESMERALDO^E. DE LEON 

COURIER Editorial Staff 



Ten years ago today, the late^, 
President Manuel L, Quezon on the 
occassion the inauguration of 
the Philippine Commonwealth said: 

“Wo are living today amidst the 
storm and stress of one of the most 
tragic epochs of history. Acute un- 
employment and economic distress 
threaten the stability of govern- 
ments the world over. The very 
foundations of civilized society are 
shaken. The common man alone 
can save humanity from disaster. 
It is our duty to prove to him that 
►under a Republican system of gov- 
ernment he can have every opport- 
unity to attain : his happiness and 
that of his family. Protection to 
labor, especially to working women 
and minors, just regulation of the 
relations between labor and capital 
in industry and agriculture, solicit- 
ous regard on the part of the gov- 
ernment for the well-being of the 
masses are the means to bring about 
the needed economic and social equi- 
librium between the component ele- 
ments of society. 

That was ten years ago to the 
day. 

H 0 w near to that social equi- 
iibrium that the late President had 
dreamed of are we today? 

The answer to this is the present 
social and economic status of the 
working class. IVhile it is true 



trends lii other progressive coun- 
ties. 

Today the ordinary Filipin® 
orer knows that under the law he 
^ould work only eight hours a day 
He also knows that as union mem- 
ber he is protected against any ex* 
ploitation by an unscrupulous env 
ployer. He knows farther that he 
KS entitled to over-time pay and to 
compensation, if injured in line of 
duty. 

All these have been brought 
about by the unselfish attitude of 
the government towards the wel- 
tare of the laboring class. 

O, principally the gratitude of 
Philippine labor for whatever con- 
cessions It now enjoys must be con- 
secrated to the late President Que- 
zon who as early as 1908 alreadv 
manifested his progressive' stand 
or the social security of the massee 
by pres^ting in the initial session 
of the irst Pldlippine Assembly a 
bill creating the Bureau of Labor. 

This bill was approved and 
Bureau of Labor began operation in 
only, 1UU9. This was followed by 
Che enactment of the Woman and 
Child Labor Law in 1923 ^, 
v/orkmeu's Compensation Act in 
the Philippine Bice Share 
lenancy Act in 1933, the creation 
of the Department of Labor in the 
same year, the enactment of th« 



that the government has from time ^ight-Hour Labor Law, also in 
to time enacted progressive meas- the creation of the Court 

ures designed to ameliorate the liv- iJidustrial Relations in 1936 and 
ing .conditions of the masses, labor ; the enactment of the Minimum 



at this juncture finds itself bewil 
dered in a maze of social upheavals, 
the most tumultuous of which was 
the recent global conflict which 
razed the whole world to the 
ground.* 

It is true that Philippine labor 
has struck out for itself and gained 
some latitude. The Filipino wag^ 
earner is now aware of his prero- 
gatives. He is no longer the timid 
and passive peon who is content 
with the pittance his master casts 
at him. 

Thru the processes of labor leg- 
islations and the awakening ol 
labor conscious elements to the new 
channels opened to them by a de- 
mocratic form of government, Phil- 
ippine labor marched abreast labos 



Wage Law, also in 1933. 

On August 23, 1928, the Nation- ' 
al Assembly enacted a law author- 
izing the President to enter into 
negotiation with owners of landed 
estates for the purpose of leasing 
such estates and to sublet the «»«•».- 
to bona-fide occupants or similarly 
qualified persons. 

These, m chronology, are the 'm> 
rious steps taken by an almost 
ternal administration in its desire 
to enhance the life of the common 
effort of the “Union Obrera Demo- 
cratica”, a. labor union founded in 
1902 which spearheaded the local 
movement for the recognition of 
the rights of labor in its dealings 
with capital.

joy at being back to his native

"I completed my high school at

he answered when he was asked 
whether he had gone to school 
while in America. "I finished one

He said he was not sure, as to 
what course he will take, and he 
may either enroll at the Santo To-

WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 (PSP). 
--Though generally unknown; 
the fact is Col. Manuel Nieto, 
Presidential tsenior aide, has beeiij 
a Brigadier General since early

He was made a general ‘ before 
for purpose of contacting guerri- 
llas, a mission which the late 
desired . A1 - 

though his appointment was al-

Quezon to forego his wearing a

sults could be obtained by ap- 
pearing with lesser rank. How- 
ever,' Quezon’s^ illness prevfented 
his departure. 



According to late reports from

Pass Resolution 
Of Gratitude 

For the success of his mission 
in the United States which has a 
far reaching effect on the rehabili- 
tation of the Filipino masses, the 
Loyalist Union unanimously pass- 
ed a resolution of gratitude to Pre- 
sident Sergio Osmena who is due in 
Manila tomorrow afternoon 

The union is particularly grate- 
ful to the President for the aid 
of the United States to war victims 
in the Philippines, such as tlie one 
billion pesos reparation fund for da- 
mages suffered during the emer- 
gency. 

The resolution will be presented 
to the President upon his arrival 
by a delegation of officials of the 
union headed by Manuel Reyes, 
president. 

It will be recalled that last Au- 
gust the union also passed a reso- 
lution urgng the President to head 
a mission to the United States to 
aasten relief to the Philippines. 



Upon the President’s death, 
Nieto, out of courtesy wrote 
Vice-President Osmena explain- 
ing the situation. To date he has 
not received any reply. The fact 



is widely known that Osmena 
courses all military affairs cor- 
■»^espondence to Col. AlejandiV 
Melchor. Nieto is still wondering' 
in what drawer of Melchor’s desk 
his letter lies .

With the bugles, wedges in the

The President's first sentences,

ginning to disperse, apologetically 
at first, and then boldly. Pour

enthusiastically . PA men stump-

warmly when PA back pay was

Towards the end, a few drops 
fell and Mrs. Osmena opened her

Was not a brilliant speech. There 
was no oratory, none of your j

The simplicity of it was not even; 
impressive. Yet it was an im-f

The occasion, far from creat-

in directing the people's thoughts

not after all merely a welcomeu 
It had more important purposes: 
to clarify the objectives of the

Although she betrayed deep emo-

nor that of swanky Secretary of Fi-

somebody mistook for Melchor P. 

Aquino, the braintrust of Speak- 
er Jose C. Zulueta, attracted at- 
tention. 

It was what the returning Fili- 
pino women after four years in the 
states had on their hair and on 
their bodies that drew attention. 

There was one universal note: even 
while the women of the Philippines 
were cutting their hair, the female 
population of America were rais- 
ing theirs. 

Everyone of the new arrivals, 
from Mrs. Quezon down to Carmen 
Montinola, had what somebody in 
the press car remarked as a *‘6a- 
yongJ^ Yes, a veritable counter- 
part, which was the mark of men's 



Osmena and the President liim- 
self, Mrs. Quezon visited her for- 
mer home. 

The Blessed Madonna from 
Italy, reverently adorned on the 

side of a wall along the driveway 
where the Quezons used to say a 
few prayers, was the first mark 
of the old home Mrs. Quezon ins- 
tantly recognized . 

Together with the President 
and Mrs. Osmena, Mrs. Quezon 
muttered a short prayer. 

Desperately trying to stave off: 
inevitable tears after picking her 
way along the garden at the back, 
of their former home, Mrs. Que- 
zon looked up at the remaining 
wall of their house and noticed 
,that her initials incribed on the 
top '‘were still there." 

She burst into tears when her 
niece, Mrs. Amado Amador came 
and embraced her. She was simi- 
larly affected at the first sight of 
her aging relative and keeper of 
her former home, Jacinta Lopez. 



panese occupation. One was not 
worth mentioning about if one did 
not carry a bayo7ig during the Ja- 
panese regime. One was either 
carrying bagfuls of money, to pay 
for one single meal that would cost 
PI . 00 today, ten months after libe- 
ration; or a bagful of camote or 
kangkong, or panocha. 

Now, what men used to carry on 
both hands last year, the returned 
Filipino women are carrying on 
their heads. We don't know the 
exact word for it, but Courier^a 
Cita Trinidad said something with 
a Frenchy accent. At any rate, 
the hayong on top of women's 
heads will be the style note of the 
Christmas season and after. 

Beauticians had better shelve 
their shears. They should rather 
of tonics that would make every 
strand grow at least one inch eve- 
ry week, so that by Christmas 
time, every society darling and 
every matron can sport a bayong 
on her head. 

The flapper era is over; the age 
of long hair is back. That might 
go for the women, as well as the 
men. Never mind if we also en- 
courage the lice industry, which 
some beautician alleges to have 
disappeared during the flapper 
era. 

Maria Clara is back: she came 
back in the person of Mrs. Que- 
zon.

After a last eye-sweep of the 
house, Mrs. Quezon raised hei^ 
left hand to her tear-dimmed 
eyes and seemed to hide her 
cheeks among the necklace of Leii 
adorning her neck . 

Then, smiling bravely, she mo- 
itored to their residence in Gil- 
more Avenue, San Juan, where 
friends awaited her.

By C!TA TRINIDAD 

m, , Editorial Staff 

J lie plane circled over Nichols 

Field a few minutes before two I President Osmefia, who 



o clock yesterday afternoon, nosed 
downward and made a graceful 
three-point landing at exactly 2 :U1. 

When the door of the plane open- 
ed, and President Osmena attired 
m his conventional suntans, appear- 
ed at the doorway, the 19-gun sa- 
lute in his honor began. He waved 
to the crowd, stepped back into tiie 
plane and emerged leading by the 
arm Doha Aurora Aragon j widow 
of the late President Manuel L. 
Quezon. Mrs. Quezon waved a chif- 
fon han’akerchief in the air and des- 
cended, assisted by the President, i 
while she daubed tears from her 
eyes. Behind them followed Sera- 
pio Canceran, private secretary to 
! the President, Professor Vicente G. 

; Sinco, adviser to the President ; and 
secretary of Finance and Mrs 
J aime Hernandez, 

Mrs. Quezon was welcomed in a 

; warm embrace by the wife of the 
President. Both cried unashamedly. 

Then the President embraced and 
kissed Mrs. Osmena, while Mrs. 
j Quezon shook hands with Secretary 
I Montelibano. General Jalandoni 
then stepped forward, whereupon 
Mrs. Quezon, on seeing the former 
aid-de-camp of her deceased bus- 
oand burst again into sobs. 

Around them, Filipino and Ame- 
rican photographers were busy ta- 
king pictures of the event. Mrs. 
Juezon spotted among them ‘‘Fat- 
Maglalang, Malacanan’s offi- 
cial photographer, even during the ^ 
lime of President Quezon, She ap- ‘ 
preached him and extended her , 
hand in a handshake that sent Mag- j 
lalang beaming. I 

The Philipine Army band then 
broke into the strains of the Arne- ! 
rican and Filipino national anthems^'; 
and everybody stood at attention 

Meanwhile, the rest of the Pre- 
sidential party had alighted from 
the plane. With the Quezon girls, 
Baby and Nini, were Alicia Afable, 
Elena Yulo, Jenny Araneta and Car- 
men Montinola, who took courses 
in leading American colleges for 
girls. 

The big crowd was at first held 
back but it soon broke the polic<> 
cordon and rushed forward to greet 
the arrivals. 

Senate President Manuel Iloxas. 
Speaker Jose Zulueta, Budget Com. 






shook hands with them. 

Mrs. Sotedad Ramos de Zulueta 
«^fe of the Speaker, placed a thick 
garland of sampaguitas and roses 
on Mrs. Quezon, who wore a catt-’ 
leya corsage on the left shoulder 
of her sports dress. 

Among the women wore Mrs. Ro- 
sas, Mrs. Singson Encainacion, 
Mrs. Jacobo Zobel, Mrs. Loling Pa- 
terno-Tuason, Mrs. Antonio Vas- 
quez, Judge Almeda-Lopez, Mrs 
I^mon Fernandez, Mrs. Aristeo 
L^aldo, Mrs. Francisco Limjap. 
Mrs. Lolita de Buencamino, Mrs. 
Manuel Moran, Miss Jovita Fuentes 
Dona Sofia de Veyra, and others.’ 

The young ladies who arrived 
were given a rousing welcome by 
Manila society’s younger set headed I 
by the President’s daughter, Rosie, 
and the Misses Lourdes Alunan 
‘Helen Benitez, Mrs. Mary Osmena,’ 
Corito Araileta. 

President Osmena then shook 
, hands with Lt. Gen. William Styer, 
oomanding general of the AFWES* 
PAG, Admiral Carl Kauffman, C.O. 
of the Philippine Sea Frontier, Ma^ 
jor Generals Basilio Valdes and A. 
Whitelock, and other U.S. and Phi- 
lippine military officials. 

The Special Guard of Honor was 
then inspected by the Chief Execu- 
tive, after which he stepped into 
his waiting car, sitting between 
Mrs. Quezon and Mrs. Osmena. 

President Quezon’s son, Manuel 
Jr., Baby and Nini Quezon, bther 
j’oung ladies in the presidential 
party, and Ah Dong, the late Pre- 
sident’s faithful valet who also ar- 
lived with President Osmena, were 
accommodated in different cars 
which motored out of Nichols Field 
in line, with President Osmena’s 
car at the head, escorted by motor 
cycles of the Malacaiian Presiden- 
tial Guard of Honor. 

Mrs. Quezon was escorted to her 
Gilmore (San Juan) residence, 
where she will stay temporarily 
pending her transfer to the Quezon 
Hacienda in Marikina, Rizal. The 
President and Mrs. Osmefia then 
proceeded to Plaza Miranda, where

In a proclamation issued yes ter 
day. President Sei'gio Osmefia or- 
dered the return of standard time 
iiv the Philippines effective at mid- 
night on December 1, 1945. Time 
will be set back one hour at the 
specified hour. Since the outbreak 
the war four years ago, the 
Philippines has been working un- 
der the daylight saving time, as a 
measure of emergency. The late 
President Maasifil^^L. Quezon 
adopted it toward the end of De- 
cember, 1941. When the Japs took 
over, they continued to enfonce 
daylight saving as it coiweided with 
Tokyo time.

garland of tiny, assorted orchids on 
President Osmefia before ■ sent

The American and Philippine na-

in although she has seen the 

like of such devastation in countries 
all over the world, still this is her 
country, and any damage done to it 
is ^personal and heartbreaking. 

America fully sympathizes with 
the Philippines, and the American 
people are intensely interested in 
our welfare and future,” Mrs. Que- 
zon stated. 

She has no future plans, her arri- 
val is still so filled with the weari- 
ness of the long journey, that she 
has not had the time to think be- 
yond tomorrow. 

The late President had no last 
words with her, for he was alone 
when he died. But as to the last mo- 
ments they had together, she could 
only answer with ^ the tears clouding 
her eyes. 

The children of the late President 
were busy with the duties of setting 
order in a household still unset- 
tled. While Mrs. Quezon attended to 
the many visitors and well-wishers 
that kept streaming in, Baby attend- 
ed to some trunks that had to be 
unpacked. It was, except for the con- 
stant mill of people who had -come to 
see her, just like an ordinary family 
home from a long voyage. But the 
flowers strewn about in every pos- 
sible container in the room, and the 
oil painting of^ the President hung 
upon a wall were mute indications 
of the tears that lay under the veil 
of graciousness and busy doings. 

The house that Mrs. Quezon and 
children have occupied is a concrete 
chalet, set in grassy lawns. It seems 
too small a house to be able to ac- 
commodate her household and reti- 
nue. She has still her personal aide, 
an amiable young man wearing the 
bars of an army captain. She still 
has the old Malacanan personal at- 
tendants that she and her husband 
had. 

The lady sets the example for gra- 
ciousness. She bids welcome to every 
comer with the old gentle little smile, 
the same cordial attention to every 
small request. If under that ' well

Quezon told of her impression 
upon first setting foot on the soil 
she had missed for more than 
three years. 

The warm reception given her 
at the airi>ort, she said, showed 
that the people and her friends

me and my family.” '•My oiily re-

FwtmMit Oamefia in Quisypo. That shoi^^a 
exceptional good taste for there waa fear 
in some quarterti that she might “outpop.

I am sure the President ia too big a 
man to atop any demon atratiem of the kind 
for the -widow of hia friend and colleague.

Veering the conversation to her 
departed husband, Mrs. Quezon 
murmured, “He died, and he died 
Dghting.” She said President 
ovr vj.^*v. ; QuGzon did iiot IcavG tL wopd for 

According to her, the American his people, because, “maybe he did 
people have a high regard for and ; not know he was going to die that 
keen s>anpathy toward the Filipi- morning.’’ In fact, according to ' 
nos. This is shown in their will- [her, he told his doctor, “I never i 
' ' ' • V. felt so well.” He passed away 

vwtnin half an hour after uttering 
those words. He died, according 
to her, just following the reading 
to him of the Sermon on the 
Mount by his physician. 

After the death of President 
Quezon, the family left for Lo.s 
Angeles, where they had resided 
up to their return here. 

Sho denied the rumor that she 
^ for an elective 
office. “I have no such plan now, 
and I am sure I want to remain 
a private citizen.” 

Her inain jioncern, she said, is 



nos. 

ingness to help the Filipinos back 
to their own feet. In the cam- 
paign for aid to war sufferers, the 
Philippines get a big share, she 
said. 

She was particularly apprecia- 
tive of the spirit of patriotism 
displayed by the* Filipinos living 
in the United States. When the 
|c;i!l came for them to help, Mrs. 

' Quezon said, they contributed li- 
berally, in efforts, and in money, 
for their country. 



Filipino women organized sew- 
ing circles in various cities of the 
, United States to make dresses for 
■ war-sufferers.. Mrs. Quezon and her 
two daughters. Baby and Zenaida, 
were members. “The three of us, 
working day and night, were able 
to make * a total of more than 400 
dresses for the needy in the Phil- 
ippines,” she said. They were then 
living in Los Angeles, she added. 

One of these days, she said, she 
will inquire from the proper auth- 
critics how many dresses have 
been actually received here from : 

Filipino organization in the United 
States. : — 



the welfare of her children and tlie 
care of their family belongings. 

A little before noon, Mrs. Ser-

no party but one— also his. 

It could be argued that she was 
his wife, that she was therefore clos- 
est to him, that If there are any plans 
he had that should be carried out

Mrs. Quezon will find plenty in

these, and weep. 

And yet she should not weep. For 
the wives of brave men should also 
be brave. And he lost his life for his 
country as truly as though he had 
fought with arms on the battlefield. 
And he lives today in the hearts of 
nullions who loved him, of millions 
who, even as they criticized him, 
would quote his latest statement; 
who even as they gossiped about him, 
crowed and gloried in his latest es- 
capade. He was a maii of magic, the 
people loved him, I suspect, as much 
for his faults, as for his virtues, and 
beyond such affection, people could 
not have farther gone. 

So now she is home. Her latest 
pictures show her with a head now 
of white, and about her a dignity, an 
air of quiet that Is sad and Indicative 
of what even she must have -gone 
through, over there. Surely she too 
must have suffered. In heart and spi- 
rit, what we too suffered here: the 
starvation, the deprivation, the wan- 
ton, senseless destruction. For this 
was the Commonwealth her husband 
loved, we the people for whom he 
fought, and our cause life’s work. 
And the wife of such a man could 
not but have embraced such a cause, 
the suffering of the heart and the 
spirit can often be more intense, 
more acute, than any suffering borne 
by the flesh. And then her ultimate 
bereavement puts her at last in a 
class with om own agony; her loss 
was inflicted by war as truly as if 



his plans, therefore his ability. Tills 
Illusory attitude would draw a pa- 
rallel between Mrs. Quezon and Mrs. 
Roosevelt. Both have lost husbands 
who labored mightily each for his 
country. They were men endowed 
with the personality to ride over op- 
position and still hold loyalty, to rise 
always to the challenge of a difficul- 
ty. Both died before the end of the 
fight they had fought with such lus- 
ty spirit. Some obvious dullard will 
rise to shout that what parallel exists 
between Mrs. Quezon and 
Roosevelt ends right there. 

What a sad thing it would be if 
Mrs. Quezon indeed entered politics. 
Two separate little birds have said 
two separate things. One says the 
Administration has given Mrs. Que- 
zon every courtesy It is possible to 
offer, officially, and unofficially. The 
other says Mrs. Quezon consults the 
leader of the opposition over every 
single problem, big or little, personal, 
or otherwise. Mrs. Quezon’s partisan- 



psychological attitudes that have 
made old men out 'of babes- in arms, 
so that there is a generation to be 
that will play with murder, and de- 
light in' sin. Will the widow of the 
President see the need of her hand 
in the re-education of childhood, so 
that it is' returned to innocence, to 
wholesome' values? 

She could identify herself with the 
fight against tuberculosis, that dread 
disease to" which her own husband 
fell prey. In the eradication and ar-

The People's Plea 

/ T is interesting to consider Mrs. Ouezo n!s plea for unity 
and to %ohat elements it couidrfossihly he specifically di- 
rected. 

That we need unity today above all else goes without 
saying. And it can more or less be safely assumed that we 
do have unity — unity in fundamental principles and aims; 
unity in the basic and ultimate faith in the democratic^pro- 
cesses whereby those principles and aims can best be served; 
and — although it may sound superfluous — unity in the con- 
viction that we need unity. 

And yet Mrs. Quezon’s plea — and it is not a new one — 
was and can be constantly directed to certain elements in the 
country, certain elements in the government. There are 
petty jealousies and suspicion that warp the mental process- 
es of some of our government men; there are petty ambitions 
and, in some cases, outright greed; there is again a stirring 
of that tendency to intrigue and to manipulate underhanded 
strings — there is bickering and mud-slinging and very little 
earnest work done in the rehabilitdtion of the. nation, politic- ■ 
ally, economically, or morally. 

We will see some of these contemptible traits register- 
ing again — in the possible elections noio being proposed, in 
the scramble for back pay, in the furious elbowing for sine- 
cures in the government, each little big shot trying to work 
things out for his oivn pet and useless little parasite. 

To these elements the plea of a tvell-known and xoell- 
loved Filipina is directed. It is the plea of a whole people. 
Must we wait for the plea to change to thunderous rebuke?

Quezon herself has confirmed the 

ZTt°' instructions, and 
this fact coupled with the testi. 
monies of some men present in 
the last meeting of the Quezon 
cabinet make the existence and 
nature of the said instructions be- 
yond cavil. 

President Osmena was present 
vhen the instructions were given. 
He knows, therefore. the whys 
and the wherefores behind the 
acceptance of high positions in 
the Republic by the men now be- 
ing accused of having collaborated 
with the enemy. 

And yet, up to the present, he 
has maintained a sphinx-like si- 
lence on the subject. The name, 
honor and reputation of most of 
our pre-war leaders are now at 
stake on the issue of collaboration 
and still not a word has come from 
him which could a long* way 
into purifying the disgraced 
atmosphere which now hangs over 
the country. 

Why? 

Has he become so hopeless old 
that even such an important and 
historic event he has already for- 
gotten? The hypothesis is ob- 
viously impossible. He has not 
forgotten to place his own men in 
the cabinet, in the provincial 
boards and in the town mayor- 
ships. And he has not forgotten, 
too, to weed out from the govern- 
ment men who are of definite 
pro-Roxas leanings or of doubt- 
ful political loyalty. 

Then why has he not said any- 
thing about the instructions of 
President Quezon?

^bhe is beginning to ask embarrassing questions. Did he 
fate any part in the isUmd-to-istand campaign that cuL- 
minted m the liberation of the PhUippinest Was he in 
on the fwd m in Japan? Did he abandon the glamour 
ond lush and glitter of the Waldorf-Astoria for the manly

the Phili^nes among the night birds of the great American 
Cities who go to bed when the people who work for a living 
go to their respective offices and fobs? Wm the motivation 
of his rise in the army be a military secret for all time? 

BUT the unkindest cut of all was dealt by the Spanish 
weekly, Infornuwiones, which banteringly and subtly sug- 
gested unflattering thoughts about General Nieto, besides 
speaking lightly of his military prominence. Saying that 
Quezon was incomplete without Nieto, the Informaciones 
dubbed him “secretarisimo.” People who recognize the 
varied shades of the incomparable malice and sarcasm of 
the Spanish language will agree with us that “secretarisimo” 
is the ultimate of irreverence when it is applied to a sancti- 
fied creature like Manuel Nieto.

National Unity 






^ '"Vjujo'b • *n ^ ( <i^ 






Were Quezon alive today, na- 
tional unity would not be hard toi 
achieve, even in the midst of such I 
turmoil as Philippine politics 
finds itself in today. 

This is the consensus of opinion 
among congressional circles and is 
shared by non-political .thinkers 
who, having no political ends to 
gain, have a genuine claim to hav- 
ing the welfare of the country at 
heart. . 

Presid<mt.^Q«£zon was a politi- ! 
cian of such temperament as to 
welcome a showdowv before the 
people. But he was also a states- 
man of such calibre as to subor- 
dinate personal or party consider- 
ations for national well-being. 

Dr. Eufronio M. Alip, president 
of the new institution at Dapitan' 
which bears the late President 
Quezon’s name, is one of the non- 
political thinkers '«iio believe that 
the Philippines should renfain 
united. Dr. Alip believes that 
with a solid front, we can success- 
fully work out, our rehabilitation: 
problems and resolve our economic 
difficulties. Otherwise, the Ba- 1 
taan College president thinks, we 
would fail.

Tbe Lilieral and Gonseryalive Parties 

THg organization of the Conservative^ anU i-iiberai par- 
ties corresponding, respectively, to the Osniena and Roxas 
wings of the Nacionalista party deserves the unstinted en- 
couragement and support of the country’s civic-spirited 
elements. Diehard Nacionalista partisans may not admit 
that the old party, as the dispenser of political plums and 
other f o i m s of [latronage, has outlived its useful- 
ness; but the unassailable fact is that there is an over- 
whelming,sentiment among the masses and the intelligent- 
sia for its dissolution and for the birth of two strong, well- 
balanced parties. Independence reexaminationjst Romero, 
Zulueta, Mrs."> Qugzo ii and Mendez, champions of fusion 
and reconciliation, should realize that they are acting 
against public opinion in seeking to avert a split between 
Roxas and Osmena. 



Although the Osmena faction will be known as the 
Conservative party, it should not be considered as the party 
of reactionaries any more than the Roxas’ Liberal party 
should unquestionably be regarded as the party of liberals. 
Conservatism and liberalism, like fascism, are much-abused 
words. The label, as Cardozo says, counts for little. It is 
possible for the Roxas men to advocate illiberal measure.? 
and for the Osmena men to espouse very progressive prin- 
ciples.

She emphasized that the trials 
and tribulations, the hardships and 
sufferings of the years when the 
country was under Japanese rule 
a stronger people of the 
Filipinos and that they were now 
ready to share that beautiful real, 
ization of a dream long cherished 
especialy by the late President 
Quezon. 



Those who waver now are not

greater portion of the crowd, she 
said, am widow, my children 
like yours, are orphans... I have 
always thought of you in my

Mrs. Quezon Raps Opponents 
Of Philippine Independence 



Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon, widow 
of. the late President of. the 
Philippines, bitterly denount'i^d 
the opponents of Philipine ind<a. 
pendence who call themselves 
‘‘re-examinationists’’ at the necro- 
logical program held* In honor of 
Filipino war dead at tbv> t’Uty 
Hall yesterday afternoon 



BefqiX' her audience, which was 
composed mainly of city hclJ em- 
ployees, teachers, student, aijd 
widows and relatives of Filipinos 



who died during the Japan«f^S9 cc 
cupation, she posed the question: 
"‘Shall we give up the idea of in- 
dependence for a few cans of sal- 
mon, A long, lustv "*no” /oamo 
from the public. 



Philippine independence, accord- 
ing to Mrs. Quezon, is no obstacle 
to rehabilitation and relief “no- 
cause America will keep her 
pledge.^' As a matter of fact, she 
added, “we do not need to beg f oi 



relief because the 'American pc o- 
pl are duty bound to give it to us." 

She recounted how her husband 
had labored hard “that the Philip-^ 
pines might win her liberty-' 
“Even at the la;st moment of big' 
death, your Manuel Quezon craved 
for independence/' she said. 

Bluntly, she added: “Tf any one. 
of you among this crowd still en-' 
tertains the doubt that we des^^rve 
our freedom next year, then strike 
out the name of Quezon in youi 
memory. Because those who do 
not love freedom cannot love my 
husband.'' 

“We cannot, now turn back," 
she continued. "We cannot now 
abandon what we had bought at 
the cost of 80 much blood." 

Mrs. Quezon concluded her 
speech w'th a plea for un^ty. 
said there is always truth in the 
maxim that In unity there is 

strength..

P.l IDEAL FOR 
SMALL BUSINESS, 
SAJSJi ENVOI 

MANILA, Dec. 17 — (Reuter) — 
Maury Maverick, special Presiden- 
tial envoy who is touring the Far 
East in the interests of small bu- 
siness, yesterday paused, in Manila 
long enough to pay Uubute to the 
Filipino people and then took off 
on a flying survey tr^p of the Phil- 
ippines. 

During his brief stay in Ma.iila 
Sunday, Maverick— who is a for- 
mer Congressman from Texas- 
said that ‘These islands seem ideal 
ground for small business dt^veiop- 
ments. 

“The land is rich, the people are j 
industrious and they do business : 
in the American way/’ he told the | 
information departn^ent of the ! 
American High Commissioner. | 
“Small businessmen, both Ameri i 
cans and Filipinos,” he said, “have ' 
an unlimited opportunity to make 
good with the proper guidance,' 
counsel and assistance. The peo- 
ple of the Philippines have stood 
up under the test of war in a more 
heroic manner than any of the peo- 
ple of the British colonies. That 
is why I’m interested in .see’ng a 
sound economy based on small bu- 
siness enterprises rebuilt here.” 

On Sunday, with Col. Vicer.te 
Umali — ^former commanding of- 
ficer of Preeident^^Que^on’s Guer- 
rillas— Maverick toured Rizal and 
Laguna Provinces, according to the 
ARC’S Office. 

On his return from the south, 
Maverick is expected to hold a 
press conference on Wednesday, it 
was said. He will leave for Aus- 
tralia later in this weeK 

Maverick said he was “thrilled 
to hear .the exciting story of guer- 
11a operations,” and indicated he 
would include the story in his re- 
port to President Truman, He 
declared . that because of this he- 
roic performance of the Filipinos, 
he is “interested in seeing a sound 
economy based on small business 
enterprises rebuilt here.” 

Maverick is a house guest of 
High Commissioner McNutt dur-j 
ing his stay here. He arrived 
with a staff of five in a C-54 
which the war department assign- 
ed to him. I 

MANILA, Dec. 17 — (AP) — 
Maury Maverick, President Tru-' 
man's special envoy, said today the 
Philippines is fertile ground for 
* “lall business developments. 

“Small businessmen, both Amer- 
ican and Filipinos, have an un- 
limited opportunity to make good 
with proper guidance, counsel aind 
assistance,” he stated.

Quezon^ Political Testament 

mat distinguishes collaborationism in the Philippines 
±rom that m other countries is its dual aspect: legal and- 
extralegal. The legal aspect poses the question of whe- 
ther the cooperation extended to the enemy by the collab- 
orationists amounted to treason. The extralegal aspect in- 
volves the alleged Quezon instructions to high officials that 

should ‘pretei^d^ fo collaborate” with the enemy and 
at all costs ... to prevent the Ricartistas to hold the reins 
of government under the new regime.” Quezon instruct- 
ed the high officials, according to Laurel, “to cooperate 
short of taking the oath of allegiance.” 

Heretofore only vague rumors had given existence to 
the Quezon instructions. Those who should have personal 
knowledge of such instructions have refused to come out 
with a categorical confirmation of the same. But the Ho- 
ward statement to the effect that the acts of the collabora- 
tionists “were the result of their having carried out his 
(Quezon’s) personal and direct instructions,” had done 
much to dissipate the uncertainty as to the veracity of the 
instructions. There can be no doubt now that such instruc- 
tions were .given and that they constituted the bases of the 
acts of the collaborationists. 

Because the instructions did not specify details, the 
officials had to rely on their sound judgment and discretion 
under the conditions which circumstances thrust upon 
them. Some officials have doubtless exceeded the limits of 
proper collaborationism. Those Who were responsible for 
the capture of guerrillas, who wilfully abetted the enemy 
in his propaganda and ivar effort, who took advantage of 
the situation to enrich themselves and who in one way or 
another maliciously gave aid and comfort to the invader 
should be regarded as traitors: disloyal collaborationists 
They should be punished. 

But the majority of the officials, who, as acknowledged 
by President Osmena .in his Leyte speech, “had to remaii 
in their posts to maintain a semblance of government, tc 
protect the population from the oppressor to the exteni 
possible by human ingenuity and to comfort, the people iV 
their misery,” undoubtedly are heroes. The greatest ser- 
vice rendered by these loyal collaborationists was to pre- 
vent the Japanese from using the Ricartistas, “unscrupu- 
lous Filipino followers capable of any treason to their peo- 
ple.” Because they faced the Japs, protected the peoph. 
and acted as hostages for the fleeing government, and a‘ 
the same time spied upon the acts of the invad^er, discharg- 
ing their tasks under the most delicate and hazardous cir- 
cumstances, the loyal collaborationists deserve the grati- 
tude of the people. 

In order to settle once and for all the collabor itionisir 
issue, which is dividing the people, and hampering rehabi- 
litation, all those who have knowledge of Quezon’s instruc- 
tions should speak forth and not remain silent. President 
Osmena, Mrs. Quezon, Rm^s, even General MacArthur, if 
he knows anything about the instructions of his friend; 
should not keep the world in suspense about Quezon’s di- 
rections to the collaborationists, who are now unjustlj 
being branded traitors. 






Maverick, chairman of the Smal- 
ler War Plants Corporation of the 
U.S. government, arrived in Ma- 
nila Sunday. He is making a 
quick four-day trip through the 
Philippines investigating small bu- 
siness opportunities. 

The colorful Texan conferred 
with High Commissioner Paul V. 
McNutt on business developments 
in the Philippines. 

Maverick has visited various 
countries in the Far. East investi- 
gating small business opportunities 
for President Truman. -He arrived 
here with a five-men staff assign- 



to him by the War Department. 
He flew in from Shanghai after 
several weeks’ stay in China and 
Japan. 

Today Maverick took off again 
for a 36-hour tour of the southern 
islands, making stops at Tacloban, 
Agusan, Zamboanga and Iloilo. He 
is scheduled to return to Manila 
Tuesday night and leave for Aus- 
tralia Wednesday evening. 

Maverick expects to be back in 
the United States by the end of 
the year to make a report to Pres- 
ident Truman.

fSISON ACTED FOR 

GOOD OF coumy, 

averjitnesses 

By ONOFRE P, GUEVARA 

The supposed treasonable 
acts of Teofilo Sison, minis- 
ter of home affairs and ins- 
pector-general of the erts- 
while “Republic of the Phil- 
ippines,” were committed in 
obedience to a superior force 
or authority and for the pur- 
pose of preventing what would 
have been a major injury or 
a worse evil to the Filipino, 

people. , i! On his declaration that after the 

This was the gist of the testi-l; meeting in which he acted as 

I Piaster of ceremonies, at the ban* 
cmet that followed it Sison told him 
in private that he in fact sym- 



i Sison was never against the un- 
derground movement, declared At- 
ty. Rufino Buyao of Tayug, Pan- 
I gasman, and Pedro Kagaoan, now 
; »-aayor of Tayua. 

In direct examination, these wit 
messes who came from the home 
province of the accused tried to dis- 
claim as true the testimony of tbP 
prosecution witnesses on tjio allefif^ 
speech of Sison delivered in Tavue. 

For instance, they said, it is not 
true that Sison said ‘The Span- 
iards called the Filipinos pajrans; 
the Americans called us monkeys ; 
but the Japanese called us brothers* 
and neighbors.’’ Sison ho wove** 
said in that speech, according t^> 
these witnesses, that he was “nei 
I ther a pro- J apanese nor pro-Amer- 
, ican, but he was a pro-Filipino 



I SS j I cx^ 



monies of the first defense witness 
es, two of them today’s recognized 
political leaders of the nation, in 
yesterday’s resumption of the trial 
of Sison. The witnesses further 
told t»ho People’s Court that Sison’ s 
acts helped in the maintenance of 
peace and order during the chaotic 
days of the occupation. 

In the fully packed courtroom 
of the 5th division of the People’s 
Court, Senators Melecio Arranz 
and Eulogio Rodriguez, Sr., nar- 
ratted- the events daring -the first 
trying days of the enemy occupa^ 
tion. They related that the tlien 
recognized Filipino leaders who 
were left behind by the late Presi- 
dent Manuel L. Quezon met at the 
house vbf Jose Yulo (pre-war speak- 
er of the unicameral national as- 
sembly and later chief justice of the 
Philippine Supreme Court during 
the occupation) where they discus- 
sed and finally agreed on the best 
■^ways to deal with the newly-arriv- 
ed conquerors 

Both senators stressed in their 
testimonies the point that the co- 
urse adopted by the then provision^ 
al council of state was believed to 
be for the best interest of the ci- 
vilian population. Emphasis wa« 
also laid on the fact that a refusal 
to sign the “letter of response,” 
marked exhibit 24 by the prosecu- 
tion, would have spelled danger to 
any of the leaders

pathized with the guerrillas, the 
■j Tayug mayor was subjected to a 
i long and rigid examination by one j 
of the 5th division judges, Antonio 
Quirino. Incurring admissions and 
contradictions as a result of Judge 
Quirino’ s questioning, the witness 
confessed that he was “lost in a 
confusion.” He doggedly stuck, 

: however, to his statement that the 
defendant had to stage a “play” 
for the sake of the Japanese offi- 
cers present, among whom was Ge- 
►neral Sato. 



INTERESTING 
SIDELIGHTS 

One could not help admiring the 
undaunted and courageous manner 
of Solicitor General Lorenzo M. Ta- 
nada in cross-examining the pro- 
minent witnesses. To him a witness 
on the stand is a “witness,” rank 
or no rank. 

When Senator Arranz invariably 
gave an “I cannot remember” an- 
swer to his questions, Tanada snap- 
ped at him the question : * ‘Exactly 
what do you remember then, Mr. 
Senator?” 

It was undoubtedly the aging se. 
nator from Rizal who “stole the 
scene” from all the participants in 
yesterday’s court drama. Right at 
the start of his ’ testimony when 
__ — _ I asked to give his personal circum- 

Congressman Alfonso Menxioaft4| stances, Senator Rodriguez said

Rey Isip's Work 

*‘The Fighting Filipinos,’’ ori- 
ginal painting of Manuel Rey 
Isip, well-known Filipino artist 
now in New York, symbolizes 
the fierce independent Filipino 
spirit. In the late President 
Quezon’s words: it epitomizes 
that Filipino soldiers in the field 
and the civilians behind the 
lines were animated by one de- 
termination — ^to fight the invad- 
er until death and expel him 
from the Philippines. 

Isip executed .the figure in j 
oil. It was first shown in Rock- i 
efeller Center, in an exhibit of i 
the United Nations Information i 
Office, February 12, 1944. 

Statiatics on Mr. Isip: Born 
of poor parents in Mandalu- 
yong, Manila. Was a keen’ dab- 
bler in painting, music, litera- 
ture before going to the United 
States in 1936. At .the time he 
was illustrator of Liwayway 
and a free lance short story 
writer. He is now 40 years, lives 
with his wife and two children 
in Flushing, Long Island, Now 
York.

Rehearsing- at the El Cairo 
one peaceful Sunday morning, 
we have Hanz Menzi trying ,to 
iponcentrate on his steps for the 
prigodon to be danced at the 
iVSAC Victory Ball on the 22nd. 
We can’t blame him. After all, 
he does have pretty Lulu Cw)n- 
q >08 right in front of him . . . 

Col, Hem^ Gilhouser shows 
them how. Quite an old hand at 
the dance; while boss Manny 
Maiiahan seems to lose himself 
in the crowd, as he conscien- 
tiously goes into his dance. 

Helen Benitez gives instiuc- 
tions over the mike, patiently 
watching Maggie Ysinael Ro- 
berts turning to wrong partner 
Tom Benitez, while Nenu Liboro 
watches husband and enjoys her- 
self at his ^expense. 

Josefina and Ofelia Brias co- 
ming in rather late with escorts 
E dollar do, Leo Melian - and En- 
Hquito Brias. Mati Zobel decid- 
ed to leave early with Joe Mjs^ 
Micking, to see a luncheon en- 
gagement. Tch tch, such busy 
people. 

Trophy Ocampo gets on eve- 
rybody's nerves, mimicking her 
way all throughout the dance. 
After all, she is the life of the 
party and always the center of 
distraction. 



Vnding Alunan takes it all in 
and concentrates. At long last, 
one serious character among a 
gang of screwballs . . . 

We hear that Bahs Lanvmog- 
lia celebrated her birthday yes- 
terday with a big pai*ty at the 
ATC Officers’ Club. It coincid- 
ed with th6‘ breaking up of the 
fWing, as they have closed the 
office, to send the boys back to 
the States. Au revpir to a swell 
jbunch of boys. We’re sure their 
wives will appreciate the idea. 



Busily running around get- 
ting ads for the Gazette to be 
distributed to their guests on* 
the 22nd at the El Cairo Club, 
we-bave Misses Lyttle and 

Carmencita Arnaiz, properly es- 
corted by Danny Vazquez, Heinz 
Brower and believe it or not 
oiir grown up Nonong JO u^on . 



Seen enjoying herself in a 
strenuous game of ball, Miss 
Nena Garcia, our candidate for 
the contest of the VS AC’s Ara- 
bian Night Festival. She wore 
a cool white organdie blouse 
lovely red hair blowing in the 
breeze of their lawn on Taft 
Avenue.

OSMENA MAY TAKE 
WITNESS STAND

IN SISON TRIAL 






I 



Tresideiit Sergio Osmena may 
be called to testify before the 
People’s Court as defense \vitness 
in the treason case against Teofilo 
Sison, minister of home affairs in' 
the ‘^puppet Republic”, it was 
learned yesterday. 

The President, it is conjectured, 
may be asked to testify on the al- 
leged last instructions of the late 
Presi^gnt^f^iupJ to his 

cabinet before leaving Manila for 
Corregidor one bleak day of Dec- 
ember 1941. President Osmena is 
reported to have a first hand! 
knowledge of the said instimctions 
and will be put on the stand by 
I the defense to give his vei*sion of 
it. 

There has been conflicting ver- 
sion of Quezon’s alleged instruc- 
tions to his cabinet in 1941, 
although impartial sources likej 
Roy. Howard, American newspaper! 
tycoon, is repoi’ted to have ex-! 
pressed readiness to testify on 
this angle of the issue which is 
considered essential to the defense j 
pf all puppet officials. J 



In the administratioji proceed- 
ings for the estate of tho late Pre- 
•^dent Qu^on, instituted in the 
Court of First Instance, Manila, 
^^‘^ve been established: 
o* fpu Quezon left no will, 

X That his propertie.s, worth a 
httlo over P3()0,000, aro conjugal. 

o. -That there is absolutely no 
truth m the current rujnor in Ma- 
nila before the war that large 
sums of money belonging to Pres; 
Quezon were deposited secretly in 
the banks of Argentina. Mexico. 
Condon and Spain. 

Commenting on these rumors. 
Dona Aurora A. de Quezon, widow 
of the deceased President, said 
that it is a continuation of the ma- 
licious propaganda of the Presi- 
dent’s enemies in political cam- 
paigns that took place fifteen 
years ago. 









i; 



''Then, upon Quezon's death, 
Osmena look over the task cour- 
ageously and devotedly with the 
splendid results that.... toe could 
see with our own eyes . . 

The microscope of Joe must h(* 
the most powerful in the toorld! 



MISCELLANY. ... did you know 
that the plant Dona Aurora, named 
after the widow of the late Pres- 
ident Quezon, now sells for P30 a 
pot. . . that an enterprising phila- 
telist makes pictures from stamps 
he no longer cares for. . . he has 
cut the stamps (Cut to take any 
shape he likes.... and has been 
able to paste them so that they 
have made for him pictures of a 
newsboy hawking papers... a Fi-i 
lipino of the old school pounding: 

a floral arrangement after the- 

Chinese manner and so on some 

of these have to be scanned at a 
certain distance the better to see 
....they are the work of a man 
named Viceivte Genato and he’s not 
the man who used to be president 
of a club known in pre-war times 
as the Nucleo Solterii , , .

M. L. QUEZON’S EFFORTS TO MAKE MAJORITY

Hope Expressed Great Redeemer Might Yet Change 
His Mind For Party’s Sake 

By VICENTE L. DEL FIERRO 
Of The STAR REPORTER Staff 

The hand that rocks the is ±\\r> hatid f\liat rules the 

world. 

That same hand might yet rule the Philippines, if we are to be- 
lieve behind-the-scenes negotiations during the Christmas holidays 
wherein two women reportedly moved heaven and earth to save the 
■ Nacionalista party from falling apart. 



These two women are Mrs. Ma-< 
nuel L. Quezon and Mrs. Sergio 
Osmena who, according to influen- 
tial leaders from both the Roxas 
and the Osmena wings of the Na- 
cionalista party, appealed directly 
to nearly all members of Congress 
now in Manila to do their level best 
to prevent the disruption and even- 
tual disappearance of the Naciona- 
lista party by stopping at nothing 
to bring, together Sergio Osmena 
and Manuel Acuna Roxas under tjie 
same ticket. 

DIRECT APPEAL 

Mrs. Quezon and Mrs. Osmena 
are reported to have appealed di- 
rectly. to the big\yigs of both fac- 
tions to save the Nacionalista par- 
ty at all costs. The late President 
Quezon and Sergio Osmena were 
the joint founders of the Naciona- 
lista party to which everybody who 
is now somebody in the Philippine 
politics owes his power and promi- 



tegists have failed.

and Mrs. Osmena may work won-

ROXAS’ WEAKNESS AND 
STRENGTH 

Man, despite his reasoning pow- 
er, according to Anatole France, 
is still a sentimentalist. At heart, 
iNfanuel Roxas is sentimentalist. 

That is- the wonder of Manuel Acu- 
na Roxas — he is both a sentimenta- 
list and a realist. 

He sees the need for new blood 
in the government as well as the 
urgency of ending forever the re- 
gime of the one-party regime in his 
once benighted country. New blood 
even come from men who welcom- 
ed new ideas, regardless of party 
lines. Until he finally forms his 
own party^ Manuel Acuna Roxas 
can not be accepted as having over- 
looked the possibility that he could 
gear the Nacionalicca party to new 
thoughts and ideas and save a
