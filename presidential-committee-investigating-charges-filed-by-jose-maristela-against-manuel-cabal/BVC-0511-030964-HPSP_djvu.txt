Dtj&r President; 

| In', relation to the charges filed with the Secretary of 
Nati< t n>k^ Defense by Col. Jose G. Mar is tela, dated August 2, 

1961, against Lt. Gen. Manuel F* Cabal, Chief of staff of the 
Armed Forces Oj. tlie Philippines, of alleged graft, corrupt 
practices, unexplained wculth, conduct unbecoming an officer 
and a gentleman, etc., former President Carlos P. Garcia 
designated retired Justice of the Supreme Court Marceliano 
h. Montemayor as Chairman, Buenaventura Ocampo and Sotero 
Cabahug, retired Justices of the Court of Appeals and 
Basil .to J, Valdez and Guillermo Francisco, retired generals 
of the AFP, as members of the Presidential Committee to inves- 
tigate that part of the charges relating to unexplained wealth. 

The Committee, for several months, conducted hearings 
at which both parties, complainant and respondent, were duly 
represented by counsel. Numerous witnesses testified and many 
documents were introduced. In the course of said investigation 
and on October 18, 1961, Kdilberto B» Gallares, Assistant 
Executive Secretary, authority of the President, further 
authorized the Committee to "look into the charges relating 
to that of unexplained wealth as well as the other charges 
which are not of purely military character, provided the 
latter have already been filed against the respondent." 

Because of this additional authority, the investigation 
was naturally expanded and the Committee was unable to finish 
the investigation during the incumbency of ^resident Garcia. 

For this reason, and in order to give Your Excellency a free 
hand in the selection of the members of the Presidential 
Committee to continue and finish the investigation, the 
members of said Committee filed their resignations. However, 
on January 30, 1962, Executive Secretary Amelito K. Mutuc, in 
a letter of same date, informed the members of the Committee 
of the Presidential desire that they continue tiic investigation. 

The Committee finished the investigation shortly thereafter. 
Because of the voluminous records of the investigation, oral and 
documentary, especially those involving accounts where account- 
ants testified extensively on them, it was realized that a 
conscientious study of the said records with the view to arriving 
at a just and fair conclusion and making suitable recommendation, 
would involve about two weeks time* 

The committee members felt that because of the retirement 
of General Cabal in the AFP and his being allowed to receive 
his retirement pay, any findings and recommendation based on 
said findings to be made by the Committee might be academic 
and of no practical value and effect for various reasons.

Because of this 9 the Chairman of the Committee conferred 
1 with Executive Secretary Amelito R. Mutuc expressing the 



the Committee's doubt as to whether it should study the case, 
and make findings and recommendations, in view of the retire- 
ment of General Cabal, and Secretary Mutuc said that ho would 
study this legal aspect of the case. After about two weeks, 
the Chairman reminded Secretary Mutuc of the matter and the 
latter again assured hin: that this legal problem would be 
studied by Malacahang. Secretary Mutuc was appointed Ambas- 
sador to the United States and until now the Committee has 
not been informed of the result of said study of the case. 
Rather than keep the voluminous records of the investigation 
in the possession of the Chairman of the Committee, said 
chairman conferred with Secretary Juan S. Cancio of the 
Legal Office of Malacahang unu the latter said that it would 
be better for the records of the case to be kept in Malacahang 
and that offhand, he agreed with the Committee's view that 
any finding and recommendation of the Committee based on the 
investigation might dc academic. 

The Committee created by President Gurcia was an adminis- 
trative one; so was the investigation. According to Civil 
Service authorities, the primary object of adiaiaistx'utive 
disciplinary proceedings is to protect tae public service and 
to secure the faithful and efficient performance of official 
functions; thatremoval proceedings under oar Civil Service 
Law and rules are intended to riu the civil service of incom- 
petent and unworthy public servants so that the office may be 
filled and the functions thereof may be exercised by competent 
and honest officials. 

Examining the records of the AFP re General Cabal, Sec- 
retary of National befense Macario eraita, Jr. in a letter 
dated January 2, 1961, addressed to the President of the 
Philippines, recommended that Lt. Gen. Manuel F# Cabal be 
retired under the provisions of Republic Act No# 340, saying 
that he had served fot) 30 years of contiguous and satisfactory 
service, adding that the fact that there were pending charges 
against him under the Anti-Graft Law d;ould not be considered 
a bar to his retirement, and that furthermore, according to the 
opinion of the Secretary of Justice, the provisions of the 
Anti-Graft Lav/ were not applicable in the case of compulsory 
retirement. Secretary Peralta expressed the belief that it is 
to the ultimate interest of the service that Lt. Gen. Cabal 
should be retired rather than that he ahoult. bo allowed to 
continue in the service for what appears to be an uncertain 
period, all this despite a sort of memorandum entitled "Retire- 
ment, Tenure and Rank of the Chief of Staff, AFP" dated 
December 28, 19G1, from the office of J.A.G. signed by one 
Reyes, containing the following paragraph; 

"2. a. By a uniform policy established by the 
President, the retirement of an officer or an 
enlisted faan under the provisions of Republic Act 
No. 340, whether optional or compulsory, is subject 
to the condition that the officer or enlisted man 
concerned has 'no pending administrative or court- 
martial case*. Pursuant thereto, it is established 
administrative practice not to recommend to the 
President the retirement of an officer or enlisted 
man with a pending case. It cannot be reasonably 
expected that the President would deviate from 
this policy in the particular case of the Chief of 
Staff."

liy 1st Indorsement dated January 4, 1962, Executive Sec- 
retary Amelito K, Mutuc returned the letter of Secretary Peralta, 
approving, "as therein recommended, the retirement of Lt. Gen. 
Manuel F. Cabal ti-1416, AFP, from the active service of the 
Armed Forces of the Philippines, effective this date." 

The Presidential Committee has been duly informed thut 
General Cabal is, and has boon receiving his retirement pay. 

The main if not the only purpose of an administrative 
investigation of a public official is, if found guilty, to 
dismiss, remove, or suspend him. In the present case, General 
Cabal has not been dismissed nor removed from the service but 
was allowed to retire and was given retirement benefits, upon 
recommendation of the Secretary of National Defense because 
of his supposed long continuous and efficient service and 
approved by the President acting through Executive Secretary 
Mutuc . 



In the United States it has been held that in order to 
be removed from office, the official must not only have 
qualified but must be acting, and a proceeding for the removal 
of an officer cannot be maintained after he had ceased to hold 
his office. It has also Leon held that a proceeding for the 
removal of the officer under the pertinent provisions of a 
California law, could not bo maintained after said officer 
had ceased to hold office. 

It might bo argued that despite General Cabal’s retirement, 
the retirement pay as well as other benefits he is not, receiving 
might yet bo stopped or forfeited, however, such forfeiture is 
only accessory in nature. Unless the principal penalty of 
removal is imposed, the accessory penalty may not. be enforced. 

In the case of Bautista vs. Negado, et al, G.h. No. L-14319, 
May 26, 1960, the supreme £ourt said: 

"The principle is that when an officer or 
employee is disciplined, the object sought is 
not the punishment of 3uch officer or employee 
but the improvement of the public service and 
the preservation of the people’s faith and 
confidence in their Government ." (Bautista vs. 

Negado, et al,, G.K. No. L-14319, May 26, I960). 

o If the purpose of an administrative investigation is merely 
to deprive a public official of benefits accruing to him under 
the retirement laws and the forfeiture of the cash value of his 
leave credits, the object for which such official is disciplined 
would not be served for the reason tiiat the public service would 
not thereby be improved because there would be no need to remove 
an official already out of the service and such forfeiture und 
the benefits of the retirement law would be punishment and not 
in keeping with the ruling of the Supreme Court in the case 
abovecited. 

For the foregoing reasons, the members of the Presidential 
Committee have decided to forward the complete records of the 
investigation without any findings of fact, uuch less, recom- 
mendation. Further. -ore, anj' finding or recommend tion ££ the 
Committee assuming that the charges have been duly proven.

would not result in the forfeiture of the alleged unexplained 
wealth or the imposition upon him of a prison sentence. 

Under Republic Act No. 1379, forfeiture of unexplained 
wealth can only be obtained after a taxpayer has complaiued 
to the city or provincial fiscal who after iavesti b ution and 
inquiry finds that there is reasonable ground to believe that 
the respondent is probably guilty of having acquired unexplained 
wealth, and said fiscal should certify to that effect to the 
Solicitor General, and the Solicitor Gcncsal in the name of 
the Republic of the Philippines shall file in the corresponding 
Court of First Instance a petition for a writ commanding said 
officer or employee to show cause why the said unexplained 
property &oald not be declared forfeited. In othor words, 
only a Court of First Instance with the intervention of the 
city or provincial fiscal and the Solicitor General cun order 
said investigation. Any finding or recommendation of the 
Presidential Committee in the matter would be of little or nc 
value whatsoever. 

However, the records of the investigation form part of 
the public records, asccssible to any party, so if any person 
desires to avail himself thereof for purposes of prosecuting 
the respondent either criminally or for forfeiture of the 
alleged unexplained wulth, lie can do so. 

be ford concluding, it is our painful duty to inform Your 
Excellency that one of the members of our Cpmmittee Hon. 

Sotero Cubahug, died last year, and so can no longer take 
part in this disposition of the case. 

In view of the foregoing, thanking His Excellency for the 
confidence reposed and courtesies accorded to us by allowing 
us to continue the investigation, wo aoroby forward tho complete 
record of the case.

Dear Mr* President:
