My dear General: 

From today to the 19th the thoughts of the World, parti- 
cularly those of America and the Philippines, v.ill be focused 
to the Great MANUEL L. QUEZON. 

1 have collected the recorded utterances and writings of 
that beloved leader of men from 1904 to shortly before his de- 
mise in 1944, for a book under the title, "QUEZON IN ACTION," 
now ready for the press. 

While those utterances and writings sufficiently reveal 
his wisdom and teachings, yet it is felt that some other things 
or views about him worthy to be transmitted to us of this genera- 
tion and to those yet to come can only be told and recorded for 
posterity by men of your distinction who have had the privilege 
or opportunity of observing, knowing and/or associating or deal- 
ing with him. 

I have the honor, therefore, to request your good self if 
you could favor me with your eminent recollections of thet great 
patriot, MANUEL L. QUEZON, so that the same together with those 
from also prominent men then situated under similar circumstances 
can be inscribed in another book as a sequel to the one mentioned 
above, with the title, "IN DEATH HE LIVES" (Being Recollections 
of President Manuel L. Quezon). It is unfortunate that similar re- 
collections by such men as were the late President Manuel Roxas, 
the late Chief Justice Jose Abad Santos, the late Secretary Rafael 
Alunen and others cannot now be available. 

For tiie purpose of, and for inclusion in, the same book, I 
also have the honor to request you to kindly have me furnished 
likewise with a statement of your biography accompanied with your 
photograph preferably one, if available, with President Quezon. 

I wish to assure you, esteemed General, that it will be an 
hj&nor end a pleasure to receive from you the foregoing materials 
for which I shall be very much grateful. 

Very respectfully.
