MEMORANDUM : 

TO : Major General B a J. VALDES* Secretary of National Defense and 

Communication* Commonwealth of the Philippine Islands,* 

Further to our telephone conversation of today* it is suggested 
that a radio substantially similar to the attached be sent through General

U. S.* and eliminate delay there when the mail arrives,,

permitted.
