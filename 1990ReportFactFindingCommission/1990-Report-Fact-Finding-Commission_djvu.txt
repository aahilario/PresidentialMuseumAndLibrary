PREFACE 



In the wake of the failed coup of December 1989, President Corazon 
C. Aquino issued Administrative Order No 146 creating a Presidential 
Commission to conduct a fact-finding investigation of the 1989 rebellion 
and the involvement of military and civilian officials and private persons 
in it. Its members were Hilario G. Davide, Jr, a member of the 1986 
Constitutional Commission and incumbent Chairman ofthe Commission 
on Elections(COMELEC)asChairman;CarolinaG. Hernandez, Professor 
of Political Science and Director of the Center for Integrative and 
Development Studies ofthe University of the Philippines (UP-CIDS); 
Ricardo J. Romulo, a member ofthe 1986 Constitutional Commission, a 
practicing lawyer, and a business executive; Delfin L. Lazaro, a member 
ofthe UP Board of Regents, President of Benguet Corporation (Benguet 
Corp), and a 1985 TOYM awardee; and Msgr Leonardo Legaspi, 
Archbishop of the Diocese of Nueva Caceres and President of the 
Catholic Bishops Conference ofthe Philippines, as members. The first 
four took their oath of office on 7 December 1989. Msgr Legaspi declined 
the designation. In his place, President Aquino appointed Christian S. 
Monsod, also amember ofthe 1986 Constitutional Commission, National 
Co-Chairman of the Bishops-Businessmen's Conference for Human 
Development, a 1975 TOYM awardee, and a business executive, who 
took his oath of office on 28 December 1989. 

In its Special Session of 3 January 1990, Congress approved Republic 
Act No 6832 (RA No 6832) entitled An Act Creating a Commission To 
Conduct A Thorough Fact-finding Investigation Of The Failed Coup 
D'Etat Of December 1989, Recommend Measures To Prevent The 
Occurrence Of Similar Attempts At A Violent Seizure Of Power, And For 
Other Purposes. It was approved and signed by the President on 5 
January 1990, andit took effect on 12 January 1990. The new Commission, 
with much expanded powers, has since been known as the Fact-Finding 
Commission. President Aquino appointed to the new Commission the 
Chairman and the members of the Presidential Commission who then 
took their oath of office on 12 January 1990. Ahistory ofboth Commissions 
is found in Appendix A. 



Three Interim Reports had previously been submitted to the President 
and the Congress, namely 

1. Interim Report No 1 - Observation and Recommendations 

on Military Justice as Related to 
Coups, 16 July 1990, 

2. Interim Report No 2 - The Role of the Philippine Air Force 

in the Destruction of the Rebel Air 
Assets in Sangley Point, 16 July 
1990, and 

3. Interim Report No 3 - The Urgency of Legislation 

Implementing Military-Related 
Provisions ofthe 1987 Constitution, 
28 August 1990. 

The Report that follows is the Fact-Finding Commission's Final 
Report. It has seven chapters and 19 appendices. In order to provide a 
better understanding of the phenomenon of the coup d'etat, Chapter I 
describes it, analyzes its various elements, and discusses various 
hypotheses explaining why a coup d'etat occurs on the basis of other 
countries' experiences. Because a coup d'etat pertains primarily to the 
relationship between the government and the military organization, 
Chapter II describes political changes and military transformation in 
the Philippines prior to the failed coup of December 1989. Because a coup 
d'etat is primarily the handiwork of military officers and does not take 
place in a vacuum, Chapter III describes and analyzes the socialization 
process which the Filipino military officer undergoes to understand the 
possible reasons for his politicization, the domestic socio-economic- 
political environment in the country at the time of the failed coup, and 
the external linkages of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) 
which might have influenced its officers' orientations. It also provides 
some insights on the political orientations of purposively selected military 
units to determine their predisposition towards a coup d'etat. 

In Chapter IV, the Report discusses the various coup plots in which 
factions of the AFP had involved themselves from the failed coup of 
February 1986 against former President Ferdinand E. Marcos which 
was overtaken by the EDS A Revolt up to that of 28 August 1987 to show 
that there is a continuity of the main plots and the main coup plotters. 
Chapters V to VII contain the core of the Commission's findings as to the 
coup attempt itself; the main plotters; the causes, both alleged and real; 
the Commission's analysis, conclusions, and recommendations. The 



latter is not addressed solely to government because in the view of the 
Commission, events and developments in the country are a collective 
responsibility of all Filipinos. 

The Commission prays that its work will be responded to with the 
same commitment and sincerity in which it undertook this challenging 
task. We wish to thank President Aquino and Congress for having 
honored us with their trust and support, the various government 
agencies and instrumentalities which extended their unqualified 
assistance and cooperation, particularly the Develop-ment Bank of the 
Philippines which opened its Directors' wing to us undoubtedly bringing 
considerable inconvenience to itself, and private organizations, parti- 
cularly Benguet Corporation which responded to our urgent needs 
especially during the Commission's initial months in office. We also wish 
to thank each and every employee of the Commission without whose 
dedication our task would have been more difficult. 

This Final Report represents the labor of many hands; the insights, 
introspection, and experiences of hundreds of Filipinos; and the Commis- 
sion wants to believe, the patriotism and commitment to democracy by 
those who have worked and cooperated with it in the discharge of its 
task. Even as we have profited immensely from their participation, in 
the end the responsibility for the Report's errors and shortcomings rest 
solely and squarely on the Commission, particularly its Chairman and 
four members.

COUP D'ETAT : AN OVERVIEW 



The coup d'etat, or more appropriately, the coup attempt, as a 
politico-military event is a recent phenomenon in the Philippine political 
scene. The country experienced its first coup attempt only in February 
1986, when members of the Reform the Armed Forces of the Philippines 
Moveme it (RAM) tried to stage one against former President Ferdinand 
E. Marcos. That attempt failed when security forces loyal to President 
Marcos uncovered the plot. Subsequent events overtook that coup when 
the people staged the popular People Power Revolt at EDS A and success- 
fully ended Marcos' s rule. That popular revolt confirmed the election 
victory of and installed Corazon C. Aquino as the duly elected seventh 
President of the Republic of the Philippines. Barely into its fifth month 
of governance, the Aquino administration faced the first of seven coup 
attempts. 1 The most recent was the failed coup attempt of December 
1989 which the Fact-Finding Commission was tasked to investigate. 
Even as this Final Report was being written, wild rumors of a possible 
eighth coup attempt circulated as a spate of bombings upset the peace of 
metropolitan Manila and sowed fear among its people. 

In any event, the coup d'etat has become a hard fact of political life 
in the Philippines. Gone are the days of a military totally restricted to 
the barracks or guarding the borders of the State or building roads, 
bridges and rendering free basic medical and dental services. As will be 
shown in the succeeding chapters of this Report, notably Chapter II, the 
Philippine military over the years and particularly under the tutelage 
of Marcos, developed far beyond those traditional roles. 

Local scholarly studies on the subject of military intervention, 
specifically on coups d'etat, from which the Commission had hoped to 
draw some ideas for a framework of study, are still relatively few and 
inadequate. As a phenomenon, however, the coup d'etat has been a 



recurring experience that has haunted the majority of the states in 
Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa since the 1900s. In these 
countries, the rise of the military to prominence in the political arena 
became the obvious outcome of a successful coup. Figures with respect 
to the number of coup attempts, successful or otherwise, vary from one 
author to the other. One author counted a total of 311 attempted coups 
d'etat in some 79 different countries during the period 1945 to 1985, 170 
of which were successful, 2 at least initially. Put another way, these 
figures illustrate that "half of the sovereign states represented at the 
UnitedNationshave experienced an illegal or unconstitutional overthrow 
of their existing governments (democratically elected or not) at some 
point in their recent history." 3 

Clearly, in global terms, "independent political activity by the armed 
forces is . . . frequent, widespread and of long standing." 4 One author has 
noted that of the 51 states existing in or before 1917, all but 19 
experienced coups since 1917; of the 28 created between 1917 and 1955, 
all but 15 had a coup. 6 In subsequent years until 1980, 70 states 6 faced 
a total of 179 coups. 7 Thus, a total of 115 states all over the world 
experienced coups from early 1900 up to the end of the last decade. 

By the end of 1980, the total number of states governed by men 
installed into power by some form of military action numbered 37, 8 
"representing 25 percent of the world's 150 independent states and 
comprising some 55 percent of the population of Latin America, nearly 
two-thirds of the population of the Arab states of North Africa and the 
Middle East and a like proportion of the population of sub-Saharan 
Africa." 9 Notable in these so-called military regimes is the fact that two 
had chief executives who were civilians, namely: Uruguay, where the 
military chose to install a certain Dr Apriano Mendez in lieu of President 
Bordiguerry in 1976, and Iraq, where Saddam Hussein took over from 
Field Marshall Bakr. 10 

In 24 of the 37 aforementioned military regimes, executive power is 
vested in the military as an institution by way of a supreme military 
council. 11 There are neither parties nor legislatures in 15 of these 
regimes, while single official parties exist in the nine others. These 24 
states are said to be stratocracies or "closed bureaucratic regimes with 
the military in supreme control." 12 As for the other 13 military regimes, 
they are said to be either mixed civilian-military or wholly civilian, 
where there is military presence in the Cabinet or an all-civilian 
Cabinet, respectively, under the leadership of a civilian president 
installed through a coup. 



CHAPTER I 3 



A. The Phenomenon of the Coup (TEtat 
A.1. Coup cTEtat Defined 

A coup d'etat is a French word which is more or less synonymous to 
putsch in German and golpede estodom Spanish. It is a general term 
which describes a method of displacing a government or supplanting a 
regime through the use of military violence. 13 A coup d'etat is "a direct 
seizure of political control by members of the armed forces, who may be 
acting in concert with civilian allies." 14 

A coup d'etat is both a political act and a military action. 15 It is the 
product of a coalition of cliques and groups, usually including both 
military and civilian elements, who have been preparing for it for a 
considerable length of time. 16 In this period of preparation, various 
groups of political actors will have been sounded out and their support 
assured or their opposition neutralized. 

As a political act, it is an unlawful means of seizing power from the 
duly constituted government, 17 and employed by the military to replace 
the political incumbents with themselves or their nominees. 

As a military operation, the strategy is naturally of utmost 
importance. 18 Coup plotters need to consider the elements of secrecy, 
surprise, and the effective tactical neutralization of the possible military 
and civilian opposition. 

Generally, a coup is staged either by the entire armed forces or by 
a politicized group of military officers who ride on popular grievances 
among the officer corps against the civilian leadership. 19 Politicization 
is the process by which military personnel acquire and develop political 
awareness and inclination to assume functions beyond the sphere of 
activities normally pertaining to the military role of national defense. Its 
extreme form is when they use the arms and resources entrusted to them 
against the very people and the state they solemnly swore to defend and 
protect. Politicization can occur at the institutional, sectional, or 
individual level. 20 In the case of the Philippines, it never had the 
experience of a coup staged by the entire armed forces. Chapter IV will 
show that the series of coup attempts against the administration of 
President Aquino were staged by a highly politicized segment in the 
Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). 

A coup has six distinguishing features. One, it is the effort by a 
political coalition to illegally replace the existing governmental leaders 
through violence or the threat of it. 21 Two, the violence employed is 



4 



usually small. 22 Three, the participants already possess an institutional 
base of power within the political system. 23 Four, a coup does not 
necessarily need the participation of the masses, or, to a significant 
degree, the participation of the bulk of the armed forces. 24 Five, it does 
not openly profess any political line or ideology. 26 The purpose of this, 
presumably, is to avoid any form of opposition from any political forces. 
Six, it does not happen spontaneously. 26 

AJ2. Elements of a Coup 

There appears to be five essential elements of a coup, the most 
important of which are opportunity and motive. As a leading scholar on 
the military has pointed out, "to intervene the military must have both 
the occasion and the disposition." 27 The other elements are the military's 
capability to intervene, the strategy of the coup plot, and the leaders of 
the coup. 

A£.a. Coup Motives 

No military is likely to intervene in the political affairs of its country 
if in the first place it has no disposition to intervene. Disposition here 
refers to a combination of conscious motives and of a will or desire to act. 28 
Motive is a drivingforce behind men and women who are prepared to risk 
imprisonment and whatever consequences there may be, as a result of 
an unlawful pursuit of political power. 29 

Motives for military intervention are varied and complicated. No 
single factor can be easily pointed out as the sole cause for intervention. 
It is oftentimes a conjunction of motives which cause the military to 
intervene in domestic politics. Chapter VII deals with coup factors as 
they relate to the December 1989 failed coup attempt. 

The usual motives of the military for intervention are the "national 
interests as perceived and defined by the officer corps, middle-class 
interests with which the military generally identifies, institutional or 
corporate interests of the armed forces, regionalistic, ethnic or parti- 
cularistic interests, and person al interests of some military coup plotters. 30 
These motives are discussed in the subsequent sections of this chapter 
under factors affecting military intervention. 

A^.b. Coup Opportunity 

Opportunity refers to the precise occasion of launching a coup. It is 
the product of some kind of rational calculation before the coup is 



CHAPTER I 5 



staged. 31 It includes the presence of necessary conditions for a successful 
coup. These conditions can either be created or, if they exist naturally, 
exploited to the advantage of the coup. 32 

The conditions which engender opportunities for mutinous military 
to intervene 33 are war time, when there is civilian dependence on the 
military, an overt domestic crisis like a civil war, a latent or chronic crisis 
like a continuing insurgency or prolonged economic distress, and a 
vacuum in national leadership. Under these conditions, the military is 
more likely to play a major and highly visible role. Discussion of these 
conditions in general, is done in the latter part of this chapter, and with 
respect to the December 1989 coup attempt in particular, in Chapter III. 

A^.c, Capability for Military Intervention 

The armed forces have three decidedly overwhelming political 
advantages over civilian organizations: a marked superiority in orga- 
nization, highly emotionalized symbols, and a monopoly of the instruments 
for legal violence. 34 These three elements constitute the political strengths 
of the military, and underscore its capability for intervention in politics. 
In addition, the military has certain distinct organizational characteristics 
which make it behave like a machine. These characteristics are dis- 
cussed in Section B.l.a. 

The highly emotionalized symbols generate political strength. The 
military exacts observance in its rituals and traditions. The newcomers 
or recruits are indoctrinated to respect the insignia, merit medals, 
banners, colors, and other physical manifestations of military traditions 
and rituals. As these traditions are indoctrinated to inculcate a sense of 
"service to the nation" among soldiers, they become the symbols of their 
patriotic deeds and ideals. These symbols oftentimes give the military 
an idea that everything it does is for the interest of the nation. These also 
tend to enhance military cohesi^eness and camaraderie. Thus, in instances 
where soldiers are caught in conflict with other soldiers, they invoke 
camaraderie in settling the conflict. 

But the most formidable strength of the military which underscores 
its capability for intervention is its monopoly of the instruments for legal 
violence. In instances of conflicts and disagreements, the threat or the 
use of force may determine the outcome. 



A.2.d. Coup Strategy 



The degree of success of a coup is sometimes measured on the basis 
of the extent of bloodshed. One author claims that "the more bloodless 
a coup, the more successful it is." 35 Other scholars measure its degree 
of success by the number of hours or days that lapsed before the coup 
leaders took full control of the government. In effect, the least time spent 
in seizing government control, the more successful a coup. The real 
barometer of success ultimately lies in the effective capture of political , 
power by the coup plotters. 

Basically, the three prerequisites for success of a coup are secrecy, 
surprise, and the neutralization in various ways of the bulk of the armed 
forces. 36 

To preserve secrecy, the coup conspirators do not seek the complicity 
of the entire armed forces. 37 The ideal size of the coup conspirators is just 
large enough to be able to undertake the simultaneous seizure of all 
crucial targets which include infantry and armored assets, military 
aircraft, power centers, and all types of communication installations. 

The element of surprise is observed by the execution of the coup with 
optimum speed and coordination. Any error in terms of coordination and 
miscalculation in speed may allow the government to consolidate its 
forces and mount resistance to the coup forces. 

The element of neutralization includes not only neutralizing the 
police and the military who are not part of the coup plot, but also the 
various political forces. These political forces such as political parties, 
non-government organizations, sectional interests, regional, ethnic and 
religious groupings, may also protect the government against the coup. 

In the context of a coup, neutralization does not necessarily mean the 
annihilation of its opponents but the imposition of a condition of temporary 
impotence. 33 Hence, to effectively neutralize the political forces, two . 
rules are usually observed by the coup plotters. First, the coup propa- 
gandists generally exploit issues that do not antagonize or at least 
minimize opposition from political forces. Second, maximum speed is 
observed to temporarily force these political forces who will be caught by 
surprise into passivity. A delay in the carrying out of the coup plot may 
allow these political forces to consolidate and organize collective opposition 
to it. 



7 



On the other hand, the neutralization of the bulk of the armed forces 
may well depend on the crucial targets seized. Communication channels 
are considered of critical importance for the propaganda and psychological 
warfare of the coup leaders. Air force assets and armored tanks, if 
effectively seized, can neutralize the movements of other military forces 
who are not part of the coup plot. Influential military officers are 
considered crucial targets for their potentiaj in resisting a coup. To 
neutralize these officers, they should be seized either in order of 
importance or simultaneously. 39 

The nature and quality of recruitment of the military coup supporters 
and the timing of the day the coup is to be carried out are also crucial 
factors which may determine the outcome of the coup. 

The nature of recruitment may pose a risk to the coup in terms of 
secrecy and security. Any individual targeted to be recruited may either 
be a supporter of the coup or an informer of the enemies of the coup. To 
avert any possibility of recruiting an informer, the three considerations 
which are usually observed by coup recruiters are links of friendship or 
camaraderie with the planners of the coup, shared political beliefs and 
convictions, and family, ethnic and clan links with those planning the 
coup. 40 Furthermore, the nature of the recruitment may take the form of 
any of the following: senior military coup plotters will deceive their men 
as to what exactly they are going to do; appeal their causes to them by 
citing anomalies and misconduct of some government officials; or, they 
would simply threaten them. 

The quality of recruits has also often been underscored. The plotters 
usually recruit the active participation of strategically situated middle- 
level troop commanders — officers who command infantry or armor 
battalions stationed in or near the capital city. They also recruit pilots 
of helicopter gunships or other air assets. The credibility of recruited 
officers is an important factor in convincing others to support or counter 
the coup. 

The timing of the coup is critical to its success. For instance, at a time 
when the military security measures against coup plotshave become lax, 
coup leaders have the strategic advantage. The coup also has the 
advantage when it is launched at a time when there is a serious political 
issue that ignites widespread criticism of the government. 41 

AJ2.e. Coup Leaders 

A coup is staged by a group of politicized military officers who ride 



8 



on popular grievances against the civilian government. But because 
they are able to exploit certain military and national issues, the coup 
plotters secure sympathy and support from some idealist military 
officers. These politicized military officers, who usually are not at the 
helm of military authority and command, are, as in most cases, driven 
by personal reasons. The idealist officers, on the other hand, believe that 
whatever they do are in $ie best interest of the nation. 

Aside from politicized military officers, coup conspirators would also 
often include civilian individuals. The coup-related experiences of many 
Latin American countries reveal that some civilian politicians, mostly 
belonging to the opposition parties, also lent "support" to military coup 
plotters, or had directly participated in the coup. Military coup leaders 
listen to the advice of these politicians, count on them for assistance in 
justifying the coup before public opinion, and solicit their support in 
running the country if the coup succeeds. 42 

Politicalized military officers are usually composed of middle-ranking 
officers from the level of captain to lieutenant colonels who do not yet 
participate extensively in the usual channels of decision -making, and 
others who hold grievances against top military officers and/or political 
leaders. 43 These officers are noted to be more effective in seeking the 
obedience of their subordinates because of the fact that they exercise the 
most direct authority over the latter. 

It has been noted that the advantage of middle-ranking officers over 
their senior commanders in seeking the obedience of their soldiers is 
more pronounced once the military is highly politicalized. 44 In such 
conditions, these officers attain considerable independence such that 
their senior commanders usually cannot force them to counter or support 
a coup. 

B. Theoretical Explanations for the Occurrence 
of Coup d' Etat 

The frequency of military seizures of power through coup d'etat all 
over the world has spawned many divergent interpretations concerning 
their causes. From among these views, there appear two general 
perspectives which seem to encapsulize factors affecting the occurrence 
of a coup. The first comes from those social scientists who theorize that 
factors attributable to the military organization are the significant 
causes of a coup. The second perspective comes from those who believe 
that societal factors which are external to the military more directly 



CHAPTER I 9 



affect the likelihood of a coup d'etat than do the organizational attributes 
of the military. 

Some scholars have warned, however, that internal or societal 
factors should not be emphasized to the exclusion of the other. This 
warning seems to have enough merit, as the experiences of many Third 
World countries consistently show an interplay of these factors. 
Conversely, no single factor, whether societal or attributable to the 
military organization, can be claimed as the sole cause for the occurrence 
of a coup. 

In view of this, we have here divided the theories explaining the coup 
into (1) those attributable to the military organization, and (2) those 
external to the military. A third, the "contagion" theory 46 is discussed 
separately. 

B.l. Theories Attributing Coup Causes to Factors 
Internal to the Military Organization 

The military has basic attributes which can be transformed into 
formidable political strengths against any civilian political force, including 
the civilian leadership. These military attributes include certain 
characteristics inherent in the military organization, the mission and 
role perception of the members of the armed forces, and certain military 
variables affecting the integrity and self-image of the soldiers. 

B.l.a. Organizational Characteristics 

* 

The armed forces has certain inherent organizational features 
which are believed to be essential in the pursuit of the accomplishment 
of the military's traditional mission of protecting the country from any 
form of foreign aggression. These organizational features are centralized 
command, military discipline, hierarchy, formalized internal commu- 
nication, esprit de corps, and the possession of the means for the 
legitimate use of violence. 46 



The centralization nf MMmfflnri in the entire armed forces is a 
purposive creation because only through it can the military act as a 
single unit and hence, achieve its mission with a high degree of efficiency. 
This centralized command is evident in the observance of the military 
chain of command where the lowest or most junior officer is linked to the 
highest commanding officer in the military. 



10 



The h jfiiaifihkal order of the military organization is also observed 
as enabling the entire armed forces to act as a single fighting unit. An 
officer of certain military rank is obliged to render explicit obedience to 
any officer who has a higher rank. 

All members of the armed forces, from the highest to the lowest 
ranking official, are subject to military discinline. Any violation of, or 
deviation from, military standard functions has its corresponding 
punishment in the military. Since the military chain of command is 
considered as sacrosanct in the organization, and the entire military is 
oriented to act as a single body, military discipline is oftentimes meant 
as absolute obedience to the orders of superior officers. This particular 
trait among many military men prompted numerous scholars to liken 
the military to a machine which normally behaves in a fairly predictable 
manner. 47 

Internal com muni cation in the military, such as signal systems and 
military codes, is also an essential factor in effectively carrying out its 
functions. Coordination and precision in military operations are greatly 
enhanced by this internal communication system which is independent 
of civil authorities. 

A distinct characteristic that the military possesses as formidable 
is its monopoly of the instruments for legal violence . By virtue of its 
mission , the military alone is given the legal authority to carry, maintain, 
and use arms and weapons. 

However, these characteristics of the military organization can 
effectively work against the very government which maintains it. This 
is particularly true in Third World countries, where the military has 
been assigned another role, that of maintaining internal peace and 
order. In these countries, the distinctive organizational features of the 
military can strongly affect its propensity to intervene in the political 
affairs of the nation. 4 * The machine-like nature of the military, for 
instance, has often been exploited during coups d'etat. 

B.l.b. Mission and Role Perception of the Military 

In many developed states in the West, the traditional mission of the 
military has been the protection of the state against foreign military 
aggression. The external security of the nation has been its sole 
responsibility. In Third World states, however, the mission of the 
military has been expanded to include internal security, that is, the 
maintenance of peace and order threatened by internal insurgencies. In 



CHAPTER I 11 



these countries, the involvement of the military in internal pacification 
inherently arid inevitably brings it into political disputes. 49 In fact, it has 
often been hypothesized that the likelihood of military intervention 
in the political affairs of the nation rises should the armed forces 
become heavily involved in domestic, police-type, or counter-insurgency 
activities 50 . Furthermore, military interference is likely to occur when 
the armed forces are ordered, contrary to the advice of the officer corps, 
to use coercion against domestic opponents of the government, or to 
enforce unpopular governmental decisions. 61 The military's neutrality 
and subordination to the civilian government are strained because the 
military becomes not the defender of the state but an instrument of its 
political leadership. 

Also, in Third World nations, the military has often been used by its 
government as an arm in national development efforts. Governments 
of these countries believe that in the absence of actual external threat, 
the military organization, its efficiency, and manpower* can become a 
formidable support in nation-building. Social scientists have theorized 
that as civic action projects absorb the attention and expertise of the 
military, these programs lessen the likelihood of military intervention. 52 
The military becomes too preoccupied with these programs that it does 
not have the time to plot against the government. On the other hand, 
there are officers who feel it is not their duty to get involved in some types 
of development programs. 

The possibility of military intervention may also arise when military 
officers alter their mission — when they think of the military as the 
ultimate custodian of national interests. They then consider it their 
duty to arbitrate the political disputes or veto decisions of civilian 
authorities. 53 This was the experience of Thailand, Nigeria, Peru, Egypt, 
and many Latin American countries, where coups were mounted by 
officers who viewed their responsibility as guardians of the state. 54 

In essence, it is not the mission that pushes the military to intervene. 
Rather, it is how the officer corps defines and interprets the mission of 
the armed forces which may give rise to the phenomenon of military 
interference in the political arena. 

B.l.c. Military Variables 

Military variables are certain characteristics which vary from one 
soldier to another, from one service command to another, or such 
characteristics which may differentiate the entire armed forces of a 



12 



country from the military of another country. The variability of these 
characteristics, that is, whether they are high or low in degree in a 
particular military, may directly or indirectly affect the propensity of the 
military to intervene in or abstain from the political affairs of the nation. 
Military variables include military cohesion or the unity of military 
personnel, professionalism, autonomy on certain military policy matters, 
corporate interests, the level of political awareness of the officer corps 
and the extent of foreign military assistance. 

B.l.c.i. Cohesion 

The degree of cohesion or unity among military personnel, whether 
it is high or low, may pose a threat to the civilian government. A military 
with a high degree of cohesion has a greater capacity to intervene in 
domestic politics. 55 On the other hand, a successful coup by a military 
with a low degree of cohesion is likely to experience countercoups from 
other groups within the military. This is validated by studies of 
numerous coups in self-divided militaries of Syria, Iraq, Ecuador, Bolivia, 
and Argentina. 56 

It should be noted, however, that the military, or a faction in it, does 
not intervene or attempt to seize political leadership by reason of 
military cohesion alone. Besides, cohesion is not a reason for staging a 
coup. Rather, it is a factor which helps promote the success or likelihood 
of a coup, or of a countercoup. At most, it is contributory to such 
occurrence. 

B.l.c.ii. Professionalism 

Military professionalism exists when "the conduct of warfare is 
given over to men who have committed themselves to a career of service, 
men who are recognized for their expertise in the means of warfare." 87 
Three of its essential ingredients are expertise, social responsibility, and 
corporateness. 58 Military men are technicians in the management of 
legal violence. They feel a deep sense of responsibility to their client, th$ 
state, which may be seen in basic military codes like "duty, honor,; 
country " 59 They have their own powerful corporate tradition and^ 
organization. 

Many claim that professionalism in the army is the most decisive 
factor in keeping the military out of politics. However, there were cases 
where armed forces with high levels of professionalism became involved 
in the seizure of political power 60 such as the German and Japanese 



CHAPTER I 13 



cases. Also, the Royal Thai military was relatively high in terms of 
professionalism but nonetheless, it staged a coup in November 197 1. 61 

Consequently, some scholars were prompted to include a fourth 
requisite to military professionalism — adherence to the principle of 
supremacy of civilian authority over the military at all times. One 
author even claims that the willingness of the military to submit to 
civilian authority is a very crucial element of military professionalism. 62 
Another scholar says that respect for the chain of command is a 
characteristic of military professionalism. 63 By this definition, armed 
forces with a high degree of professionalism would not intervene in 
domestic politics. 

B.l.c.iii. Autonomy 

Military institutions always claim the right to exercise autonomy 
in their internal organization and operations. The sphere of military 
autonomy includes strategy, tactics, logistics, assignment, and promotion 
of its men. 64 This issue of military autonomy should be dealt with care 
and understanding by the civilian leadership because the military is 
very jealous of its corporate status and privileges. In fact, anxiety to 
preserve its autonomy is one of the most powerful motives for military 
intervention. 66 

A high degree of autonomy may place the military in an aggressive 
position. It can lead the military to consider itself as the ultimate judge 
on all matters affecting the armed forces, in which case, it can place the 
civilian leadership in constant threat of military intervention. 66 On the 
other hand, a low degree of autonomy may put the military in a defensive 
position where it may consider certain policy decisions of the govern- 
ment affecting it as interference in its internal affairs. Abrupt shifts in 
policies, particularly alterations perceived to threaten its corporate 
interests, prerogatives, and values may cause tensions in civil-military 
relations. Thus, changes or intentions to alter the military areas of 
decision-making against its advice or desires are likely to encourage 
military intervention 67 

B.l.c.iv. Corporate Interest 

The military is a corporate body with corporate interests. 68 As used 
here, "corporate" does not refer to a juridical personality, but to a distinct 
collective body with rules, interests, and traditions especially peculiar to 
the group. 



14 



Operationally, this corporate interest reflects itself in demands for 
bieeer budgets, better pay, adequate equipment, and other material 
resources, in intense opposition to the creation of any rival armed forces 
like workers 1 militia or presidential guards, and in a determination to 
have a say in public policy-making. 69 The last is particularly marked 
among militaries which have not fought a war for a long time, and are 
unlikely to do so in the immediate future. Such militaries actively search 
for a new role, and find it in a claim to participate in the development of 
the nation such as in the cases of the Central African Republic in 1966 
and Algeria in 1965. 70 

When a government fails to cater to corporate interests of the 
military, officers will be more inclined to intervene. While it is not always 
an immediate cause of intervention, government neglect of the military 
contributes to a general sense of alienation. 71 Military intervention in 
Indonesia in the mid-1950s and in Thailand in 1976 took place against 
such a background. 

B.l.c.v. Political Awareness 

Political awareness is the level of understanding of an individual of 
the different issues in society, and the self-assessment of this individual's 
capability to address or contribute to the solution of these issues. The 
political awareness of the soldier is greatly affected by the socio- 
economic-political conditions of the area where he is assigned. This is 
especially true among Third World countries where the role of the mili- 
tary has been expanded to include security from internal subversion. In 
these countries, the soldier finds himself directly immersed with the 
civilian populace, and is thus exposed to their daily problems. Political 
awareness might lead him to question why he fights his fellow citizens. 

The content' of military education and training may also affect the 
political awareness of the soldiers, especially the officer corps. A military 
education that includes political issues traditionally resolved by politicians 
would tend to increase the likelihood of military intervention. 72 Education 
and training patterned after or influenced by Western models give 
military personnel a developmental perspective where they see them- 
selves as agents of modernization. 73 They begin to believe that moderniza- 
tion is part of their mission. 

One author has provided two reasons for this modern outlook among 
soldiers. 74 First, officers, especially in the militaries of Third World 
states, look outside for their models, and are therefore extremely 
sensitive to the needs of modernization and technical advancement. 



CHAPTER I 15 



Second, militaries are rival institutions. The primary task of the 
military is to fight wars, and therefore it always wants to be better 
equipped than the armies of other countries, particularly neighboring 
ones. 

The perception of the military as a modernization catalyst has 
political consequences for the nation. In fact, in Third World countries, 
a military with a high level of political awareness that sees itself as an 
agent of modernization, is more likely to interfere in political affairs. 
Military domination of the government may, it is argued, have beneficial 
effects on the economy and improve the prospects of social reform. This 
appears to have been the experience in Turkey with a military that was 
modernized by a colonial administration ahead of other sectors. However, 
this may not be the rule. The extent to which the military becomes an 
agent of modernization depends on the level of its modernization relative 
to the other sectors of society. Officers who hold a modern outlook are 
usually a minority in the armed forces. 75 

A noted scholar on the military has claimed that in terms of 
modernization, the role of the military changes as society changes. 76 In 
an oligarchical society, the soldier is a radical; in a middle-class dominated 
society, he is a participant and arbiter; an d in a mass society, he becomes 
the conservative guardian of the existing order. 77 Understandably, the 
more backward a society, the more progressive its military; the more 
advanced a society, the more conservative and reactionary its military. 

In the Middle East after World War II, the soldiers played a 
modernizing role after seizing power in Syria in 1949, in Egypt in 1952, 
and in Iraq in 1958. 78 In Brazil and Argentina in the 1950s, however, and 
then in Bolivia, Guatemala, and Honduras in the 1960s, the military 
played a more conservative role. 

A high level of political awareness among soldiers has often been 
pointed out as a cause "for military intervention in politics. On the 
surface, it would seem that a high degree of political awareness works 
against the government and in favor of coup plotters. On closer look, 
however, a distinction should be made. High ranking officers with a high 
degree of political awareness may work within the system because they 
have enough influence to achieve their goals. 79 Junior and middle- 
ranking officers with limited access to and influence on the policy- 
nwVing process are the ones very much vulnerable to the idea of military 
intervention. In fact, coup plots have more often been initiated by 
middle-ranking officers. 80

B.l.c.vi. Foreign Military Assistance 

Foreign military assistance, in the form of military training, 
scholarships abroad, and transfer of military technology, affects the self- 
image of the military. This may lead the military to view itself as the 
most modern sector in society and may tempt it to aspire for a broader 
political role. 81 On the other hand, it can be a source of frustration, given 
the governments inability to provide them with resources comparable to 
their foreign peers. It is also a source of demoralization when the 
benefits of foreign assistance, particularly training abroad, are perceived 
to be unfairly distributed. 

B.2. Theories Attributing Coup Causes to Factors 
External to the Military Organization 

As noted above, certain societal factors tend to encourage a coup 
d'etat Some scholars contend that external factors particularly those 
attributable to the government, affect the occurrence of a coup more 
directly than factors internal to the military. One author, stressing the 
greater significance of societal factors, even claims that "there are no bad 
soldiers, only bad governments." 82 This view of singularly attributing 
all causes to the government overlooked relevant lessons from other 
countries. As discussed in this chapter, no single factor may be claimed 
as the sole cause of a coup, rather, it is an interplay of organizational and 
societal factors. 

B.2.a. Political Factors 

A noted scholar on the military has pointed out that "the most 
important causes of military intervention in politics are not military, but 
political and reflect not the social and organizational characteristics of 
the military establishment but the political and institutional structure 
of the society." 83 When political institutions are weak and fragmented 
that no group or political faction exercises clear control and leadership, 
the military usually intervenes. The military mind abhors a vacuum of 
leadership and feels impelled to fill it. Where such a vacuum exists and 
there are no "legitimate and authoritative methods for reconciling 
conflicts," 84 a praetorian society emerges. In such a polity, the coercive 
power of the military enables it to come out on top. Quoting Thomas 
Hobbes, one author points out that "when nothing else is turned up, 
clubs are trumps." 86 



Indeed, the military had often argued that they only intervene when 
civilian governments are unable to govern effectively. A failure of 



CHAPTER I 17 



governance and consequent political instability may lead to a perceived 
loss of legitimacy providing coup plotters with both the opportunity and 
motive for intervention. The coups in South Vietnam in 1963, in Laos in 
1959 and 1960, in Burma in 1958, and in Thailand in 1976, all occurred 
after the civilian governments were perceived to have failed. 86 

The perceived failure of a government to govern effectively is, 
however, not the only political factor which may affect the military's 
attitude to intervene. Other political factors are the historical origins of 
the military, its level of politicization, government policies affecting the 
military, influence of the political Left, the popularity of the armed 
forces, and superpower interest as an international factor. 

B.2.b. Economic Factors 

In most Third World countries, a coup has been consistently preceded 
by a deep crisis or deterioration in the economic conditions of the people 
in general. It is not established, however, that a deep economic crisis 
would always trigger a coup. What is apparent is that the likelihood of 
military intervention rises when there is a perceived deterioration of 
economic conditions, especially if accompanied by a belief that the 
government cannot resolve, or is responsible for, such deterioration. 87 
The experiences of Latin American countries and many African states 
tend to validate this claim. 

When the economic crisis becomes acute, the country usually 
experiences high inflation, in creasing unemployment and poverty, among 
others. These conditions create a restive atmosphere among labor 
unions, farmers, public utility drivers, students, and other political 
forces. These usually constitute the preconditions of a coup. In Indo- 
nesia, the failure of the "guided democracy" under President Sukarno to 
ensure a stable government and economic growth became one of the 
factors which caused the 1965 coup. In the abortive coup in Thailand in 
September 1985, economic issues were advanced as the main justifi- 
cation. 88 Such was the case also of Argentina, where economic growth 
and stability was cited as the military's justification for the coups in 1966 
and 1976. 89 The military is also provided powerful motives by the 
business community to intervene in domestic politics. When political 
tensions rise because of unfavorable economic developments, the business 
community often looks to the military as the only dependable domestic 
ally capable of protecting their investments and preserving an envi- 
ronment favorable to economic progress. Thus, private investors curry 
favor with military leaders while foreign capitalist governments provide 
not only economic aid but also military assistance. 90 



18 



B.2.C, Socio-Cultural Factors 

Military officers tend to share the broader interests of the middle 
class as a whole and to reflect the grievances of that class. 91 Although 
military officers do not always have middle-class origins, their status as 
officers puts them into that class. They also usually many into middle- 
class families. A government which fails to satisfy middle-class interests 
can thus often expect to face opposition not only from the middle class in 
general but from the officer corps of the military in particular. In fact, 
coups have often taken place after civilian governments have failed to 
meet the expectations of the educated urban middle class, especially its 
demand for economic progress. 92 Some examples of military intervention 
initially welcomed by the middle class were those in Indonesia in 1965- 
66, in Kampuchea in 1970, and in Thailand in 1976-77. 

Since soldiers are members of society, they have their own social and 
cultural characteristics which may be different and distinct from other 
social or cultural aggrupations. In times where social conflicts become 
intense and numerous, the soldiers can in no way be spared. Sometimes, 
individual elements in the military even become vocal partisans in such 
issues as ethnic tensions, class divisions, regional differences, and 
cleavages based on education, language, or religion. 93 When a point is 
reached where violence is resorted to by any of the contending civilian 
groups, military intervention is very likely to take place. 94 

B.2.d. Psychological and Personal Factors 

In general, there are four psychological factors which tend to 
encourage military intervention in domestic politics. These are the 
military's self-awareness of its overwhelming power or capacity to 
intervene, heroic complex which may take concealment in some messianic 
idealistic mission, morbid obsession with power, and a sense of frustration 
among soldiers on certain matters affecting the military. 

The military's self-awareness of its overwhelming capacity to 
intervene 96 can be attributed to the characteristics which the military 
organization has. This factor alone does not lead to military intervention 
in politics. 

The mission and training of the soldiers usually promote an intense 
kind of nationalism which turns into a display of military heroism. 
Military medals are not merely decorative. They carry a message of 
heroism — the more bemedalled an officer, the more heroic he appears 
amonghis peers. This tendency towards a heroic complex becomesmore 



CHAPTER I 19 



pronounced when they are politicized because they picture themselves 
as puritanically clean, honest, and sincere in their service to the nation, 
while perceiving the civilian political leaders as the opposite. Such 
officers assume a messianic mission to save the nation from the 
machinations of certain political leaders. 

A sense of frustration among soldiers, on the other hand, may arise 
when the self-esteem of the military has been gravely affected, or when 
it suffers humiliation on certain issues. Such was the case of Egypt when 
the pride of the army was gravely wounded and which led to military 
action in 1948. 96 In an extreme case, any kind of imagined affront to its 
pride may spark military intervention. 97 An illustrative case is the 1943 
coup in Argentina where the military displayed contempt for civilian 
authority. The Argentine military felt "vicarious shame" over the 
corruption in government, the country's dependence on the United 
States and the ill-equipped status of the army. The rebel officers felt 
that because of all these, the army lost face. 98 

Frustration among soldiers can also be attributed to the idealism 
among officers, especially among the junior level, and a defective 
promotion system. One author has claimed that some military men who 
intervened were motivated by high ideals of public service. 99 During the 
1960s and 1970s, for instance, Latin American officers were not only 
more ambitious for themselves and their nation, but were also more 
frustrated by repeated economic deterioration and instability. 100 The 
promotion system is particularly sensitive to the military because of its 
hierarchical structure and the extreme difficulty of recovering lost 
seniority. Military officers who find peers whom they believe are inferior 
beingpromoted ahead of them are vulnerable to recruitment. They may 
look to military adventurism as a form of protest or restitution. 

There are also personal factors which may prompt soldiers to rebel 
against the government. Among them is their desire to improve their 
military career, benefits, and privileges, believing that when the coup 
succeeds they would receive these improvements. Another is personal 
grievances against certain leaders in the military or in the government. 
In Argentina, Bolivia, and a number of African countries, some officers 
participated in coups due to personal factors. 

B.3. The "Contagion" Theory 

The "contagion" theory states that a successful coup breeds other 
coups, either in the same government or in neighboring states. From the 



20 



definition, it is obvious that the coup may occur either at the inter- 
governmental or the intra-military levels. 

The "contagion" theory claims that a successful seizure of political 
control in a country may cause a chain reaction in other nations with a 
similarly dissatisfied military. 101 The occurrence of a coup at the inter- 
governmental level is influenced by at least two factors: 102 the personal 
links among military officers in different countries that have coup 
experiences, and the extent of interstate ties. This was the experience 
of many African states. 

The "contagion" theory also claims that the military is not a monolithic 
unit, but is divided by political allegiance, sectional interest, generational 
gap, ethnic composition, inter-seivice rivalry, religion, and recruitment 
source. In a coup at the intra-military level, the success of one faction 
in staging a coup may prompt other factions in the military to counter or 
emulate those who have succeeded in seizing power. The numerous 
coups in self-divided armies of Iraq, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Argentina 
clearly demonstrate this. 

In succeeding chapters, we will discuss how the virus of military 
interventionism infected the AFP.

II 

POLITICAL CHANGE AND MILITARY 
TRANSFORMATION IN THE PHILIPPINES, 1966 - 1989: 
FROM THE BARRACKS TO THE CORRIDORS OF POWER 



This chapter examines the factors, both external and internal, 
which influenced the politicization of the Philippine military and pre- 
disposed it to the launching of coups. 

Traditionally, the military establishment is an organization whose 
sole function is to provide external defense. An extension of that function 
is internal security, or defense against aggression from within (internal 
subversion). In many Third World countries, however, the military has 
had to assume another role — that of maintaining peace and order. T> e 
Philippines is no exception to this phenomenon. 

A. Historical Development of the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines 

When the American Military Commander of the Philippines — upon 
instructions from the President of the United States of America on 4 July 
1901 —turned over the government to civilian authorities, the Philippine- 
American War (1898 - 1902) had not yet ended. To meet this situation, 
the Governor General ordered the formation of an Insular Police Force 
on 8 August 1901 under Capt Henry Allen. Initially, 74 American 
officers were appointed to man it. By 31 December 1901, the number 
grew to 180. To reinforce the American officers, Filipinos, deliberately 
selected from various ethnic groups, were organized as scouts. In 1905, 
a three-month course was offered at the Sta Lucia barracks in Intramuros 
for Filipino recruits to be trained as officers in the Insular Police Force. 
In 1917, the Revised Administrative Code changed the name of the 
Insular Police Force to the Philippine Constabulary, tasked mainly to 
provide internal security. 1 External security was provided by the US. 

On 15 November 1935, the Philippine Commonwealth was formally 
inaugurated. It was a creation of the American government which 



28 



retained control over Philippine affairs while grantinga certain measure 
of autonomy to Filipinos. 

A.1. The National Defense Act 

In his inaugural address, President Manuel Quezon stressed the 
urgent need to formulate an adequate defense program for the Philippines. 
Since the Commonwealth period would last for 10 years, a military 
institution would be needed to protect the state. Besides, Japan's 
aggressive policies indicated its intention to establish a sphere of 
influence in the area which in all certainty would include the Philippines. 2 
Quezon requested the services of Gen Douglas Mac Arthur as Military 
Adviser to assist in the development of the Philippine military. 

MacArthur formulated the National Defense Plan. As he envisioned 
it, the Philippine military establishment would primarily be a "citizen 
army with two main components: the Regular and Reserve Forces. The 
Regular Force wouldbe "made up of individuals who follow the profession 
of arms as a career, and who were constantly in the service of the govern- 
ment. The Reserve Force would consist of those able-bodied male 
citizens between the ages of 21 and 50 who have been duly trained for 
the military." 3 For MacArthur, the development of a reasonably adequate 
defense was important for the Filipinos and the Americans . American 
pride and prestige would suffer a severe blow should the Philippines ever 
fall under the control of another foreign power. 4 

Commonwealth Act No. 1, otherwise known as the National Defense 
Act, approved on 21 December 1935, authorized the organization of the 
Philippine Army. It was tasked to protect the state against external 
attack, to promote internal security, and to maintain peace and order. 6 

On 11 January 1936, to implement the National Defense Act, 
Quezon issued Executive Order No. 11 formally establishing the 
Philippine Army. The Philippine Constabulary, which arose out of the 
Insular Police Force, became the nucleus of the regular force of the 
Philippine Army. 

The Philippine Constabulary Air Group which was activated on 2 
January 1935, was redesignated as the Philippine Air Force on 3 July 
1947. In 1939, an Off-Shore Patrol (OSP) was organized as a unit of the 
Philippine Army. It was often referred to as the "mosquito fleet." In 
October 1947, the OSP was renamed Philippine Naval Patrol and on 5 
January 1951, it became the Philippine Navy. On 23 December 1950, 
President Elpidio Quirino issued Executive Order No. 389 designating 



UHAFTUK II 



the four major services to compose the Armed Forces of the Philippines 
(AFP). The Philippine Army (PA) became responsible for land defense, 
the Philippine Air Force (PAF) for air, the Philippine Navy (PN) for sea, 
and the Philippine Constabulary (PC) which, as the national police, was 
responsible for the security of rear areas in case of emergency. 6 Providing 
the command over the major services was General Headquarters, Armed 
Forces of the Philippines (GHQ, AFP). The Commander of the AFP was 
known as the Chief of Staff, AFP (CSAFP), who reported to the President 
as Commander-in-Chief. 

A2. US Role in the Formation of the AFP 

American participation in the formation of the AFP was clear from 
the start, with MacArthur as Military Adviser to Quezon formulating 
and implementing the first National Defense Plan. The US defined and 
shaped the functions of the AFP. By assuming external defense, the US 
caused the AFP to concentrate on internal defense and peace and order. 
By financing the cost of organizing the military, the US necessarily 
determined its size, training, equipment, and supplies. 

As the Pacific War drew to a close and the promised restoration of 
independence approached, the US began to plan for the transfer of 
sovereignty to the Philippines. Itprepared to provide military assistance 
to rebuild the army which it limited to 37,000 troops, to train and equip 
them, and to establish a group of American army, navy, and air force 
officers to provide military advice. 7 A program of military assistance was 
formulated through the 1946 Military Assistance Act authorizing $19. 75 
million to be administered in the Philippines by the Joint United States 
Military Advisory Group (JUSMAG). This relationship was sealed by 
the Military Assistance Agreement between the two countries on 21 
March 1947, an agreement which remains in effect until the present. 8 

The US turned over 33,000 army, 2,000 air force, and 1,800 naval 
forces to the Philippines on 30 June 1946 with second-hand US army 
equipment and supplies already located in the Philippines. Under the 
Agreement, the US had sent a select group of Filipino officers to 
American military academies and service schools since independence. 

The Joint Chiefs of Staff articulated on 22 May 1950 the assumption 
behind US military assistance to the Philippines thus 

A sound military policy for the Philippines at the present time justifies 
maximum emphasis and expenditures upon forces required for the mainte- 
nance of internal security and a minimum expenditure upon forces contributing 



30 f 

largely to national military prestige or to forces and resources largely designed 
for defense against external invaders • 

Thus, the AFP was not able to develop external defense capability. 
This was exacerbated by the fact that the Military Bases Agreement 
between the two countries signed on 14 March 1947 and the Mutual 
Defense Treaty of March 1951 reinforced external defense dependence 
on the US. US military presence in the bases, their largest overseas, and 
reliance on US assistance during peace and in case of external attack left 
the AFP developing largely an internal security function. 

A^3. The AFP and the Huk Insurgency 

From its establishment until the early 1940s, the AFP was confined 
to its original functions of defending the state. But the absence of a viable 
and immediate external threat to the Philippines, the emergence of the 
Huk (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon or Hukbalahap, more commonly 
known as Huks) insurgency, and US defense umbrella in the Philippines 
and the larger Asian region led the AFP to assume a leading role in the 
peace and order drive in the country. 

During this time, the AFP was completely subordinated to the 
civilian political authority. The President, being the Commander-in- 
Chief, enjoyed considerable control powers over the military. Congress 
fully used its authority to allocate funds and confirm senior military 
promotions. 

In the late 1940s, the rise of the Hukbalahap insurgency necessitated 
the expansion of the role of the AFP beyond its original functions. The 
Huks originated as a peasant-based movement pressing for agrarian 
reform. Havingfought against the Japanese during the latter^ occupation 
of the Philippines, the end of the war found them heavily-armed and 
well-organized. Contrary to their expectations, they were excluded from 
receiving pensions and other benefits because the government did not' 
recognize them as guerrillas. The Huks criticized the government's 
failure to initiate an agrarian reform program that would correct the 
inequitable land distribution in Philippine society, particularly in Central 
Luzon. In the 1946 elections, several congressmen-elect sympathetic to 
the Huks, including Luis Taruc, better known as the Huk Supremo, were 
prevented from assuming their seats. Losing faith in the electoral 
process and the government, the Huks then escalated their armed 
struggle under the slogan "bullets, not ballots." 10 



CHAPTER II 



31 



The AFP embarked on an extensive campaign to defeat the Huks. 
However, the strategy was not confined to armed combat. Under the 
direction of Defense Secretary Ramon Magsaysay, the strategy became 
a fusion of political, socio-economic, and military activities, thus signaling 
the start of the expansion of the military's protection, security, and 
peace-keeping functions. In addressing the Huk problem, Magsaysay 
used two different approaches: a mailed-fist policy and a policy of 
attraction. He said that "With my left hand I am offering to all dissidents 
the road to peace, happy homes and economic security, but with my right, 
I shall crush all those who resist and seek to destroy our democratic 
government." 11 He countered the Huk slogan with one of his own, 
"ballots, not bullets." 

Magsaysay was assisted by the JUSMAG. When Lt Col Edward 
Lansdale arrived in the Philippines in September 1950, the Huk 
insurgency was already escalating. Lansdale was not just a military 
adviser attached to JUSMAG. He was also the head of the Central 
Intelligence Agency's (CIA) clandestine and paramilitary operations in 
the country. With him was Capt Charles Bohannan from the US army 
intelligence unit. Together, they embarked on psychological warfare 
based on the premise that a popular guerrilla army cannot be defeated 
by force alone. 

Lansdale's team conducted a careful study of the superstitions of the 
Filipino peasants. In one operation, Lansdale's men flew over Huk areas 
in a small plane hidden by clouds and broadcast in Tagalog mysterious 
curses on any villager who would dare to give food or shelter to the 
Huks. 12 Another "psywar" operation played on the superstitious belief 
in the aswang, a mythical vampire. A psywar squad entered a town and 
planted rumors that an aswang lived in the neighboring hill where the 
Huks were based. After giving the rumor time to circulate, the squad laid 
an ambush for the Huk rebels along a trail used by them. The ambushers 
snatched the last man in the Huk patrol, punctured his neck with two 
holes, vampire fashion, held his body by the heels to drain the blood, and 
put the corpse back on the trail. When the Huks discovered their 
bloodless comrade, they fled from the region. 13 

Lansdale also held regular coffee sessions with Filipino officials 
and military personnel. Out of this came the Economic Development 
Corps (EDCOR) to lure the Huks with a program of resettlement. 
EDCOR became the government's response to the "land for the landless" 
slogan of the Huks. The plan of forming such an entity actually started 
even before World War II when ex-Senator Camilo Osias suggested it for 
republic schools. After liberation, the idea of an economic development 



32 



corps was espoused by the Army for the purpose of integrating 20-year- 
old recruits who were to be trained on mechanized farms into the pattern 
of national defense. But it was not until Magsaysay became the 
Secretary of National Defense that the plan turned into a reality. 
EDCOR was placed under military control. This was his "left hand" 
approach in attracting the dissidents to surrender. Six months after he 
took office, on 22 February 1951, the first EDCOR farm project was 
established at Kapatagan, Lanao del Sur. The project consisted of 1,600 
hectares of farm land for distribution to ex-Huks at the rate of about six 
to eight hectares per family. The Army would furnish each family with 
farm implements, a carabao, a house, seeds and other paraphernalia. In 
May 1947, the first batch of 56 ex-Huk families was taken at the Army's 
expense to Lanao. Six years later, a total of 978 families or nearly 5,000 
persons had been settled in the four EDCOR farms in Mindanao and 
Isabela in Luzon. 14 However, only 246, or 25 percent of these families 
were ex-Huks. Most were members of Magsay say's armed forces. 15 

The AFP also embarked on a host of socio-economic activities such 
as the building of roads, bridges, irrigation systems, ditches, and school 
buildings, in line with their counter-insurgency (COIN) program. They 
also provided free dental, medical, and legal services to residents in the 
rural areas. 

After assuming office on 30 December 1953 as the third President 
of the Republic, Magsaysay continued the use of the military in his socio- 
economic programs. He retained the defense portfolio until 14 May 1954. 

But despite the fact that the military performed duties beyond their 
traditional roles, the civilian political authority still remained supreme. 
Congress continued to exercise effective control over the military through 
its constitutional powers over the defense budget and the promotion of 
senior officers. 

However, discontent within the military establishment could not be 
dismissed as non-existent. As an aftermath of the 1949 presidential 
elections where there were charges of massive electoral fraud committed 
by Qumno, a guerrilla leader, one Col Medrano of Batangas, led a local 
rebellion and was reported to have solicited the support of the military. 
Similarly, in 1958, after Carlos P. Garcia became president following the 
death of Magsaysay, rumors of a coup were in the air. Although these 
rumors were never substantiated, Garcia took decisive action by 
dismissing Gen Jesus N. Vargas as Secretary of National Defense 16 



CHAPTER II 33 



But these were just plans which were never implemented, for it can 
be said that during that time, the demarcation lines between civilian and 
military authority were clearly defined. Civilian political institutions 
were relatively strong, regular elections provided the mechanism for 
changing leaders, and the military establishment faithfully adhered to 
the dictum that civilian authority is supreme over the military 
establishment. 

A.4. The AFP from 1957 to 1965 

At the time of Magsaysay^ death in 1957, the AFP had become 
involved in civic action and counter-insurgency functions, and in such 
various socio-economic projects as the building of schoolhouses, roads 
and bridges, digging of artesian wells, and the provision of medical and 
legal assistance to rural residents. 

During the incumbency of Garcia, the Socio-Economic Military 
Program (SEMP) was adopted as a military responsibility. It aimed to 
use the resources of the military in the socio-economic development of 
the country. It authorized the Chief of Staff to utilize military personnel 
for land resettlement, rural development, food production, and public 
works construction. Anumber of SEMP settlements were established in 
Mindanao, Luzon, and Panay islands. However, this endeavor was not 
then undertaken on a full-scale and permanent basis. 

President Diosdado Macapagal, who won the 1961 elections, did not 
believe that the military's role should be extended to involvement in civic 
action, unlike Magsaysay and Garcia. He terminated the AFP civic 
action programs arguing that civic action only encouraged the military 
to engage in politics. He strongly believed that civic action was not a 
function of the military. By 1965, there had been a substantial reduction 
in the AFFs presence in national life. They returned to their barracks 
and the regularity of military life. 

But it can be said that the military's involvement in counter- 
insurgency, in keeping with its function of providing internal security 
and maintaining peace and order, led it to participate in socio-economic 
activities, a task beyond its traditional role. 

B. The Involvement of the AFP as a Partner in National 
Development: 1966-1971 



After President Ferdinand E. Marcos assumed office on 30 December 
5, he made the AFP an integral component ofhis economic development 



34 



program. In his State of the Nation address, he emphasized that 

. . . the primary threat to our national security within the immediate future lies 
in internal subversion rather than from any external aggression. The military 
establishment will be developed along this basic premise in the years to come. 
However, since the development of our economy provides the permanent 
solution to this threat, I intend to harness to a greater extent the resources of 
our defense establishment in our task of nation building. It would be culpable 
negligence on our part if the peaceful uses of military forces were not availed 
of to the fullest extent possible in our continuing program of economic 
development. 17 

The Four- Year Economic Program formulated in September 1966 
and approved by the National Economic Council noted that 

. . . the Armed Forces of the Philippines with its manpower, material and 
equipment resources plus its organizational cohesiveness and discipline possesses 
a tremendous potential to participate in economic development which should be 
exploited to the maximum. Such participation becomes imperative considering 
that the problem besetting the country is socio-economic rather than military 
and that the resources available to solve this problem are scarse and limited. 18 

The foregoing policy pronouncements provided the rationale for the 
AFFs massive participation in socio-economic development. 

B.l. Career Development Programs to Suit 
Their New Role 

The AFFs new function required skills and expertise that would be 
necessary to make the military better qualified for Marcos's plans. In his 
1966 State of the Nation address, Marcos called for "increased training, 
new equipment and heightened morale . . ." 19 Imbuing the AFP with 
civilian management skills became one of the goals of his defense 
program. Service schools were re-equipped and re-staffed with career 
soldiers. At the first year of his presidency, it was reported that 

. . . 2,781 officers and enlisted men completed courses in local and foreign 
service schools. And 50,000 ROTC [Reserve Officers Training Course] cadets 
^mpetedtte 

Of all the major services the army was the most actively involved in 
professionalizing its forces. Special training was conducted during the year for 
167oflicers Severs ^1 combat exercises were also undertaken. Refresher courses 
were completed by 1,360 officers and men in the Constabulary, and 92 officers 

^^^ P0C -A In . the NaVy * 68 ° mCerS P artici P ate <* ^ training courses. 
Under the Military Assistance Program (MAP), 145 officers were trained in the 
U.S. . . .*° 

The National I Defense College of the Philippines (NDCP), activated 
on 9 September 1963, became the apex of the officer's military education. 



chapter n 35 



It is the only institution in the country with the mission of educating 
senior military leaders, as well as civilian executives from the government, 
for top positions in the national government and in national and 
international security structures. 

The NDCFs first regular course 1 started on 6 February 1966. By 
June 1972, a total of 93 students in six classes had been graduated. In 
the next six years (July 1972 to June 1978), it graduated another 251 
students in six classes or 151 percent over the first six classes. 

Majority of its graduates were holding key and sensitive positions 
in their respective offices by 1977. Most of these graduates were 
responsible for the formulation of national or agency policies regarding 
national security. Among its graduates from the military, 37 had been 
promoted to the grade of general as of 1977. 21 

Occupying the next rung below NDCP in the officer's military 
education is the AFP Command and General Staff College (CGSC) which 
was activated in 1969, with its first class held in July of that year. 
Previously, each major service command, except the PC, had its own 
command and staff school, the Army being the first to establish one. All 
of these command and staff schools were integrated into the CGSC. 

Just like its previous counterparts in the different military services, 
the CGSC aims to prepare officers for senior level positions. However, 
in its briefing paper, the CGSC explains that training of top military 
men should not be limited to military matters. Although it is not 
explicitly stated, the institution appears to be concerned with training 
military men for civilian leadership roles. It envisioned the ideal of a 
military professional with a broad perspective of a committed leader and 
the incisive and analytical mind of a statesman. When the CGSC 
started, most of the subjects were military courses. Through the years, 
changes in the curriculum were mostly in terms of management courses. 

The CGSC had conducted the following courses: Command and 
General Staff Regular Course (CGSRC), Command and General Staff 
Associate Course (CGSAC), Command and General StaffSpecial Course 
(CGSSC), Technical Service Command and StaffCourse (TSCSC), Non- 
Residence Correspondence Course (NRCC), and Battalion Commanders' 
Course (BCC). The CGSC also conducted important seminars as Crisis 
Managementon Ho stage Negotiations, Curriculum Development Course, 
and briefings on human rights. To date, the CGSC has graduated 2,322 
AFP officers as shown in Table IM. 



36 



The Philippine Military Academy (PMA) is the country's only military 
academy for professional career officers. The Academy traces its 
beginnings to the officers' school of the Philippine Constabulary in 
Manila which opened on 17 February 1905. With the passage of 
Commonwealth Act No. 1, the Constabulary Academy rose to full college 
status. It offers an academic curriculum of four years leading to a degree 
ofbachelor of science. Graduates are commissioned as second lieutenants 
in the regular force.

Other military schools include the following; the Metropolitan Citizen 
Military Training Command (MCMTC), Armed Forces of the Philippines 
Training Command (AFPTC), Philippine Air Force Flying School 
(PAFFS), PA Training Command (PA TRACOM), Naval Training 
Command (NTC), and the Philippine Constabulary Training Command 
(PC TRACOM). A discussion of the kind of training that candidate- 
officers undergo at the PMA and at the aforementioned military schools 
is made in the next chapter. 

The AFP also sent their men to take advance degrees at various 
civilian schools and universities, including the College of Public 



chapter n 37 



Administration at the University of the Philippines, the Asian Institute 
of Management, and at the graduate schools of business of Ateneo de 
Manila University and De La Salle University. 

Other training programs undertaken by the military establishment 
to make its men better prepared for their newly-assigned roles included 
the training and equipping of the AFP engineering battalions from 1967 
to 1968 in exchange for the Philippine government's commitment to send 
a civic action team to Vietnam. This was undertaken with a $7 million 
grant from the US. 22 

The AFP also relied on the training programs provided by the US as 
a form of military aid under the Mutual Assistance Program. By 1971, 
Philippine military personnel, numbering 13,588, had received training 
from the US. Specifically, some 8,729 were trained within the continental 
US. One hundred and fifty-three senior officers had attended US 
command and general staff schools. During 1969 and 1970, five US 
military teams were detailed to assist the AFP in training, supply, 
maintenance, and equipment operations at an estimated cost of 

The AFP also participated in training programs provided by other 
countries. Under the Defense Cooperation Program (DCP), AFP personnel 
have undertaken training courses and study visits in Australia since 
1960. A total of 1,021 military personnel have participated in DCP 
training programs from the time it was initiated until the present year 
as shown in Table II-2. 

The AFP also participated in study visits under the DCP to familiarize 
senior AFP officers with Australian Defence Force activities and 
procedures. Study visits included the following: 

a. Dockyard Management 

b. Personnel Management

B.2. National Development Programs Undertaken 
by the AFP 



With the decision in 1966 to tap military resources for economic 
development, the AFP embarked on a socio-economic program of 
unprecedented scale under the banner of "civic action." Projects under 
civic action fell into two general groupings: those in support of national 
development program, and those in support of regional or community 
development programs. Under the former were the construction of 
highways, feeder roads, and pre-fabricated schoolhouse buildings, 
irrigation development, flood control, dredging and reclamation, 
manpower development, land resettlement, and industrial site planning. 
Under the latter were the civic action centers (Home Defense Centers or 
HDCs), servicing of regional development programs, and assisting the 
Department of Health in the provision of medical and dental services to 
the rural population. 26 

The most significant achievements of the civic action program were 
J the field of Public works. In the first Four- Year Economic Program, 
Marcos stressed the need for a public works program amounting to T3 



40 



billion with 1*960.4 million or 31.06 percent for the construction of new 

of the construction program and the relatively short period within which 
fwas expected to be accomplished, Marcos mobilized the manpower,

Engineer Brigade were increased to 15 by 1967. 

For a period of one year (1966), the 51st Engineer Brigade alone 
completed 13 major construction projects with a total cost ot T"3.1o 
million which was more than 50 percent of what was undertaken by the 
Corps of Engineers in twelve and one half years under previous 
administrations. 

From 1966 to 1973, an approximate comparison can be made of the 
total national accomplishment with that of the AFP's on a number 
of infrastructure activities as shown in Table II-4. 2 . 6

11 



Although the AFFs contribution in the construction of highways, 
secondary roads, and bridges was very minimal in terms of the national 
total, its contribution to the construction of feeder roads was very 
substantial, amounting to 30 percent of the total. Feeder roads are those 
made of dirt or gravel to connect rural and far-flung areas to towns and 
cities. 

In meeting the acute shortage of schoolhouses, the AFP constructed 
4,185 units of Army-type pre-fabricated schoolhouses and fabricated 
6,500 units of the Marcos-type from 1966 to June 1969. This constituted 
46 percent of the administration's pre-fabricated school building output 
from 1966 to 1969. 27 

The Navy, for its part, implemented dredging programs. The Air 
Force, by 1969, covered more than 3.2 million hectares with photo- 
grammetry for mapping purposes. 28 In 28 provinces, 37 HDCs were 
established in the same year. These HDCs served as the focal point for 
coordinating inter-agency support for community self-help projects. The 
activities undertaken by the HDCs were many and varied, from 
community irrigation in Luzon to seminars in deep sea fishing in Sulu. 

The AFP also provided free medical and dental services, especially 
in rural areas. By 1969, there were 25 military rural health teams 
operating in 17 provinces, attending to the public health in medically- 
distressed areas. In fiscal year 1968 - 1969, 89,613 medical and 43,403 
dental patients were treated. 29 

B.3. Internal Security and Peace and Order 

Despite the preoccupation with civic action, the AFP continued to 
undertake its role of maintaining peace and order in the country. Law 
enforcement was continually carried out by the PC. They were quite 
successful in their drive against smuggling during the first year and 
a half of Marcos's incumbency. 30 The PC, with assistance from the 
Philippine Navy, arrested at least 100 of the most important smugglers. 

In the Greater Manila Area (GMA), crime figures were on the rise 
when Marcos became president. GMA was composed of 4 cities and 13 
municipalities, each having its own police force. In 1968, Marcos 
established the Metropolitan Area Command (METROCOM) of the PC. 
It assisted local police forces in GMA in dealing with urban unrest among 
workers and students. Other units of the AFP were transferred to the 
METROCOM, beefing it up to a force of 1,700 officers and enlisted men, 
from a meager 300-man team. From 1 August 1968 to 1 July 1970, the 



42 



METROCOM was under the administrative and operational control of 
GHQ, but aft -r this period, the PC took over, making the METROCOM 
one of the major subordinate commands of the PC with a status equal to 
that of a PC Zone Command in the provinces. 31 Aside from assisting the 
local police forces in general crime fighting, the METROCOM also 
assisted local police agencies in the arrest, detention, search and seizure 
of suspects in criminal investigation and prosecution, especially in cases 
involving illegal possession of firearms, carnapping, and other serious 
offenses. Trained by the US in crowd control techniques, METROCOM 
obtained the opportunity to apply what it learned in dispersing 
demonstrations held at the US Embassy, Malacanang and in other 
places in 1970 and 1971. 

The AFP was also deputized during elections. In 1969, the Commis- 
sion on Elections (COMELEC) mobilized the military in manning the 
polls. In 1971, military personnel were asked to keep the polls orderly 
and to guard the ballotboxes from the electoral precincts to the tabulating 
center in Manila. 32 

B.4. Structural Changes in the Military 

When Marcos assumed the presidency, he retained the defense 
portfolio for the first 13 months of his term, following the precedent set 
by Magsaysay. Marcos immediately undertook the largest reshuffle in 
the history of the Philippine military, 33 Of the 25 flag officers, 14 were 
forced to retire, including the AFP Chief and Vice Chief of Staff, the 
CommandingGeneral of the Army, the Chief of PC, all four Constabulary 
zone commanders, and approximately one-third of the provincial 
commanders. 34 A number of key appointments were given to officers 
from Marcos's home province of Ilocos Norte. Retired BGen Ernesto 
Mata was recalled to active duty and was appointed Chief of Staff. BGen 
Segundo Velasco became Chief of PC and Col Fabian C. Ver was 
appointed commander of the Presidential Security Command (PSC). All 
three were from Ilocos Norte. These moves can be seen as an early 
attempt on the part of Marcos to place men loyal to him in key positions 
in the AFP. 

In the South, increasing criminal activities such as smuggling, 
cattle-rustling, and the conflict between the Christians and the Muslims 
led to the establishment of the Southwest Command (SOWESCOM) in 
Zamboanga City on 21 September 1968. It became the first unified 
command in the AFP. It was composed of elements of the Army, 
Constabulary, Air Force, and the Navy. It guarded the southern 
backdoor. Its operations included the maintenance of peace and order, 



chapter n 43 



anti-smuggling, anti-piracy, anti-subversion, and campaign against 
other acts inimical to national security. On 1 May 1976, SOWESCOM 
became the Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), with jurisdiction over 
the whole of Southern Philippines and the responsibility of maintaining 
peace and order, assistingin the socio-economic development of the area, 
and guarding it from external and internal threats. 35 

B.5. Participation in a Foreign War 

The Philippines also sent a unit to Vietnam. The Philippine Civic 
Action Group Vietnam (PHILCAG V) was the country's contribution to 
the Allied efforts in that country. PHILCAG V was involved in the 
construction and repair of roads, bridges, buildings, in the resettlement 
of the refugees, and in attending to the sick and wounded from both sides 
of the battlefront in Vietnam. 

From all of the foregoing discussion, it can be concluded that the role 
of the AFP increased under Marcos. But the utilization of the armed 
forces in socio-economic development programs is not a novel idea. It has 
been done in other countries. Marcos was not a pioneer in the field. The 
AFP also undertook socio-economic programs during the Magsaysay era. 
However, it was only during Marcos's term when the non-military role 
of the AFP became institutionalized. Before Marcos, military role 
expansion took place within a political environment where the political 
institutions were relatively strong, the rules of the political game were 
observed, and the supremacy of civilian authority over the military was 
intact. 



C. Martial Law 1972 - 1986: Political Consequences 
and Impact on the AFP 

With Proclamation 1081, Marcos placed the Philippines under 
martial law. He claimed that it was warranted by threats to public safety 
and the security of the nation arising from increased terroristic activities 
of insurgent groups, specifically, the Communist Party of the Philippines 
(CPP) and the Muslim rebel groups in Southern Philippines. Proclamation 
1081, signed on 21 September 1972, stated that 

• • . on the basis of carefally evaluated and verified information, it is definitely 
established that lawless elements who are moved by a common or similar 
ideological conviction, design, strategy and goal, and enjoying the active moral 
and material support of a foreign power and being guided and directed by 
intensely devoted, well-trained, determined and ruthless groups of men and 
seeking refuge under the protection of our constitutional liberties to promote 



44 



and attain their ends, have entered into a conspiracy and have in fact joined and 
banded their resources and forces together for the prime purpose of, and in fact 
they have been, and are actually staging, undertaking and waging an armed 
insurrection and rebellion against the Government of the Republic of the 
Philippines in order to forcibly seize political and state power in this country, 
overthrow the duly constituted Government, and supplant our existing political, 
social, economic and legal order with an entirely new one. . . 



As Commander-in -Chief of the Armed Forces, Marcos ordered the 
military to "maintain law and order throughout the Philippines, prevent 
or suppress all forms of lawless violence as well as any act of insurrection 
or rebellion and to enforce obedience to all laws and decrees, orders and 

regulations " 37 Marcos clarified that the proclamation of martial law 

was not a military takeover. 38 The military authorities would only be 
implementing martial law to protect the country. He cited the 1935 
Constitution and assured that the AFP would continue to uphold the 
supremacy of civilian authority. 39 

Contrary to these pronouncements, however, the military was actually 
involved in the decision to put the country under martial law. In a speech 
before the AFP in celebration of Loyalty Day, Marcos revealed that 12 
high defense officials formed the key group, who were in constant 
consultation with each other regarding the decision to place the country 
under martial law. The 12 men had been variously called the "Twelve 
Disciples," 40 the "Twelve Apostles," 41 and the "Rolex 12". 42 They were 
Defense Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile, AFP Chief of Staff Gen Romeo 
Espino, PA Commanding Officer MGen Rafael Zagala, PC Chief MGen 
Fidel V. Ramos, PAF Chief MGen Jose Rancudo, PN Commander RAdm 
Hilario Ruiz, PSC Chief MGen Fabian C. Ver, AFP Chief of Intelligence 
MGen Ignacio Paz, 1st PC Zone Commander BGen Tomas Diaz, PC 
METROCOM Commander BGen Alfredo Montoya, Rizal PC Commander 
Col Romeo Gatan, and Congressman Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr. The latter 
was recalled to active duty with the rank of colonel. 43 Vice Chief of Staff 
Gen Rafael Ileto was against the plan because he thought the declaration 
of martial law would not be proper at that time. He was subsequently 
named Philippine Ambassador to Iran, becoming the first active duty 
officer to hold an ambassadorial post in the country's history. 44 

Soon after the declaration of martial law, Congress was abolished, 
mass activities were prohibited, political parties were outlawed, and 
civil and political rights were suspended. Newspaper publications were 
ordered closed and curfew was strictly implemented. 

General Order (GO) No. 1 gave the President the power to "govern 
the nation and direct the operation of the entire government including 



all its agencies and instrumentalities." 46 GO No. 2 ordered the arrest of 
individuals who were perceived to be participants in a conspiracy to seize 
political and state power. 46 This was later amended by GO No. 19 which 
authorized the arrest and detention of any person who shall utter, 
publish, distribute, circulate, and spread false news and information. 47 
GO No. 4 ordered the observance of curfew hours from 12:00 midnight to 
4:00 in the morning. 4 * Rallies, demonstrations, and other forms of group 
actions were prohibited, 49 as well as the possession of firearms unless 
duly authorized. 50 

The abolition of civilian institutions like Congress, the weakening of 
the judiciary, and the outlawing of political parties, left the military as 
the only other instrumentality of the national government outside of the 
Presidency. The military had been called to save the Republic and 
restore confidence in the "democratic traditions" cherished by the 
Filipinos. In a country with no militaristic tradition — and where the 
military was traditionally low key — the AFP became very visible, 
performing a more expanded mission, such as security, law and order, 
administration of justice, greater management and administrative 
functions, and developmental, political and miscellaneous roles. 51 

C.l. Military Participation in Politics 
C.l.a. Martial Law Implementor 

The military became one of the vital supports of the regime. Apart 
from external defense, the AFP was also charged with the suppression 
of rebellion and the enforcement of all laws, decrees, orders, and 
regulations issuedby Marcos. They enforced nationwide curfew, collection 
of unlicensed firearms, and the suppression of rallies, strikes, and 
demonstrations. Letter of Instructions (LOI) No. 98 vested in the PC the 
task of maintaining peace and order in corn procurement areas and the 
enforcement of pertinent rules of the National Grains Authority (NGA) 
in line with the government's massive corn procurement program. 52 The 
military was also ordered to assist other government offices in the 
implementation of price control imposed on commodities such as corn 
and milled rice. 53 The Secretary of National Defense was directed to 
provide assistance in the collection of loans incurred from rural banks, 
the Philippine National Bank, and the Agricultural Credit Admi- 
nistration. 54 The agrarian reform law, by virtue of Presidential Decree 
(PD) No. 27, was also implemented by the military. LOI No. 45 



46 



authorized the PC Provincial Commanders to receive sworn statements 
of landowners to be submitted to the Secretary of National Defense. 66 

C.l.b. Centralization of Police Forces 

Peace and order problems continued to be the responsibility of the 
PC. In 1975, police forces were incorporated into the Integrated National 
Police (INP) and placed under the command of the PC chief. These 
efforts may be viewed as an attempt to centralize political control by 
taking away a very important power from local governments. 66 The PC 
also supervised other law enforcement agencies technically outside the 
jurisdiction of the military. The PC/INP absorbed as special agencies the 
law enforcement units of the Land Transportation Commission (LTC), 
the Central Bank (CB), Bureau of Customs, Bureau of Internal Revenue 
(BIR), the Bureau of Fisheries, and the Bureau of Forest Development. 67 

C.l.c. The Presidential Security Command 

The security role of the PSC was also expanded. Initially, the 
security of the President and Malacanang was the responsibility of the 
Presidential Security Unit (PSU). Under Ver, the PSU was expanded 
to battalion strength and became the Presidential Security Battalion 
(PSB). Much later, the PSB became an independent command, with 
more men than a battalion, and was renamed Presidential Security 
Command (PSC). It became one of the stepping stones of Ver in his rise 
to power. When he became the AFP Chief of Staff in August 1981, Ver 
relinquished formal command of the PSC to BGen Santiago Barangan. 
In reality, however, Ver and his sons exercised de facto control over PSjD. 
Col Irwin Ver was the PSC's Chief of Staff and Lt Col Rexor Ver was 
Commander of the PSU. 58 

The PSC was also involved in intelligence work, since its commander 
was also the head of the National Intelligence Security Agency (NISA). 59 

Originally, the intelligence structure of the AFP was drawn up from 
the individual service commands. Joint intelligence became the function 
of the Intelligence Service of the AFP (ISAFP). The National Intelligence 
Coordinating Agency (NICA) was responsible for super-vision and 
coordination of all intelligence services. NISA took over the functions of 
NICA. Itbecame the dominant intelligence force and the "eyes and ears" 
of the regime. 60 



AFP units in a region were also unified in a composite force under a 
commander and his staff. This gave birth to the Regional Unified 



Command (RUC). RUCs were composite divisions where PC, PAF, PA, 
and PN, as well as Marine units were integrated under one command to 
facilitate better coordination of combat and support operations. Aside 
from artillery support, the RUCs were also provided with armored 
fighting vehicles and air support. It was contended that such centra- 
lization would result in efficient disaster control and relief operations, 
and greater responsiveness in civic action programs. 61 However, 
centralization also helped prop up the dictatorship of Marcos and the 
control of the AFP by Ver. 

C.l.d. Participation in Judicial Functions 

The military was also vested with judicial functions. GO No. 8 
empowered the Chief of Staff to create military tribunals to try and 
decide cases of military personnel and other such cases as may be 
referred to them. 62 These other cases were spelled out in GO No. 12 63 
which included crimes against national security, violations of the Anti- 
Subversion Law and the Laws on Espionage, crimes against public 
order, and crimes committed by public officials, among others. By 1974, 
20 military tribunals had been set up. In December, LOI No. 237 was 
issued. It ordered the return of many cases from the military tribunals 
to civilian courts. Despite this directive, some cases still remained with 
Military Commissions such as those against Senator Benigno S. Aquino, 
Jr (Ninoy), Jose Ma Sison (Joma) and Lt Victor Corpuz. 

C.l.e. Management Functions 

The military was also tasked with the control and management of all 
media communication and public utilities such as the Manila Electric 
Co, the Philippine National Railways, Philippine Airlines Inc, and the 
National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority. The military was em- 
powered to take over and control the assets of corporations as the Jacinto 
Steel, Inc, Jacinto Iron and Steel Sheets Corp, J and P Shipping Corp, 
Perro Products, the Iligan Integrated Steel Mills, the Elizalde Steel Co, 
and the Elizalde Rolling Mills, Inc. The then AFP Chief of Staff Espino 
became the board chairman of the Jacinto companies. 

Many military personnel were detailed to civilian offices and 
individuals. Military personnel were designated as representatives of 
Marcos to and military supervisors of certain civilian offices, such as the 
Board of Transportation, Land Transportation Commission, the offices 
of the city and district engineers, the Philippine Coconut Authority 
(PCA), and the Philippine Sugar Commission. 



48 



GHQ issued a circular dated 18 June 1974 which laid out the policies, 
procedures and guidelines regarding the detail of military personnel to 
civilian offices. Detailed military personnel were classified into 
categories: 64 

Category I - Those detailed with utility firms, public utilities, 
civilian government agencies, and important 
persons 

Category II - Those detailed with government corporations and 
private agencies 

Category III - Those detailed with the Ministry of National 
Defense 

Category IV - Those detailed with the Office of the President and 
the National Intelligence and Security Agency. 

Since the declaration of martial law until 1980, there were 349 
officers and 830 enlisted personnel, or a total of 1,179 detailed outside 
the AFP. 66 In April 1980, GHQ ordered the return of military men to the 
AFP as a response to the personnel shortage of the combat and combat 
support units in the field, especially in Southern Philippines. After the 
recall, 115 officers and 298 enlisted men continued to be detailed outside 
the AFP. As shown in Table II-5, of the 115 officers, 20 were from the 
PAF, 34 from PN, 26 from PC and 28 from PA. Seven came from the 
Technical Services.

CHAPTER II 49 



Most of these officers and men were detailed with the Ministry of 
National Defense (MND) in various capacities. Others were assigned in 
civilian offices like the PCA, the Jacinto Corporation, the Philippine 
Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration 
(PAGASA), BIR, Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Agriculture, and the 
Philippine National Oil Co. 66 

C.1X Investment Activities 

Marcos also rewarded the military with investment corporations. 
PD No. 257 created the Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea 
Investment and Development Corporation (PEFTOK-IDC). 67 PEFTOK- 
IDC was granted :P4 million in capital stock. The decree granted the 
corporation the power to engage in various commercial enterprises as 
the creation of all kinds of investment opportunities, development of 
agriculture, acquisition of lands for agricultural, pastural and related 
purposes, and engagement in the business of general and wholesale 
merchants and exporters, among others. 

Another investment corporation that was created for the military 
was the Philippine Veterans Investment Development Co (PHIVIDEC), 
established in 1973. 68 The initial capitalization was valued at $500,000 
which was expanded to 1*10 million by the end of 1973. It was exempted 
from tax and was opened to military personnel on active duty. 

C.l.g. Developmental Roles 

The military institution also embarked on developmental roles, in 
keeping with the tradition started by Magsaysay and was utilized to the 
fullest in the first years of the incumbency of Marcos. 

From 1972 to 1977, the AFP participated in the construction of 2,866 
school buildings with an aggregate cost of f*97.7 million. They also 
participated in the construction and repair of irrigation systems, rural 
electrification systems, and resettlement homes worth "P244 million. 
The military helped the government in its anti-pollution campaign 
through the inspection of factories and industrial sites, as well as the 
clearing of 23,168 square meters of waterways and 269,155 square 
meters of esteros in the GMA. For the same period, 1.3 million medical 
and dental patients were treated. 

a:; 

The AFP had also conducted 1,301 air evacuation missions, 506 
airlift and 88 search and rescue missions. All over the country, 2,237 
hectares of agricultural land within military camps had been cultivated 



50 



and 11,567 heads of cattle and hogs were raised. The AFP also planted 
more than 100,000 trees in support of the national reforestation program, 
and 683 rain-making sorties were undertaken by the Air Force to 
preserve the viability of watersheds and agricultural lands. 69 

In the field of construction, AFP engineer battalions completed a 
total of 1*1.33 billion worth of infrastructure projects from 1973 to 31 
July 1982 as shown in Table 11-67°

regional objectives. Three out of the original 11 PROD s were military 
officers: Region II was under the Commanding General of the Northeast 
Command, Region IX was under the Commander of SOWESCOM, and 
Region X was under the Commanding General of the 4th Infantry 
Division (4 ID). By 1978, six out of the 12 regions had military men as 
PRODs: Region II was under Col Gil Manuel, Region III was under Col 
Benjamin Santos, Region VII was under BGen Mario Espina, Region EX 
was under RAdm Romulo Espaldon, Region X was under BGen Alfonso 
Alcoseba, and Region XI was under Col Emilio Ahorro. 71 Obviously, 
military men were assigned as PRODs in areas with insurgency problems, 
where the military did not only perform its role of protecting the country 
from internal subversion, but also assumed a developmental role as part 
of the overall counter-insurgency strategy. 

C.lJi. Political Functions 

Marcos appointed active duty officers to perform civilian functions 
in government and state organizations. A number of officers acted as 
officials of political units. For example, BGen Benjamin Duque was 
appointed as Governor of Sultan Kudarat in Maguindanao province 
while RAdm Espaldon became Governor of Tawi-Tawi, on the basis of 
the rationale that these were areas with serious problems of internal 
security. With the dismantling of Congress and the ban on political 
parties and activities, the military was able to replace traditional 
politicians, and became the dispensers of political patronage. 72 

Other roles and functions contributed to the visibility of the military. 
By authority of Paragraph 4, Section 2 of ArticleX of the 1973 Constitution, 
COMELEC was granted the power to deputize, with the consent or at 
the instance of the Prime Minister, law enforcement agencies of the 
government including the AFP to ensure free, orderly, and honest 
elections. From then on, the military was Used extensively during 
elections in the succeeding years. COMELEC Resolution No. 1313, 
promulgated on 4 April 1978, deputized the AFP during the elections on 
7 April 1978. Similarly, COMELEC Resolution No. 1434, promulgated 
on 14 January 1980, called on the AFP to help in the 30 January 1980 
local elections. 

C.2. The Growth and Expansion of the AFP 

This expansion in role was accompanied by an increase in size and 
budget. The AFP grew from 57,100 in 1971 to 113,000 in 1976, with a 
marked increase of 97.89 percent over a five-year period. Tocomplement 
the regular forces in the battle against the New People's Army, the 



52 



Integrated Civilian Home Defense Forces (ICHDF) was formed. By 
1985 the defense establishment included about 274,300 regulars and 
paramilitary personnel, plus another 124,000 men as reserves as shown 
in Table II-7. For purposes of comparison, the figures for 1990 tor the 
major services are also shown. The military budget also increased by 
500 percent in four years, from ^880 million in 1972 to ?4 billion in 
1976. 73

CHAPTER n 53 



But while the size of the military increased, the AFP experienced 
shortage of combat personnel which led to mass enlistment and the 
transfer of men from desk jobs to the field. Lacking adequate training 
and discipline, these contributed to deprofessionalization and demora- 
lization, especially among the men in the field. 

C.3. The Rise of the Twin Insurgencies: CPP and MNLF 

The arrest of the leaders of the Partldo Komunista ng Pilipinas 
(PKP) in 1952 led to demoralization among the ranks. By 1954, the Huk 
rebellion had virtually collapsed. Pursuit of the armed struggle was 
further discouraged by the enactment of the Anti-Subversion Law in 
1957 with severe penalties for membership in the PKP. 

In the late 1960s, intellectual and political ferment among young 
students at the University of the Philippines (UP), much impressed by 
Marxism and such international events as the Cuban Revolution and 
China's Cultural Revolution, formed the Kabataang Makabayan (KM) 
led by Amado Guerrero (reportedly the pen name of Joma Sison). They 
joined the PKP through the mediation of an Indonesian postgraduate 
student at UP, but were expelled in 1967 due to ideological, generational, 
and leadership differences with the old PKP leaders. These young 
Marxists formed the CPP. 74 

Meanwhile, a Huk faction under Commander Sumulong degenerated 
into a crime syndicate. Disgusted, one of his lieutenants, Commander 
Dante (Bernabe Buscayno), seceded with his men and joined the CPP. 
Thus, the "marriage between Dante's army in search for a party and 
Guerrero's party in search for an army gave birth to the NPA [New 
People's Army] on 29 March 1969." 75 The National Democratic Frqnt 
(NDF) was established in April 1973 to unite all left-oriented groups 
fighting the Marcos regime under one umbrella. 

The NPA insurgency grew substantially during the Marcos regime. 
Although the size of the military increased through mass enlistment, 
the men lacked adequate training, equipment, and support. With the 
breakdown of discipline, human rights violations increased, and demo- 
ralization set in as the military failed to secure mass support or to 
suppress the insurgency despite its size. 

Furthermore, the mismanagement of the economy and rise of "crony" 
capitalism and graft and corruption exacerbated the poverty problem, 
especially in the rural areas. The government gradually lost control of 
the countryside, unable to implement a meaningful socio-economic 



54 



approach to the problem of insurgency. Instead, NPA recruitment 
intensified. 

On the other hand, Mindanao has been marked by tension between 
Muslims and Christian settlers. In 1968, a separatist Muslim (later 
Mindanao) Independence Movement (MIM) led by older-generation 
Muslim leaders, declared the independence of Mindanao from the 
Republic. Young Muslim recruits, the Group of 90, were trained by 
English and Palestinian mercenaries in the forests of Malaysia to 
organize an army for MIM. However, disillusionment with and lack of 
trust in traditional Muslim leaders led these young recruits to form the 
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Bangsa Moro Army 
(BMA) in mid- 1971, henceforth, to act in behalf of the Bangsa Moro. 
Nur Misuari, a contemporary of many KM leaders at UP, became the 
MNLFs leader. However, the 1971 local elections drew its members 
away from the MNLF. Many of the members of the Group of .90 joined 
the Barracudas and Blackshirts, armed Muslim groups which fought the 
anti-Muslim Ilagas. 76 

The declaration of martial law convinced the MNLF leadership that 
peaceful change for Muslims was no longer possible. The order to 
surrender all firearms by Marcos, and the program to create a "new 
society" were interpreted as repression of their aspirations for separate 
identity. 77 In October 1972, they launched an armed struggle against the 
regime which escalated to dangerous proportions with serious 
implications for the AFP. 

The conflict invited the involvement of the Organization of Islamic 
Conference (OIC), some of whose members supported the MNLF. 
Negotiations between the MNLF and the Marcos government mediated 
by the OIC led to the conclusion of the Tripoli Agreement in December 
1976. Pursuant to it, two autonomous regional governments were set up 
in Muslim Mindanao. Development programs were undertaken to 
improve conditions there and Muslim rebel surrenderees were integrated 
mto the AFP. These reflected the government's recognition that a purely 
military solution to insurgency, whether communist or Muslim would 
not work. 

D. The Lifting of Martial Law: More Form 
Than Substance (1981 - 1986) 

n^tt la h W WW ^ ^ J l nUai7 1981 by of Proclamation 

2045 on the basis hat "anarchy had been successfully checked, the 
leftist-rightist rebellion substantially contained and the secessionist 



chapter n 55 



movement effectively overcome." 78 But it was a cosmetic act. Subs- 
tantively, nothing much had changed. Civil liberties continued to be 
constrained and the media remained under control. Although political 
parties were allowed to exist, electoral laws and regulations favored the 
ruling party organized by Marcos, the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL). 
In 1984, the regular Batasang Pambansa, with only about 50 active 
opposition members, was convened. 

The military's martial law roles and the machinery for their effective 
pursuit remained intact even after the lifting of Proclamation 1081. It 
continued to manage the Jacinto group of companies. Military tribunals 
continued to exercise jurisdiction over cases involving subversion. The 
military continued to implement presidential orders and decrees and 
went on with its law and order functions such as the suppression of 
strikes and other forms of mass actions. 

The role expansion of the AFP enhanced its capacity to intervene 
directly in the political affairs of the country. The abolition of Congress, 
the muzzling of the press, and the weakening of the judiciary left Marcos 
as the only civilian authority in control of the military. Ma cos used the 
military to enforce his orders and decrees, and to perpetuate himself in 
power. 

In exchange, Marcos coddledhis favorites in the military. Promotions 
continued to be his sole prerogative and personal loyalty became the 
primary criterion. Well-connected officers were able to place their people 
in key and juicy positions. This was noted by then Vice Chief of Staff Lt 
Gen Ramos in a letter to Marcos dated 19 February 1986. He wrote that 
the constant jockeying for key positions by some officers to obtain 
"midnight" appointments would not be good for the AFP, considering the 
grave and complex problems that the country faced. 79 

The presence of extendee generals effectively blocked the promo- 
tions of middle-grade officers. Besides Ver and the three major service 
commanders — MGen Josephus Ramas, Commanding General, PA, 
MGen Vicente Piccio, Commanding General, PAF, and RAdm Brillante 
Ochoco, Flag Officer in Command (FOIC), PN, the other 18 extendees 
were MGen Delfin Castro, BGen Angel Kanapi, BGen Carlos V. Martel, 
BGen Hamilton Dimaya, BGen Cirilo Oropesa, BGen Angel Mapua, 
BGen Alejandro Felix, BGen Andres Ramos, BGen Arsenio Silva, BGen 
Mariano Miranda, BGen Madrino Munoz, BGen Sinfroso Duque, BGen 
Leo Santos, BGen Santiago Barangan, BGen Narciso Creus, BGen 
Ramon Cannu, BGen Manuel Mercado, and BGen Telesforo Tayko. 80

Consequently, some officers became retirable at a fairly young age 
but at fairly lower ranks. A lot of officers were bypassed. A number of 
officers were promoted over several other more senior and qualified 
candidates. A breakdown in the merit system and demoralization 
became inevitable. 

In the field, the men in combat suffered losses not only because of 
inadequate training and shortage of equipment and supplies but also 
because of the lack of troops. The need for manpower resulted in mass 
enlistment and the transfer of men from desk jobs to armed combat. The 
concomitant result was that such troops fought against insurgents 
seasoned in guerrilla warfare. 

In August 1983, Ver was implicated in the assassination of Ninoy 
Aquino. Marcos was forced to place Ver on a leave of absence while the 
investigation was going on. After being initially cleared by the 
Sandiganbayan, Ver immediately resumedhis position as Chief of Staff. 

The assassination unleashed massive popular opposition to the 
Marcos regime and the military organization that sustained it. Nino/s 
martyrdom united the people and gave them courage to openly oppose 
the dictatorship. It became dear that the military leadership was a 
willing tool to perpetuate the regime at all costs. 

Within the military, the assassination and the shame that attended 
it brought to the fore latent disaffection among some officers leading to 
the eventual movement for reform. 

Independently of the assassination, a number of organizations 
began to sprout as Ver and his men continued their efforts to control the 
entire establishment. During the height of the Mindanao crisis in the 
early 1980s, the Diablo Squad wis organized for mutual assistance of 
enlisted personnel. It was ordered disbanded by Ver but reappeared as 
the Guardians Brotherhood, Inc (GBI). 81 Their purpose of fostering 
mutual understanding and cooperation among members of the AFP and 
the INP remained the same as Diablo's original objectives. The GBI is 
duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ex-Lt 
Co Gregono Honasan's role in the GBI is not clear, but he signed the 
Articles of Incorporation of GBI as a witness. 82 

But the most prominent group was the Reform the Armed Forces 
Movement^ 

fh?AF?! It ^ eir f^Z° M be * eared ***** the attainment of 
the AFFs new thrust of uplifting the morale and welfare of every man 



and woman in uniform, enhancing the operational effectiveness of the 
military establishment, and restoring the people's faith in the armed 
forces. With its initial members coming from PMA classes 1971 to 1984, 
membership expanded to include retired alumni who voiced out publicly 
their sentiments while many active officers signified their support 
quietly. A fuller discussion of the RAM is made in Chapter IV. 

E. Post-EDSA (1986 - 1989): Return to Barracks? 

When the Aquino administration came to power, it sought to redefine 
the role of the military. The 1987 Constitution, over-whelmingly ratified 
by the Filipino people, embodied principles which soughtto establish the 
proper spheres of military activity. In its Declaration of Principles and 
State Policies, the following articles state that 

SEC. 3. Civilian authority is, at all times, supreme over the military. The 
Armed Forces of the Philippines is the protector of the people and the State. Its 
goal is to secure the sovereignty of the State and the integrity of the national 
territory. 

SEC. 4. The prime duty of the Government is to serve and protect the people. 
The Government may call upon the people to defend the State, and, in the 
fulfillment thereof, all citizens may be required, under conditions provided by 
law, to render personal military or civil service. 

In its General Provisions, it states the following 

SEC. 4. The Armed Forces shall be composed of a citizen armed force which 
shall undergo military training and serve, as may be provided by law. It shall 
keep a regular force necessary for the security of the State. 

SEC. 5. (1) All members of the armed forces shall take an oath or affirmation 
to uphold and defend this Constitution. 

(2) The State shall strengthen the patriotic spirit and the nationalist 
consciousness of the military, and respect for people's rights in the performance 
of their duty. 

(3) Professionalism in the armed forces and adequate remuneration and 
benefits of its members shall be a prime concern of the State. The armed forces 
shall be insulated from partisan politics. 

No member of the military shall engage directly or indirectly in any 
partisan political activity, except to vote. 

(4) No member of the armed forces in the active service shall, at any time, 
be appointed or designated in any capacity to a civilian position in the 
Government including government-owned or controlled corporations or any of 
their subsidiaries. 



58 



(5) Laws on retirement of military officers shall not allow extension of their 
service. 

(6) The officers and men of the regular force of the armed forces shall be 
recruited proportionately from all provinces and cities as far as practicable. 

(7) The tour of duty of the Chief of StafTof the armed forces shall not exceed 
three years. However, in times of war or other national emergency declared by 
the Congress, the President may extend such tour of duty. 

SEC. 6. The State shall establish and maintain one police force, which shall be 
national in scope and civilian in character, to be administered and controlled by 
a national police commission. The authority of local executives over the police 
units in their jurisdiction shall be provided by law. 

SEC. 7. The State shall provide immediate and adequate care, benefits, and 
other forms of assistance to war veterans of military campaigns, their surviving 
spouses and orphans. Funds shall be provided therefor and due consideration 
shall be given them in the disposition of agricultural lands of the public domain 
and, in appropriate cases, in the utilization of natural resources. 

The foregoing provisions emphasize the supremacy of civilian 
authority over the military by changing the concept and structure of the 
Armed Forces. As provided in the Constitution, the Armed Forces is to 
be composed of a citizen armed force, while maintaining a regular force 
for the security of the State, unlike in the National Defense Act which 
provided for a Regular and Reserve force. The present Constitution also 
prohibits military personnel in active service to serve in civilian positions 
by appointment or designation, confining the military to its function of 
maintaining national defense. 83 

Ithas likewise significantly reduced the Commander-in-Chief powers 
of the President by limiting the grounds and duration for the suspension 
of the privilege of writ of habeas corpus and the proclamation of martial 
law. Only invasion and rebellion, when the public safety requires it, can 
be invoked as a ground for such suspension or proclamation. It shall not 
exceed 60 days and may be revoked by Congress by a vote of at least a 
majority of all its members voting jointly in a regular or special session. 
The revocation cannot be set aside by the President and only Congress, 
upon initiative of the President, can extend it. Moreover, the Supreme 
Court may review the sufficiency of the factual basis of the suspension 
orproclamationoritsextension* This will prevent a partnership of the 
executive and the military leadership similar to what evolved during 



miliW t te™S i0n ? !° S ° Ught *° addreSS *• ^evances of the 
military. In terms of legislation, atotalof82billsandresolutionsrelated 



to the military were filed with the House of Representatives as of 30 
April 1990. As of 2 May 1990, a total of 141 of such bills and resolutions 
were filed with the Senate. But as of these dates, only six bills have 
become laws or parts of laws. 85 

Within the military, the main thrusts of internal reforms were to 
resurrect the AFP. After the first 100 days of the New Armed Forces of 
the Philippines (NAFP), Chief of Staff Lt Gen Ramos identified two 
objectives to be accomplished 

1. The implementation of wide ranging internal reforms aimed at restoring 
and reinforcing the credibility of a "reconstituted* and "reinvigo rated* 
AFP; improving the discipline, morale and welfare of its personnel; and 
increasing its operational effectiveness in the continuing battle against 
insurgency; and 

2. The implementation of strategic campaign plan code-named Mamamavan 
based on the three pillars of national reconciliation, security and 
development.' - 

Strategic/operational plan (Oplan) Mam am a van was the military's 
comprehensive approach to the insurgency problem. It was a three- 
pronged approach which included not only security and development but 
national reconciliation as well. It sought to involve the whole military 
in a coordinated effort against the insurgents. The plan also included 
the regionalization of troops in the sense that soldiers were assigned to 
their ethno-linguistic regions. 

The military also adopted several measures aimed at improving 
discipline, training, value formation, and morale among the troops. The 
value formation program included moral and spiritual development, 
socio-cultural affairs, and troop information and education (TI & E). 
Many of the soldiers' grievances were also taken into consideration. 
Overstaying generals were retired. Military pay scales were upgraded 
and an even policy of investigating human rights violations committed 
by both the military and the insurgents was developed. 

Structurally, internal reforms also aimed to bring the establishment 
back on track after years of disorientation. Key AFP commands were 
reorganized to ensure centralized planning and direction at the GHQ 
and to have decentralized operations and decision-making in the field. 
In 1987, the RUCs were abolished. In its place, the Area Unified 
Command (AUC) was established. Along this line, the Northern Luzon 
Command (NOLCOM) covering Regions I, II, and III, Southern Luzon 
Command (SOLCOM) covering Regions IV and V, SOUTHCOM for 



60 



Regions IX, X, XI, and XII, and the National Capital Region Defense 
Command '(NCRDC) were activated. The operational control over 
SOLCOM was transferred from GHQ to Headquarters, Philippine Army 
(HPA), effective 16 October 1987. However, GHQ retained administrative 
control over SOLCOM. The naval forces were also reorganized into 
naval districts to coincide with the AUC set-up. 87 In 1988, the Visayas 
Command (VISCOM) was activated to cover Regions VI, VII, and VIII. 88 

A number of formations and units were also either deactivated, 
reorganized or redesignated. The PSC has been downgraded to a NAPP 
- Wide Support and Separate Unit (NAFPWSSU) and is now called the 
Presidential Security Group (PSG). The Aviation Security Command 
(AVSECOM) which was responsible for the security of Ninoy Aquino 
when he arrived at the airport, has been renamed Philippine Air Force 
Security Command (PAFSECOM). The METROCOM has been renamed 
Capital Regional Command (CAPCOM). 89 

The NAFP also announced a campaign to purge its ranks of 
undesirable personnel at the higher levels of command and in the 
provinces as part of its reform program. However, no formal evaluation 
of its effectiveness and comprehensiveness was made public. Instead, 
the NAFP remained faction-ridden. Despite a previous order to disband 
groups within the military, new ones were organized like the Guardian 
Centre Foundation, Inc, (GCFI) which was registered with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 18 April 1986 90 and the Young 
Officers' Union (YOU). Honasan is one of the incorporators of the GCFL 
Five of its other incorporators (Nicanor Cagurangan, Leonides 
Montehermoso, Oscar Arevalo, Rogelio Attunaga, and Agustin Tuncol) 
were also GBI incorporators. 91 The persistence of factions and other 
developments within the AFP leading to the staging of six coup attempts 
against the Aquino government will be discussed in Chapter IV. 

The foregoing discussion shows that political change and military 
transformation from 1966 to 1989 saw the expansion of the role of the 
military amid the weakening of political institutions brought by martial 
law and its aftermath. The popular opposition engendered by the 
assass^

CHAPTER m 67 



III 



THE ENVIRONMENT 
OF THE PHILIPPINE MILITARY 



Coups begin in the minds of men. Soldiers who launch coups have 
a particular state of mind — values, perceptions, attitudes, and 
expectations — that define coups as desirable and feasible. 

Chapter I notes that a military group must have both the occasion 
and the disposition to intervene in political affairs. Occasion refers to the 
opportunity or conditions which are favorable to staging the coup. 
Disposition refers to a combination of conscious motives and of a will or 
desire to act. Chapter II analyzes the transformation of the Philippine 
military in response to political changes in the country. 

This chapter takes a closer look at the economic, political, and 
foreign environment of the Philippine military. Environment refers to 
the surrounding conditions or forces that influence or modify the behavior 
of the military and its component units or individual members. 

In examining the coup environment, this chapter focuses on the 
specific environment of the December 1989 coup attempt. However, it 
is necessary to look into the general environment of the previous seven 
coup attempts as a series, and of the continuing occasion for military 
groups to attempt a grab for power. 

Two inseparable but distinct concepts of the environment are used 
—the idea of the "objective milieu," or the environment as it really is, and 
the idea of the "psych omilieu," or the environment as it is perceived by 
an individual or group. Thus, this chapter seeks to provide an objective 
interpretation of the landscape of the coup attempts and to describe the 
military's perception of that environment. Necessarily, the psych omilieu 
is an approximation of the objective milieu and is distorted to some 
extent. 



68 



Some psychomilieus are more accurate than others. Regardless of 
their accuracy, however, men act on the basis of their psychomilieus. 
Whether they are in fact right or wrong, military groups who believe 
coups are right and have a high chance of success will continue launching 
them, until the consequences of their actions tell them otherwise. 

The presentation of the milieus, objective and psycho, of the Philippine 
military begins with an overview of the socialization process through 
which the specific psychomilieu of Filipino military officers are formed. 
This is in Section A. The objective economic, political, and foreign 
environments of the military identifying the specific factors that may 
have induced a predisposition among military men to launch coups are 
discussed in Sections B, C, and D. Finally, Section E provides a des- 
cription of the actual political predisposition of selected military officers, 
men, and their units. These predispositions are the closest this Report ' 
could get in conjecturing how strategic military units might act in the 
event of another coup attempt. These political orientations are telling 
indicators of how these units appreciate and interpret the environment 
as being conducive or not conducive to military intervention in government 
and politics. 

A. The Socialization of Military Officers 

This section describes and analyzes the socialization process that 
shapes the contemporary Filipino soldier, identifying the factors that 
may influence his political orientation and predisposition towards coups. 
The data and analysis were generated by a study on military socialization 
engaged by the Fact-Finding Commission. 1 The study conducted in- 
depth interviews of 64 officers purposively, rather than randomly 
selected from different service units. 

The study also conducted in-depth interviews of key personnel from 
eight mi itary schools - the Philippine Military Academy (PMA), the 
Metropolitan Citizen Military Training Command (MCMTC), the AFP 
^UpS^ A ^ TRACOM), the Philippine Air Force Flying 
School (PAFFS), the Philippine Army Training Command (PATRACOM* 
the Naval Training Command (NTC), the Philippine Constabulary

CHAPTER m 69 



A.1. Socialization Factors 

Socialization is the process by which the behavior of members of a 
given society is shaped by other members of the society. More specifically, 
it is the way in which a member acquires a knowledge of the standards 
and rules that are required to function in a particular society. It involves 
behavioral conformity, the internalization of norms and values, and the 
development of more autonomous internal principles. 

A.1 .a. Personal Background and Cultural Influences 

Officers come from middle-class families. Many have relatives in 
the military. Their families tend to view the military positively. A 
military career is viewed by many families as a source of a free education 
and a secure lifetime job. 

As gathered from the interviews, stressed in the families of the 
officer-respondents are respect for authority, the value of education, 
discipline and loyalty, hardwork, cooperation, thrift, and Christian 
values — values that reflect those prevailing in Philippine culture as a 
whole. 

Additionally, Philippine society at large teaches the future soldier 
more authoritarianism, strengthening the predisposition learned at 
home. The future soldier growing up in Philippine society learns to view 
his world in terms of personal relationships. This is carried over to his 
view of leadership. Personality traits as well as personal relationships 
with the leader are emphasized. 

The recruit into the military begins formal military training with 
certain predispositions from his home background and from the culture 
at large. He views the military and a military career favorably and 
expects positive outcomes from his joining the military. The cultural 
traitsjust discussed interact with the norms of the military establishment. 

Al.b. Philippine Military Academy and 
Other Military Schools 

There are selected subjects in all regular courses that are politically 
relevant. Specifically, these are Civil Military Operations, Military 
Justice (which includes Human Rights), Insurgency, History and 
institution, Socio-Humanistic subjects at the PMA, and the 
Management-Leadership subjects at the CGSC. 



70 



More than half of the subjects in all regular courses are combat- 
oriented and teach the soldier how to win in battle. The teachers are 
Tactical Officers. Ideally, the best faculty members for these subjects 
would be those who are in the field and who excel because of their 
military skills, moral integrity, and constitutional orientation. This is 
because personal values are unconsciously but effectively passed on to 
the student during the highly-charged war game experiences in training 
camps. 

But such "good" military leaders seldom teach in training schools 
because their commands need them in the field and refuse to let them go. 
Moreover, military culture tends to look down on teaching duties as 
assignments for weaklings, old officers or ineffective ones, and the career 
advancement incentives are lower for training assignments and higher 
for field assignments ("Invisible" income from other assignments may 
also not be available in a school setting). 

Almost all military training experiences are physically and 
intellectually isolated from civilian life. This results in a psychological 
gap between military men and civilians. Intense bonding takes place 
among cadets, a function presumably of hazing and a very tough plebe 
year. But this bonding combined with military-civilian separation 
merely serves to build discomfort, suspicion, and, ultimately, group 
conflict between these sectors. 

The training centers of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) 
teach students that the primary task of the military is to fight the 
enemy — the communists. An ti -communist sentiment (oddly, not pro- 
democracy sentiment) becomes inculcated in the minds of the student. 
Such strong anti-communist feelings may actually lead to the appeal of 
rightist authoritarian rule which coups represent. 

Although PMA barracks are immaculately neat and the honor code 
is drummed into their minds for four years, there are few opportunities 
for the cadet to freely and spontaneously express what he is thinking or 
feeling The most rewarded phrase in camp is "Sir, yes Sir!." Thus, the 
formation of consciousness and conscience is highly external with little 
attempt at interiority . And this is done during the highly impressionistic 
age between 17 and 22 years. 

Such an arrangement produces its desired results when the 
environment is highly structured. But placed in situations where no 
clear-cut behavior is defined by an authority, the external-based 
con science may not function adequately. In the field, circumstances are 



CHAPTER m 71 



unpredictable and are not clearly right or wrong. More so in coups d'etat, 
when multiple authorities demand obedience. 

A.1.C The Military Career 

The main reasons for joining the military are glamor and prestige of 
the military, influence of relatives, desire to become pilots and ship 
navigators, economic need, and patriotism. The typical career path 
follows a cycle — 

TRAINING -> FIELD ASSIGNMENT STAFF ASSIGNMENT -+ TRAINING 

although this is not always implemented properly as some stay too long 
or too short in an assignment. Field assignments are consistently viewed 
as more desirable than staff assignments. 

The rewards and punishments system within the military as an 
organization is a function of the rewards and punishments system 
applied to the military by its governmental, political, and economic 
environment. For instance, room for promotions depends on the military's 
share of the national budget. The internal system of rewards and 
punishment in the military is governed by the Articles of War, the hiring 
policy and guidelines, the traditions of the unit, and the policy of the 
Commanding Officer. 

According to the respondents, officers are rewarded for gallantry, 
bravery, honesty, dedication to duty, and excellent performance on the 
job. They are punished for violations of the Articles of War, unnecessary 
violence, involvement in coup attempts, immorality, and failure to 
perform one's duty. Their reactions to the system are mixed; half views 
the system of rewards and punishments as generally effective, while the 
other half claims that the system is poorly implemented and the system 
of rewards and punishments is ineffective. 

The top characteristics respondents admire in military leaders are: 
being principled (fair, straight, honest); disciplinarian/"™ nonsense 
man ; decisive but fatherly; very knowledgeable/intellectual/analytical; 
and "action man". 

The most mentioned shortcomings of military leadership are: 
involvement in or serving the interests of politicians; absence of 
coordination among themselves; indecisiveness/inconsistency; improper 
implementation of the reward and punishment system; abusiveness/ 



72 



leniency; being out of touch with his men; complacency; being misinformed; 
and, involvement in graft and corruption/materialism. 

Aside from co-workers and their families, the officers are closest to 
their classmates with whom they train. Because of that special bond, 
classmates influence their decisions, sympathies, and attitudes. , 

The respondents were asked to rate the military on prestige, power, 
competence, honesty, support to civilian government, and morale of 
soldiers for three different periods upon joining the military, ten years 
ago, and today. They give most favorable ratings for the period when 
they joined the military and the least favorable ratings today. PA 
officers give the lowest ratings. Junior officers give lower ratings than 
senior officers. The lowest ratings are for morale, prestige, and honesty. 

The pre-martial law years are viewed positively as productive years. 
The first years of martial law are also viewed positively as years of order 
and discipline. But its later years are seen as the country's and the 
military's worst. The assassination of Ninoy Aquino is perceived as the 
greatest blunder of the Marcos government. 

The February 1986 events are viewed differently by the respondents. 
One group views them positively as the height of people power and the 
prestige of the AFP. Another group views them negatively as being 
motivated by vested interests of military leaders and leading to instability 
because they started the series of coup attempts. The recent coup 
attempts are viewed as stemming from valid issues but using the wrong 
means. 

The literature on the Philippine military obtained and reviewed 
by the study suggest a military mind peculiar to the profession. This 
military mind views conflict as part of human history and only the build 
up of arms can prevent war. There is emphasis on the threats to security 
particularly from the communists. 

A.2. The Military Socialization Process 

The young recruit brings into military school the authoritarian and 
personalistic values of Philippine culture. Military school has a strong 
and lasting impact on the young recruit. Through the formal program 
of instruction in school, he acquires knowledge and skills needed by an 
educated man and a competent professional soldier. He learns the 
military code which emphasizes discipline, honor, and courage. He is 
taught to be a good leader by first being a good follower. 



CHAPTER HI 73 



Through the increased number of social science courses, he broadens 
his socio-political awareness. This is enhanced by the political atmosphere 
in the rest of society as well as by key historical events. At the PMA, the 
young cadet experiences violence and aggression through the practice of 
hazing. He also learns to use arms, fulfilling what is probably part of 
most Filipino males' fantasies. The authoritarian values he brought 
with him into the military school are further strengthened by the 
authoritarian culture in the military. In school, he becomes very close 
to his classmates and the rest of the young men with whom he goes 
through the rigors of training. Intense loyalties are formed. Through 
special rituals and ceremonies, a strong identification with the military 
establishment is developed and the y oungrecruit is proud to be a soldier. 

AJJ. Seasons in a Military Career 

After training, the graduate is commissioned and begins his military 
career. Life in the military has its high points and low points, but 
whether up or down, the socialization process continues and the young 
officer faces a lifetime of exposure to such socializing agents as the 
military culture, role models, peer influence, reward and punishment, 
organizational climate, and historical events in the country. 

The military code continues to be held up as an ideal. Authoritarian 
values continue to be reinforced and personalistic values are introduced 
as it becomes apparent that personal loyalties operate beneath the 
objective system. Out in the real world, the young officer comes face to 
ace with the imperfections of the institutions he has committed himself 
to protect with his life. He discovers that some of the leaders he is bound 
bydutytoobeyhavefeetofclay. Soon enough he finds out that the career 
he had selected partly because of its status and economic perks had in 
tact promised more than it could deliver. There is demoralization and 
disillusionment. 

But through his disappointment and in some cases even through his 
own betrayal of these ideals, the officer seems to retain clear expectations 
or what a professional officer should be, as well as the responsibilities of 
military leadership. In a sense, he retains a certain degree of idealism. 

His military career continues the socialization process began in 

nlT ^ 0fflCer reacts t0 events in the country, particularly those 
nvoivmg the military. The martial law years, the assassination of 
Aqinno, the EDSA People Power Revolt (EDSA Revolt), and the 
ecent coup attempts all contributed to this process. The problems in the 



74 



country and the government's continued difficulty in solving them 
induce a belief that military intervention might be necessary. 

Throughout his career, the officer retains close ties with his classmates 
through regular reunions and get-togethers. Classmates are a sounding 
board for ideas and a source of support. Given the risk of being killed 
in action, class unity becomes even more important as survivors usually 
adopt the family of their slain classmates. 

A.4. Military Socialization as a Factor 
in Coup Participation 

Having described the military socialization process and the impact 
of military schooling and career on the young recruit, one asks: What 
factors in the military socialization process may contribute to an officer's 
politicization, i.e., his predisposition to participate in a coup d'etat? 

The socialization process broadens the cadets' perspectives about 
society and politics making him politicalized. Politicalization is the 
process whereby one's socio-political awareness is developed. There are 
several hypotheses on the factors that heighten both politicization, one 
form of which is the predisposition to launch coups, and politicalization . 
These hypotheses are synthesized from the interviews and analysis of 
data obtained in the study. 

A.4.a. The Politicalized Cadet Hypothesis 

Some believe that the curriculum at the PMA contributes to the 
politicalization of the cadet and this politicalization leads to participation 
in coup attempts. While an analysis of the program of instruction does 
.reveal a number of courses where political discussions may take place, 
it is also suggested that faculty influence is a contributing factor to 
political orientation. The most important factor is the general envi- 
ronment in the country itself, i.e., the growing politicalization and 
activism of students and citizens which make politicization in the PMA 
not inconceivable. No matter how much the PMA connection appears as 
a contributory factor, PMA experience is still not a sufficient condition 
for participation in attempted coups. 

A.4.b. The Disgruntled Officer Hypothesis 

The poor organizational climate in which officers operate and the 
demoralization of the military are often blamed for the coup attempts. 



CHAPTER HI 75 



A.4.C. The Power-Hungry Officer Hypothesis 

According to this explanation, the career paths of coup plotters 
which led them to the corridors of power during the Marcos years as well 
as the role they played in the EDSA Revolt are factors that lead to coup 
participation. These officers believe that they succeeded in grabbing 
power in 1986 and therefore, should be able to do it again. 

A.4.d. The Idealistic Young Officer Hypothesis 

This explanation recognizes that many officers still value the ideals 
they learned early in their military careers and thus, the disillusionment 
with corruption and incompetence both in the military as well as civilian 
leadership leads them to launch coups in order to save the country. 
These officers and a number of their peers believe that coups are justified 
under extreme conditions. 

A.4.e. Problem Personality Hypothesis 

Some of the known coup plotters manifest definite personality 
disturbances that may partly explain their participation in the attempted 
coups. Persons with high power needs, who are narcissistic and have 
sociopathic tendencies (psychological patterns thathave been established 
for some plotters) are prime candidates for coups. While a systematic 
psychological study of all the coup plotters has not been done, it is 
reasonable to conclude that personality problems contribute to the 
explanation. 

A^. Military Socialization and the Coup Environment 

While these factors all contribute to a predisposition towards coups 
d'etat, none of these factors working alone or even all of these factors 
working in combination can explain coup participation. The study 
suggests that military socialization factors by themselves cannot explain 
coup-related behavior. A politicalized military will not necessarily 
attempt to overthrow the government. Military socialization produces 
a politicalized officer who then interacts with the "coup environment" 
existing in Philippine society as described in Chapter II and subsequent 
sections of this chapter. Coups d'etat are a product of that interaction. 

Using force field terminology, the coup environment consists of 
anvingforces or those factors which push the politicized soldier towards 
coups d'etat and restraining forces or factors that keep him from 
participatingin coups. Some of the main drivingforces in the environment 



76 



are (a) the criticism hurled against the Aquino government and the 
present military leadership, (b) pressure from leaders and peers to join 
themin support of coups, (c) the fact that past coup plotters have not been 
seriously punished for their crimes, and (d) the poor quality of military 
life. 

The main restraining forces in the environment are (a) the strong 
public opinion against coups, (b) the strength of the constitutionalist 
armed forces who will defend the government against attempts to 

overthrow it, (c) the popularity of the present government, and (d) the job 
security and other benefits of a military job that will be lost to the officer 
and his family should the coup fail. 

B. The Economic Environment 2 

The previous section suggests that personal background and cultural 
influences, military training, and career patterns, are factors that may 
help predispose military officers to intervene in government and politics 

However,itemphasizesthatmilitarysocializationfactorsbythemselves 
cannot explain coup-related behavior. Atbest, the military socialization 
process produces a politicized officer who then interacts with the "coup 
environment". When a critical mass is politicized by the interaction, a 
coup happens. 

Violent political events have often been predicated on adverse 
economic conditions. One popular hypothesis is Davies's "J" Curve - 
rising expectations and gratifications, if followed by a period of a short, 
sharp reversal in gratifications, create a wide gap between what people 
want and what they get, then the probability of revolution (or other 
violent event) increases greatly. Conflict develops in a society when 
major segments acutely suffer this sudden "subjective* deprivation,

» the common state of mind: the profound frustration that develops 
when the environment in the form of culture, society, and government 
denies the opportunity for basic needs to get fulfilled < *^ ment 



chapter m 77 



In applying these insights to the Philippine coup environment, we 
may hypothesize that 

1. The probability of the occurrence of an intervention (military or 
otherwise) in government rises with a decline in human welfare. 

2. The probability of success of such an intervention approaches 
certainty as the indicators of welfare sink to a critical level. 

People may differ in their opinion of what constitutes a critical level. 
"Critical" can be defined in two ways — an inability to meet the most 
basic needs, as posited above, or popular dissatisfaction even when there 
is an improvement in the objective economic situation. The latter would 
not necessarily be inconsistent with the relative deprivation hypothesis 
since actual conditions in reference to expectations, and not to previous 
conditions, can also result in dissatisfaction. Certainly, the EDSARevolt 
created extremely high expectations among the people, especially in 
Metro Manila, which is the immediate environment of the coups. 

Usually, however, a serious economic recession hastens the formation 
of a consensus that a critical level has been reached. 

By way of a test of the above proposition, the behavior of some 
macroeconomic variables that correlate well with "human comfort* are 
examined. Welfare is essentially multi-dimensional, and may include 
items like per capita income, energy consumption, nutritional status, 
and political freedom. The discussion in this section abstracts from many 
of these dimensions of welfare. 

B.l. Some Macroeconomic Indicators of Welfare 

Macroeconomic variables are analyzed for the two years preceding 
the EDSA Revolt in 1986 and the three years preceding the December 
1989 coup. The EDSA Revolt and the December 1989 coup are of interest 
because one attained its goal of changing the government and the other 
aid not. Were there significant differences in the behavior of these 
macroeconomic variables that would help explain the differences in 
political outcomes? 

Table IIM shows the behavior of real gross national product (GNP), 

jjjj rate of real GNP ' and the inflation rate for the p eriod 1984 to

In 1983, the balance of payments difficulties of the country came to 
a head and the government was forced to negotiate a standby credit 
arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), while the 
exchange rate collapsed. The conditionalities agreed upon with the IMF 
called for austerity measures that led to a contraction of real output in 
1984 - 1985, the first in the postwar history of the Philippines. 

The negative to poor aggregate performance of the economy in 1984 
and 1985 can readily be seen in terms of the level and growth rate of real 
GNP, and of the inflation rate. In 1984, the economy receded with a 
negative growth rate in real GNP of 5.5 percent. The recession persisted 
in 1985, as real GNP further declined by 4.12 percent. With respect to 
the general price level, the inflation rate in 1984 rose to 50.3 percent, 
surpassing even the average rate of the inflation-ridden 1970s. In 1985, 
the inflation rate moderated somewhat to 23. 1 percent. 

The above trends can be contrasted with the behavior of the same 
macroeconomic variables in 1987, 1988, and 1989. The year 1989 is 
included because the attempted coup d'etat took place in December 1989' 
when it was too late in the year for the overall performance of the 
economy to be adversely affected. 

In 1986, the economy experienced a turnaround with a modest 1.86 * 
percent growth rate in real GNP. I n i 987 and 1988. however, the 
economy grew by 5.8 percent and 6.7 percent respectively While the 
economy s momentum slowed down somewhat in 1989, it still registered 
a respectable growth rate of 5.7 percent. Concerning the behavior of the 



CHAPTER III 79 



price level, one notes that the inflation rate was rising from 1987 to 1989 
— from 3.8 percent in 1987, to 8.8 percent in 1988, and 10.6 percent in 
1989. Although the inflation rate hit the double-digit mark in 1989, it 
was still low compared to the 23 percent inflation rate in 1985. 

Looking at the behavior of output and the general price level two 
years before the 1986 EDSA Revolt and three years before the 1989 
attempted coup d'etat, the contrast is quite marked. In line with the 
proposition of the political economy model presented above, the chance 
of success of the 1989 attempt was relatively slim. The segment of the 
military that staged the 1989 attempt failed to build a critical mass of 
civilian support. In 1986, a massive coalition supportive of the objective 
to overthrow the Marcos government responded to the call for a popular 
uprising. 

Additional indicators of economic welfare are shown in Table III-2. 6 
The figures shed further light on the difference in political results 
between the 1986 EDSA Revolt and 1989 coup attempt. The figures 
show personal consumption expenditures ofhouseholds and compensation 
of employees, entrepreneurial and property income of persons, both 
adjusted for the inflation rates. Personal consumption expenditures, a 
component of aggregate demand, is close to 75 percent of GNP. Taking 
it from the income side, compensation of employees and other income of 
persons is slightly above 75 percent of national income. These two 
measures correlate highly and positively with human comfort. Again, 
the trends that emerge from these figures are a decline from 1984 to 
1985, as against a steady rise from 1987 to 1988, followed by a mild 
slowdown in 1989.

In terms of job creation, 1.2 million new jobs were generated in 1987 
and 1.1 million jobs in 1988. The trend dipped to 700,000 new jobs in 
1989 but continued to be significantly positive. Poverty incidence also 
dropped from 59 percent in 1985 to 49.5 percent in 1988 with the 
National Capital Region, where the coup attempts were concentrated, 
experiencing one of the highest improvements. 

Based on the objective statistics, it seems curious why a segment of 
the military thought that their coup attempt in 1989 would receive 
popular support. Going by the behavior of the macroeconomic variables 
described above, the coup plotters mighthave thought that the slowdown 
in the growth rates of these macroeconomic measures was misery- 
inducing enough to push civilian groups to support their cause. Obviously, 
it was an erroneous assumption, evident from the fact that civilian 
groups did not rally to their call. 

Their miscalculation may have been influenced by several events in 
late 1989. As also mentioned in the discussion of the political environment, 
there was in fact some restiveness among the people. A legislated 
minimum wage increase in June 1989 was widely criticized by industry, 
particularly small and medium-scale Filipino enterprises, at the same 
time that labor was protesting the inability of government to enforce 
compliance with minimum wage laws by a large number of enterprises. 
Petroleum prices increased in August and November 1989, along with 
transport fares, resulting in inflationary pressures on prices of basic 
commodities. Students protested tuition fee hikes, government w orkers 
were aggrieved by the Salary Standardization Law, farmers clamored 
for an increase in the palay subsidy, thousands of commuters could not 
get a ride to and from work. There were threats of Welgang Bayan 
(general strike) and jeepney drivers and teachers engaged in selective 
labor demonstrations. There were also frequent power outages in the 
third quarter of 1989. ^ , 

These were on top of unrest in the streets by a broad cross-section of 
Philippine society not due to economic but to political reasons: Marcos 
loyalists wantingto bring back thebody of Marcos, and military elements 
complaining of bad treatment by the civilian leadership. The proposed 
PC-INP bill also agitated the military top brass of the PC because it 
created uncertainty and morale problems in the ranks. 

The resulting price increases and sectoral agitation did not, however, 
result in serious enough economic slowdown in the aggregate, which 
could have meant a drastic fall in human comfort, at least by thetime of 



CHAPTER HI 81 



the coup attempt in December 1989. In other words, the critical level 
was not reached. 

This section shows that while economic misery marked the period 
before February 1986, the same could not be said for the period before 
December 1989, when the economy was experiencing output growth and 
relatively mild inflation. While some groups may have been bypassed by 
the growth in the economy, their economic difficulties were not sufficient 
to induce a critical mass of civilians to support the forces aimed at 
overthrowing the government headed by President Aquino. 

B.2. The Present Economic Situation 
as a Coup Environment 

However, given disquieting current trends in the economy (i.e., 
growth rate, inflation rate, interest rate, trade balance, budget deficit), 
and the domestic economic reverses resulting from the drought and 
recent massive earthquake, appropriate government policies to address 
critical areas of economic performance assume added importance. 

The government has to institute measures at a time when sectors 
which have been very supportive of it have become openly critical of two 
key economic policies, namely, influential members of the church 
hierarchy with respect to the management of the external debt, and the 
business community with respect to the restructuring of tariffs. The 
government has had to backtrack on the implementation of tariff reform 
in the face of the criticism and of a probable rebuff from Congress. 

That task is made more difficult by unfavorable international 
developments — external resources are less easily obtainable as the 
industrial countries pay greater attention to the needs of Eastern 
Europe at a time when the total available foreign aid is declining, and 
trade protectionism continues to rise. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait will 
alsohave tremendous adverse repercussions for the Philippine economy. 
It has disrupted overseas contract workers' output and earnings, reduced 
further deployment opportunities of contract workers, and raised the 
cost of oil. The expected increase in domestic oil prices will trigger other 
price increases and labor demands for wage increases, unless the 
government can mitigate the impact with a comprehensive fiscal reform 
program. 



Some experts hazard a guess that a recession as severe as the one in 
4 - 1985 may give rise to a predisposition by a significant portion of 
civilian population to support, or at least not actively resist, another 



82 



attempt at military intervention. While the deterioration in economic 
indicators has become more pronounced than at the time of the December 
1989 coup attempt, with real per capita income declining in the second 
quarter of 1990 for the first time since 1987, a balance of payments crisis 
and a recession of that severity are still avoidable depending on how 
promptly and effectively the government handles the situation. 

C. The Political Environment 7 

The previous section compared the economic environment preceding 
the February 1986 events with that of the December 1989 coup attempt. 
It showed that in terms of "relative deprivation" there was no basis to 
warrant an expectation on the part of the coup plotters that their 
attempt would receive massive popular support. Contrary to their 
perception, the objective economic situation, despite some deterioration 
by the end of 1989, could not have been a real cause for launching the 
coup. The resti veness of various sectors was misread by the coup plotters 
and served to influence their timing. 

Independent of the economic environment, there were other variables 
that may have influenced the behavior of the coup plotters for the 
December 1989 attempt as well as the six others launched against the 
Aquino administration. These were the state and dynamics of national 
leadership, government, politics, and political performance. They 
constituted the political environment of the coup, which is discussed 
next, 

C.l. An Auspicious Start 

The period between February 1986 when Corazon C. Aquino was 
ushered into power and December 1989 when the latest and most serious 
coup attempt was mounted, is vital in getting a sense of the political 
climate surrounding the repeated attempts to destabilize the Aquino 
government. In spite of the failure of her major initiatives in the first 
year of her administration to forge peace pacts with the Communist 
Party of the Philippines/New People's Army (CPP/NPA) and the Moro 
National Liberation Front (MNLF), two developments in 1987 augured 
well for her fledgling government. The first was the overwhelming 
ratification of the new Constitution in February, which strengthened 
the legitimacy of her government. The second was the May national 
elections, the first credible elections since Marcos placed the country 
under martial law rule in 1972. The May elections resulted in 
overwhelming majorities for the candidates for the Senate and the 
House of Representatives who were personally endorsed by President 



CHAPTER ra 83 



Aquino and the coalition she headed. She had a convincing mandate to 
govern. 

C.2. A Beleaguered Government 

Despite that mandate, the most important feature of the political 
environment of the Aquino administration has been what Ninoy Aquino 
predicted — whoever became president would face a most unenviable 
task. Philippine history has been a parade of no less than ten crises 
administrations from Emilio Aguinaldo to Ferdinand E. Marcos that 
have failed to satisfactorily contain or resolve the outstanding social, 
economic, political, and foreign policy crises of their time. The accu- 
mulated crises of the past have conjoined to constitute the most severe 
test of any Filipino political leadership. On top of age-old problems of 
poverty, gross inequities of income, wealth, and political power, and 
graft and corruption exacerbated by the excesses of the Marcos admi- 
nistration, the country has to contend with a foreign debt burden of 
staggering proportions and the problem of governance inherent in a 
newly-restored democracy. 

The gravest threat to the survival of the Aquino government has 
been the coup attempts. Almost from the start, the repeated attempts 
by military groups to wrest power from the Aquino government have 
diverted its attention, time, energy, and resources and sidelined efforts 
at a systematic resolution of the myriad problems of the nation. 

All the coups failed because, among other reasons, they were lacking 
in political strategy and support. The plotters apparently expected a 
spontaneous display of "People Power" against the Aquino government 
which never materialized. The August 1987 coup attempt was deliberately 
timed to ride on Left-oriented protest demonstrations and strikes against 
the Aquino government's inaction on agrarian reform and its decision to 
increase petroleum prices. The December 1989 coup followed a strike of 
jeepney drivers demanding a fuel price rollback, a teachers' strike for 
higher pay, and a mass walk-out of hospital workers. Such restiveness 
turned out to be insufficient to ignite popular support for a coup d'etat. 
The plotters miscalculated the sentiments of the people against military 
interventionism. 

What could have emboldened this miscalculated adventurism are 
two beliefs shared by some segments in the Armed Forces, namely: that 
the Aquino administration is too soft on the communist insurgency, and 
that the military handed power to the Aquino administration in February 
1986. 



84 



To counter this perception, President Aquino visibly hardened her 
approach to the insurgency problem, in her words, "unsheathing the 
sword of war" and giving more prominence to the military aspect of her 
total war strategy. The coups helped pull the Aquino government 
incrementally to the right, -through successive cabinet reorganizations 
and policy adjustments. It endorsed the organization of armed civilian 
anti-communist vigilantes in both rural and urban areas. In February 
1988, the Secretary of National Defense, Rafael Ileto, was removed over 
a disagreement within the military regarding the counter-insurgency 
approach. 

The people did not lend support to the second belief, as they 
applauded the dismissal of Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile in the 
wake of the "God Save The Queen" coup attempt, who had been demanding 
a power-sharing arrangement on the basis of that belief. Despite his 
initial popularity after the EDSA Revolt, Enrile barely made it as a 
senator in the May 1987 congressional elections. 

The people supported the government throughout the various coups 
that have been mounted against it. However, it seems the government 
has mismanaged each post-coup situation and failed to capitalize on its 
reservoir of mass support. 

For example, after renegade Lt Col Gregorio Honasan was caught in 
November 1987, he was put on a Navy ship in Manila Bay with guards 
who eventually helpedhim escape in April 1988. On hindsight, President 
Aquino's handling of Honasan now appears to be a case of reluctance to 
confront a problem squarely. As Commander-in-Chief, she could have 
ordered a court-martial for Honasan. However, Malacanang chose to 
deal cautiously with Honasan, saying the government did not want to 
make a martyr of him and other rebels, nor did it want to antagonize a 
segment of the military. The December 1989 coup attempt is partly the 
resultoftheindecision of government to deal firmly with the participants 
of earlier coup attempts, despite massive popular support for such an 
approach. 

The coup attempts periodically rein vigorated the Aquino presidency. 
The cause-oriented I and centrist groups, despite their increasing dis- 
appointment with President Aquino's temporizing over socio-economic 
reforms, came out strongly after each coup attempt in defense of the 
Aquino government and the democratic institutions and space it restored. 

However the Aquino government has not effectively consolidated 
and mobilized its popular support on a systematic and long-term basis. 



CHAPTER HI 85 



Hence, her presidency has been "invisible" to supporters who needed a 
focus for political participation and wanted to see decisive action on 
msgor governmental efforts. She would time and again encourage the 
formation of grassroots organizations, but would not follow through with 
a major governmental effort, until June 1990 when she finally launched 
Kabisig. 

President Aquino also sought to draw from foreign, governments' 
support that the EDSA Revolt generated. She immediately set out to 
visit ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries, the UN 
Headquarters, the United States, and Japan within her first year in 
office. She later visited China and Europe. The US government and the 
American people were clearly the biggest potential source of assistance. 

There is a growing perception that the Aquino government has 
become less of a rallying point for post-Marcos reforms in the areas of 
human rights, participatory democracy, agrarian reform, urban land 
reform, and the establishment of a new moral order. It is claimed that 
her last two years would just be a matter of survival, with her accomplish- 
ments in re-establishing democratic institutions, constitutional govern- 
ment, and the restoration of democratic space serving as the staging 
point for more comprehensive reforms by the next administration. This 
seems consistent with her own concept of a transitional leadership from 
a dictatorship to a full-fledged democracy. 

C.3. De-Marcosiflcation 

One of the tasks of the Aquino administration was to remove the 
pernicious practices of the Marcos years in society, the economy, and in 
government. The effort included recovering the hidden wealth of the 
Marcoses and their cronies, prosecuting them, neutralizing Marcos 
politicians and civilian forces, and dismantling the authoritarian 
machinery and institutions built by Marcos for more than a decade. 
There have been significant accomplishments in such areas as the 
abolition of monopolies in certain major commodities, re-direction of 
government financial institutions, and privatization of some government 
assets. 

On the other hand, the President has not been very successful in 
consolidating her political base through a political party or movement. 
This may be due to her desire to avoid criticism that she was copying 
Marcos's tactics. She understood that she had to get her people into key 
national and local governmental positions, ousting Marcos loyalists, but 



86 



she has not ensured, either by selection or indoctrination, that they 
share her vision for the government and the nation. 

C.4. Democratization 

Domestic politics in the last several years have also been characterized 
by a continuing process of democratization. The President commissioned 
the drafting of a new Constitution and called for a plebiscite to ratify it. 
Upon its overwhelming approval by the people, the first free, honest, and 
credible congressional, local, and barangay elections in a decade were 
conducted separately. 

The new Constitution captures the idealism of the EDSA Revolt in 
both domestic and foreign policy. It establishes an agenda that is more 
far-reaching than what a conservative Congress is prepared to legislate. 
The Constitution also circumscribes the Executive within stringent 
safeguards against a return to authoritarianism. The resulting structure 
is a delicate system of checks and balances that requires a high degree 
of statesmanship in the country's political leadership. 

After EDSA, the mass media quickly blossomed under the restored 
democratic atmosphere, with national daily newspapers alone increasing 
to more than 25. While a number of newspapers clearly maintain a high 
level of social responsibility, there is a debate about some of the others 
as to whether they have deteriorated into the sensationalist, licentious 
pre-martial law genre. The same can be said about radio. While many 
practice responsible journalism, there are commentators who concentrate 
on dramatic political tidbits and still others who deliberately undermine 
the government. 

In the free market of information where government has often been 
ineffective if not reluctant in speaking for and explaining itself, it has 
become the victim of propaganda offensives by its enemies — coup 
plotters, insurgents, foreign interventionists, secessionists, and the 
political opposition. 

However, on balance, the Constitution has been strengthened by the 
coups and the continuing insurgencies thathave challenged it. Democra- 
tization has brought democratic space to Filipinos, even though the elite, 
both old and new, have been quick to corner its benefits in and out of 
government, possibly preempting wider socio-economic reform.

C.5. Return of Traditional Politics 

The first two elections under the Aquino government were a testi- 
mony to the durability, if not of the traditional elites, then certainly of 
traditional styles of political support and mobilization. 

Traditional politicians have been cited by coup plotters and by 
communist insurgents alike as a major reason for their actions. Even 
the administration itself, in launching Kabisig, hit a raw nerve among 
the politicians in Congress when the movement was depicted as a 
movement to bypass the "trapos" (meaning traditional politicians, but 
the contraction literally means "dirty rags"). 

It must be recalled, however, that alliances with some traditional 
politicians [even those who belonged to the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan 
(KBL) and were loyal to Marcos] were resorted to by the allies of the 
Aquino administration in a bid to win congressional and local posts and 
build a nationwide political machinery in 1987 and 1988. 

In the final analysis, the return of traditional politics may be traced 
to the lack of opportunities for various elites to surface during the Marcos 
regime. The recruitment process for the "best and the brightest" in 
various fields was disrupted and corrupted. It is only under the demo- 
cratic space created under the new administration that the normal 
process of renewal of societal elites, in government and politics, business 
and industry, the military, and perhaps also in the arts and culture, has 
resumed. The results of this renewal process are not yet apparent, 
because of the early lead and positioning the traditional elites have 
taken. 

C.6. Break-up of the Ruling Coalition 

The EDSA revolt brought together a broad spectrum of interests, 
including segments of the military, united by their outrage of Marcos. 
From this diverse array of forces was drawn the political leadership for 
the post-Marcos government, led by President Aquino. This incoming 
ruling coalition in the Aquino government was studded with prominent 
erstwhile Marcos cabinet members and politicians, side by side with 
veteran political leaders who fought Marcos and the "best and the 
brightest" non-political types. Their main challenge was to revive 
democracy and restore basic freedoms to Filipinos. They assumed that 
the factors that bound them together in the so-called "rainbow coalition" 
were sufficiently strong to overcome deep-seated disagreements on 



88 



social reform and economic policy. Unfortunately, much more is required 
of political leaders. 

Ruling elites usually possess a coherent structure, infused by a 
particular ideology. In Singapore, the ruling class is almost a homo- 
genous grouping of economic-minded followers of Lee Kuan Yew, who 
set the tone and direction for national development. In Thailand, one can 
predict that the ruling clique will come from the ranks of the military and 
bureaucracy, bound together by their elite status in society. In Malaysia, 
the United Malay National Organization (UMNO) elite will certainly 
dominate national political leadership. In Japan, the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP), and in Taiwan the Kuomintang are the predictable sources 
of the ruling elite. 

Elites in these countries think as one in moving their countries 
ahead. The ruling elite has a clear consensus indicative of a disciplined 
process of decision-making. 

This has not been the case with President Aquino's ruling coalition. 
Only after a few months, the deadly virus of Philippine politics — 
fractiousness — reemerged. The May 1987 elections further depleted 
the Aquino circle of advisers. In time, some of these former cabinet 
advisers would chart their own agenda, and while still loosely considered 
part of the coalition, they would have very little in common with the 
President. 

In fact, the appointing power of the President became a focus of 
politics between the executive and the legislative branches of government 
which included legislators who were clearly elected on the basis of the 
President's endorsement. President Aquino refused to subject some of 
her appointments and promotions to the review of the Congressional 
Commission on Appointments. She vetoed a bill delineating the powers 
of the Commission, and Congress threatened to override her veto. The 
controversy may be viewed as part of a larger effort to determine the 
appropriate sharing of policy-making powers by the legislative and 
executive branches of government. As played by some legislators, the 
game deteriorated into pure political grandstanding. 

The constant changes in the national leadership contributed to the 
political insecurity of the country in the two years separating the 1987 
and 1989 coup attempts. In some areas, such as land reform, there were 
changes just about every year. In terms of the economic agenda, the 
Central Bank would have one idea and NEDA, another. A third 
dimension would be contributed by the Department of Finance. This 



chapter m 89 



fragmentation was an indication that institutional coordination was 
lacking and no one was in firm control. 

But the fractiousness in government and politics is a price for 
democracy which often leads to a dilemma. Its essence is openness and 
accommodation. But without firm institutional moorings and a unifying 
political vision, this becomes sterile and even destructive, often leading 
to chaos. The ensuing turmoil in civilian politics is an invitation to 
military intervention. As Fr Joaquin Bernas sees it, "Once politics get 
into the military, the danger is that the military will get into politics." 8 
The ultimate result is a political polarization in society at the expense 
of national consensus and unity, and the danger of military adventurism. 



C.7. The Legislature 



The government under the 1987 Constitution places greater initiative 
for policy on the legislature compared to the previous dispensation. The 
powers of the Executive are significantly reduced. The adoption of the 
presidential form of government with broad constitutionally guaranteed 
civil, political, economic, and social rights of the people shifts the center 
of political gravity from the Executive to the Legislative. 

The people, however, continue to look to the President for major 
decisions affecting national life. Their expectations of the Presidency^ 
are too high, especially for an admittedly inexperienced even if charismatic 
leader such as President Aquino. For example, on agrarian reform, it 
did not sit well with the people that the President chose to shift the 
resolution of major issues to the incoming Congress. 

The state of confusion and lack of direction that has characterized 
the political situation is therefore attributable not only to the President's 
action or inaction, but also to the legislature's. The problems besetting 
the nation and specific sectors, such as the military, teachers, students, 
workers, farmers, and urban poor, are problems not only of implemen- 
tation, but of policy formulation and coordination between the Executive 
and the Legislative. Thus, the restiveness of the military might have 
slackened if numerous bills relating to the military had been passed 
promptly. 

Congress had never been rated highly by citizens in pre-martial law 
years. The new Congress in the Aquino Government was welcomed in 
July 1987 mainly because it completed, along with an independent 
judiciary and the restored civil liberties of the people, the return of the 
democratic system. It also looked promising because of the election of 



a significant number of so-called "n on -traditional politicians" which 
indicated a growing maturity of the electorate. But the new Congress is 
still predominantly conservative. 

It did not take long before the body's popularity began to decline 
precipitously. In September 1988, the House margin of satisfaction 
(percentage of very satisfied/satisfied minus percentage of dissatisfied/ 
very dissatisfied), according to a Social Weather Station (SWS) survey 
was +22 percent, which was healthy. That dipped to +8 percent in 
February 1989,decreasingby 14 percentage points. The Senate declined 
even more in satisfaction ratings. From +26 percent in September 1988, 
it fell by 21 percentage points to only +5 percent in February 1989. 9 

What accounts for the sudden drop for both chambers? The survey 
mentioned "sexcapades, imported Uzis, imported luxury cars, self- 
granted bonuses, new Congress building, and many more" as the 
reasons. These were no doubt reinforced by media reports which are easy 
to come by in exaggerated form. Because members of Congress are very 
visible, they are vulnerable to media exposure. It takes only one 
legislator to misbehave for the whole institution te be tainted. 

With barely two years left of the term of its present members, 
Congress may not be able to enact vital legislation to implement several 
provisions of the 1987 Constitution which require immediate action, 
such as its provisions on human rights and social justice, i.e., diffusion 
of wealth and political power. 

C.8. The National Leadership 

Upon assuming power in February 1986, President Aquino and her 
Cabinet, mostly newcomers to government service, had to formulate and 
oRentimes agonize over piecemeal policies, even as an expectant nation 
and an international audience demanded a comprehensive political and 
socio-economic blueprint. 

Not wanting to be dictatorial, President Aquino was reluctant to 
decree under the Freedom Constitution not only such a blueprint but 
also key policies despite the vast legislative power she held until the 
convening of Congress on the fourth Monday of July 1987 Instead she 
concentrated on restoring the democratic process, so she could imme- 
diately pass on to the new Congress the task of substantive policy- 
making. Thisdepartedfrompastpractice,consideringthatthePresident, 
even under the previous liberal democratic regime (1946 - 1972) prior to 



CHAPTER HI 91 



Marcos's authoritarian rule, usually set the tone of domestic and foreign 
policy. 

Her main decisions in her first two years in office were institution- 
oriented. Amidst threats to the survival of her government, she sought 
to restore democratic institutions and practices to the country. The 
democratic space she created, however, has encouraged the reemergence 
of the traditional elite and caused hopes for a new politics to recede. 
Without resolute government leadership in pursuing needed socio- 
economic reforms, the forces for the status quo have prevailed. 

The people's expectations for meaningful reforms remain high, 
despite the disappointments of the past four years. Innovative paths 
continue to be proposed by non-government organizations such as the 
peace process. 

On the other hand, while agreeing that the post-Marcos envi- 
ronment would not be easy, institutions, groups, and concerned indi- 
viduals have not adequately responded to the challenge of strengthening 
participatory democracy at the grassroots. This is particularly true at 
thebarangay level where presumably the ordinary citizens feel competent 
and willing to participate and express themselves as citizens. However, 
no frenzy of grassroots, community, village, or barangay organizing, 
discussing, and meeting has ensued since the EDSA Revolt. 10 

The centerpiece of the Aquino administration is purportedly the 
agrarian reform program. This program was projected to cost about $2.5 
billion over a five-year period. Doubts were widely expressed that the 
government would have the support of the landlords who demand the 
most in terms of cash settlement. The big question was whether they 
were willing to subordinate their short-term interest in favor of the 
nation's industrial future by accepting, say, bonds instead of cash. Given 
the reactionary nature of this elite, as validated by the nation's history, 
the answer would be negative. It was demonstrated by the House of 
Representatives' emasculation of the agrarian reform legislation. .Yet 
there was in sufficient public pressure for the legi slature to act otherwise. 
The emasculated Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law is as much the 
failure or default of grassroots organizations to mobilize for social 
reforms as it is a victory of traditional power groups. 

This state of affairs in the circles of power prompted Jaime Zobel 
de Ayala, a prominent industrialist and well-known Aquino supporter, 
to comment that "there must be anarchy in our blood." In essence, 
President Aquino was being left to govern alene. "Politicians, save a few, 



92 



seem to have forgotten that they are there to serve the people. They 
waste their time playing to the grandstands of their own creation. And 
often, we let ourselves be used as their cheering squad." 11 

In his analysis of the disarray in Aquino's administration, Zobel de 
Ayala castigatedhis fellow businessmen as well. "We have forgotten that 
our companies are more profitable than ever, principally because she has 
made it possible. . . In the meantime, the President stands by herself, 
dissected, criticized and crucified daily for all kinds of failings. And not 
enough are willing to come to her defense." 12 

C.9. The Bureaucracy 

Except for the top layer, the one-million-strong bureaucracy has 
essentially remained the same, despite the efforts of the Aquino Presi- 
dential Commission on Government Reorganization and the one-year 
purge of misfits from the bureaucracy authorized by the Freedom 
Constitution. The elimination of progressives from the top echelons of 
the bureaucracy, victims of compromise and horse trading, helped derail 
bureaucratic reforms. Bureaucratic corruption continued as existing 
networks of grafters and misfits were left untouched by the reorganization. 

C.10. Graft and Corruption 

President Aquino's image and character are one of integrity and 
uprightness. Since the time she decided to fight Marcos for the 
presidency, she has been on moral high ground. Within a year after heir 
accession to power, the government had filed 39 civil cases-with the 
Sandiganbayan involving 314 defendants headed by Marcos and his 
family. These cases were mostly for graft and corruption, theft, 
embezzlement, fraud, and other crimes allegedly committed by Marcos 
and his cronies. 

But President Aquino's moral ascendancy has not filtered down to 
the lower reaches of the bureaucracy and to other branches of the 
government where corruption remains. Rumors about the questionable 
activities of certain presidential relatives began to circulate. In her 
official family, one of the most damaging scandals was the Garchitorena 
case at the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR). Smuggling of all 
kinds of commodities, including guns, was unabated during this period. 
A member of the House of Representatives was caught smuggling in 
more than 300 pieces of handguns a few months before the December 
coup attempt. However, it is a credit to a concerned media and public and 



CHAPTER m 93 



the leadership and membership of the House that the convicted member 
eventually resigned. 

C.11. Civil Order 

The upshot of a weak power center in a polity is the propensity of the 
larger civil society to be restive and disaffected. Alienated groups are 
politicized. This perpetuates a vicious cycle, because central authorities 
begin to crack down on civil dissent and a hardening of lines becomes 
more acute. 

Public school teachers, the religious sector, and even those in the 
creative arts, conventionally apolitical, have increasingly taken to the 
streets. Political awakening is infectious, and it is not surprising that 
military elements get politicalized as well. 

A politically charged atmosphere also invites crime and other types 
of anti-social behavior. This especially becomes pronounced in times of 
economic hardship. Manila has one of the highest crime rates interna- 
tionally. In a report of Defense Secretary Fidel V.Ramos, 179,661 crime 
incidents were registered nationwide in 1987, or 26 incidents per 
100,000 people. 13 But what has created the image of civil disorder in the 
minds of the people, perhaps beyond what is warranted by the objective 
situation, is a number of sensational cases that have been particularly 
mishandled by government and which media have seized upon. Among 
these are hostage crises such as the Rizal Alih drama that led to the 
deaths of BGen Eduardo Batalla and Col Romeo Abendan and the 
assassinations of Congressman Moises Espinosa and American Col 
James Rowe. The President and Department of National Defense 
strongly condemned the Digos and Asturias massacres, but like other 
incidents in the past, these two major crimes are likely to remain 
unsolved. 

Contributing to the general state of civil disorder were the strikes, 
work stoppages, demonstrations, and other forms of protest actions by 
all kinds of organizations representing teachers, students, workers, 
farmers, fisherfolk, women, jeepney drivers, and other constituencies. 
The problems fed into each other; people were confronted not only by 
transportation, garbage, and traffic problems, but also power outages 
and water shortages. This confluence of events provided the setting for 
the launching of the December coup attempt which nearly put the 
country over the edge. A final straw was the increase in oil prices a few 
days before the attempted coup. The KilusangMayo Uno (KMU) and the 



94 



Bagong AlyansangMakabayan (BAYAN) were poised to go on a Welgang 
Bay an. 

C.12. Fragility of Democracy 

There is a greater consciousness among Filipinos of the reversibility 
of political arrangements. Change applies not only to administrations, 
but to systems as well. The coup attempts, the insurgency, and the 
secessionist movements are persistent reminders that if real reforms are 
not obtained under a democratic dispensation, radical alternatives may 
become acceptable, feasible, and even affordable. 

It is far easier to dismantle a dictatorial regime than to make a demo- 
cracy work. The forces and resources for achieving the former maybe 
the least appropriate in achieving the latter. People power was easier to 
galvanize against a hated dictator than to build consensus on pressing 
and crucial issues such as foreign debt, retention of the US military 
facilities, agrarian and urban land reform, decentralization, and 
population control. 

Democracy requires an atmosphere of experimentation, pluralism, 
tolerance, empathy. Such an atmosphere is instantaneously denied by 
the resort to terrorism and violence that accompany coup attempts. The 
survivalist response of government to the coups detracts from its 
developmental functions, as well as impairs its ability to guarantee a 
democratic space under which democratic institutions can take root and 
gain strength. 

The choice of democracy is at once a choice, at least in the short term, 
of "inefficiency" in discerning and pursuing the collective purpose. 
Premium is given to the participatory process as an end in itself, 
detracting resources and attention from the objectives of poverty- 
alleviation, social equity, delivery of basic services, and sustainable 
economic growth. 

The change of government from Marcos to President Aquino 
demonstrated the desire of the people to make Philippine democracy 
more participative. This much is enshrined in the 1987 Constitution. 
However, the government has not been as supportive of grassroots 
organizations as it promised, and no law has been enacted which would 
effectively allow people's organizations to participate at "all levels of 
social, political and economic decision making" as envisioned in Article 
XIII, Sections 15 and 16 of the Constitution. If the govern-ment were 
more responsive and such a law passed, the people's stake in the working 



of democracy would increase and grassroots organization would provide 
an effective force against undemocratic attempts to gain political power. 

C.13. Popular Support for Government 

A review of the social history of protest movements in this country 
reveals an increasing emphasis on the notion of "rights" and a corres- 
ponding ability to mobilize action in pursuit of those rights. It is no 
longer just a matter of asking for higher wages or more amenities from 
the government. People's groups have become more militant in asserting 
their rights, and in the process, questioning, confronting, or even seeking 
the overthrow of duly constituted authority. 

While there has been an increasing political sophistication among 
various citizens and groups on the issue of people's rights and entitle- 
ments, there has not been a corresponding increase in their ability to 
assume more responsibilities and obligations. As University of the 
Philippines (UP) President Jose Abueva puts it, we have a societal 
imbalance that may be traceable to the "expansive and romantic" 
rhetoric of the Constitution and the fact that "our constitutional rights 
are not balanced by a bill of duties and obligations." 14 

While the people themselves are not blameless for the general ills of 
our society, a more transcendant leadership in the various sectors of 
government, particularly the Executive, is crucial, when the age-old 
problems of social unrest, political alienation, economic inequities, lack 
of progress especially in relation to our Asian neighbors, and graft and 
corruption are complicated by an unusually heavy debt problem and the 
dynamics of a society in transition from a dictatorship. 

The political environment for the December 1989 and earlier coup 
attempts saw the increased restiveness of various sectors of the population 
in response to issues and problems. This may have led the coup plotters 
to believe that the environment was conducive for such an attempt, 
thinking that the people would rally behind them. 

The people did not. No matter how dissatisfied and frustrated the 
people have become under the current political situation, a military 
takeover has not been considered a preferred alternative by a signi- 
ficant number of people. In the August 1987 coup, civilians were shot, 
wounded, or killed by coup participants because they were jeering the 
soldiers. The people denounced the violence that was perpetuated by the 
coup forces, especially in August 1987 and in December 1989. Clearly, 
while many sectors are restive and are demanding governmental action 



96 



on political, economic, and social reforms in response to the complex 
crisis that appears to grip the nation, it was a mistake for the plotters of 
the December 1989 coup attempt to read this political climate as being 
conducive to a military takeover of government. 

D. Foreign Military Influence 16 

This section looks into foreign military organizations particularly 
in Southeast Asia for plausible influences on the Philippine military 
and the predisposition of some of its elements to launch coups. These 
influences will be categorized into (1) shared regional security pers- 
pectives, (2) demonstration effects of the neighbors' military establish- 
ments on the AFP, (3) relative deprivation of the Philippine military 
compared to its foreign counterparts, and (4) doctrinal and logistical 
influence of a patron military organisation. 

The shift in Philippine foreign policy that occurred in the late 1960s 
and 1970s brought the Philippines closer to the region where it belongs, 
Regional cooperation entailed closer interaction among the military 
establishments of countries in the region. Interaction occurred in joint 
short-term training programs, familiarization tours, participation in 
joint sea and air exercises, conferences, and symposia in the ASEAN, as 
well as in the broader Asia-Pacific region. These regularly and con- 
tinuously exposed Filipino military officers to the role of the military 
in other ASEAN countries, and the nature, benefits, and quality of 
military careers in neighboring countries. 

D.l. Shared Southeast Asian Security Perspectives 

Internal security problems in Southeast Asia stem primarily from 
the contested legitimacy of governments, manifested in insurgency, 
secessionism, cultural strife, and incessant intra-elite struggles. In 
addition to subversion, the inherent weakness of societies in meeting the 
domestic security and welfare requirements of their populations has also 
encouraged continued foreign involvement in internal affairs. To cope 
with internal and external security requirements, stateshave increasingly 
relied on their instruments of legitimate coercion and violence — the 
military establishment— to help resolve critical issues of state viability 
and political independence. 

Political institutions and military establishments at present have 
been fashioned in part by the constant and critical interplay between 
internal and external security requirements in the ASEAN countries of 
Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines. These 



chapter ni 97 



countries in a sense constitute a security community, because none of 
them considers any other ASEAN member a likely aggressor. 16 Since 
1975, they have increased military cooperation among themselves 
especially in the exchange of intelligence, regularized meetings of 
military staffs, and combined training exercises. As a result of these 
interactions, there is an awareness that the military establishments in 
Southeast Asia share common security problems, and that for a number 
of them, a more active military role has proved effective in bringing about 
not only security, but welfare as well. 

D*2. Demonstration Effect 

The eight coups so far attempted in the Philippines are not uncommon 
by Third World standards. Of 157 coup attempts and successful golpes 
de estado which occurred during the 1958 - 1977 period, only six took 
place in Europe, while a vast majority of the coups took place in 55 
countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. By 1985, the military 
controlled governments in 58 of 109 countries in the Third World. 17 

The military-dominated governments in Indonesia and Thailand 
serve as working models of a developmental role for the military. The 
Philippine military could not be oblivious to the fact that in Indonesia 
and Thailand (as well as elsewhere in East Asia — Taiwan and South 
Korea), the military has been active and effective not only in combatting 
communistaggression, quelling multi-ethnic disturbances, and warding 
off external threats, but in pursuing national development goals as well. 
The better benefits and higher level of psychological satisfaction enjoyed 
by military officers and men in these countries reflect their success in 
performing a combined defense and welfare role. 

D.2.a. Indonesian Model 

The armed forces has proven to be an influential instrument in 
Indonesia's struggle for national independence, political stability, 
economic development, and legitimization of an authoritarian rule. 
When civilian supremacy no longer proved to be an effective principle in 
the conduct of government, Indonesia opted for the political dominance 
of its military, which has been steeped and disciplined in the traditional 
values of Pancha Sila and the Soldiers' Oath. The Indonesian military 
nasbeen effective in armed conflict such as the abortive 1965 communist 
prising, the East Timor controversy, and external ones such as the 1963 
Konfrontasi with Malaysia. 



98 



The economic development of Indonesia owes a great deal to the 
active developmental role played by the armed forces under the 
uninterrupted leadership of President Suharto, the general who brought 
the military to power in 1965. Working with a team of professional 
economists, the military gradually re-allocated government resources 
from defense to socio-economic development, successfully striking a 
path toward social welfare and national prosperity. 

The Indonesian Army has also effectively fashioned itself as an 
effective arbiter of national issues and problems through the institu- 
tionalization of the principles of Pancha Sila and Dua Fungsi. Pancha 
Sila refers to five principles: belief in one God, humanitarianism, 
national unity, consultative democracy, and social justice. By guiding 
the proper conduct of society, Pancha Sila is considered above politics. 
The Doktrin Dua Fungsi is the performance by the armed forces of an 
active social and political role in addition to the military or defense role. 
The former entails efforts to develop a prosperous and joint social 
development. 

The most potent doctrine that galvanized the Indonesian military 
since its postwar independence struggle has been its nationalism and its 
anti-communism. The Indonesian Army has enjoyed immense prestige 
because it was successful in the struggle for independence from the 
Dutch and the Japanese, unlike its immediate neighbors, including the 
Philippines, whose independence was rewon by civilian leaders. 

Indonesia's anti-communism is evident in President Suharto's 
warning to President Aquino duringher state visit to Indonesia in 1986: 
"If you give [the CPP/NPA] any opportunity to consolidate, form forces, 
they will use it." 18 To signal their unflagging anti-communism, the 
Indonesian Army executed nine members of the outlawed Indonesian 
Communist Party (PKI) in October 1986, some 19 years after their 
sentencing. 

The model that Indonesia presents to coup plotters is not only the 
developmental role of the military, but also the radical solution to the 
communist threat. The so-called "Indonesian solution" to the communist 
problem refers to the physical elimination by the Indonesian Army 
of more than half a million suspected communists during the period 
1965 - 1969. 19 The Indonesian solution is said to have inspired the anti- 
communist purge led by the Chilean military in 1973. 20 The Indonesian 
solution appears to appeal to the RAM-Honasan Faction (RAM-HF) and 
the Young Officers Union (YOU), who consider a "surgical operation" 
justified to achieve their purpose. 



CHAPTER III 99 



D.2.b. Thai Model 

The Thai and the Indonesian military are complementary and 
mutually reinforcing models for the Philippine military. 

A notable feature in the rule of the military in Thailand is reflected 
in the interlocking relationships between it and the business sector. 
Through the numerous business and economic connections of the military, 
much of the economic growth and development of Thailand was spurred. 
However, this kind of politico-economic relations in at least one instance, 
disturbed the generally close relationship between the military and the 
monarchy which is the' key factor to Thai stability. 21 

Another feature of the Thai military that may have inspired similar 
developments in the Philippine military is the formation of the Young 
Military Officers Group (Young Turks) of the Royal Thai Armed Forces 
(RTAF). The Group questioned the posture and beliefs and distanced 
themselves from their elder officers and superiors. 22 The populist and 
democratic sentiments of the Young Turks resulted in the successful 
overthrow of the civilian government in 1977. After losing power, they 
tried again in 1981 but they were unsuccessful because of the timely 
intervention of the royal family. Nevertheless, the young military 
officers have laid claim to being arbiters of conflict and to being an 
activist force for social change. 

The Thai Young Turks may have inspired a group of junior Filipino 
military officers who participated in the failed December coup to step out 
of the shadow of RAM-HF to mount their own opposition to the Aquino 
government. They call themselves the YOU. According to an AFP 
document, YOU's earliest manifestations were the statements and press- 
releases issued in 1986 by the so-called Young Lieutenants, Captains 
and Majors (YLCM) which during that time expressed plans of forming 
apolitical party within the military as a counter-force to the CPP/NPA. 
The document identified the YOU's membership as revolving around 
PMAbatches 1978 to 1988 and reservists who are mostly assigned in the 
National Capital Region. 23 

Unlike the RAM-HF, there seems to be no personality cult in YOU 
and no traditional political sponsors to compromise thegroup's principles. 
According to observers, there was considerable unhappiness within 
the ranks of military rebels over the macho-like image woven around 
nonasan This may explain why the YOU chose to release its state- 
ments through a collective fictional spokesman — Capt Carlos 
Maglalang. 24 



100 



The YOU believes that "the military institution is not limited to 
being a mere security force but is an active partner in nation-building." 
It contends that instead of depoliticizing the military, it should be 
ideologized into a pro-people army and a law enforcement institution. 26 

Just like the Thai Young Turks of the 1980s, the YOlTs initial 
grievances focused on its own military hierarchy. The main issues raised 
were those of low pay, a distorted promotions system, and graft and 
corruption in the higher echelons. The YOU sought to differentiate itself 
from the RAM-HF and the Soldiers of the Filipino People (SFP) through 
their ideology of Filipinism, which it defines as the non-communist Left 
alternative to imperialism, fascism, and communism. Similar to the 
Thai Young Turks, the YOU has also employed leftist rhetorics, e.g., 
mass democracy, anti-capitalism, anti-elitism. 

D.2.C. Limited Applicability of the Models 

While the Indonesian and Thai models may have persuasive 
influences on the Filipino military interventionists, various prerequisites 
for the apparent success of these models are not found in the Philippines. 

The degree of socio-economic development in Indonesia at the time 
of independence was so low that the Indonesian Army was thfi modern 
sector in Indonesia. The communist uprising in 1965 which induced the 
prominence of the military in society has no parallel in the Philippines. 
The so-called Indonesian solution where more than half a million were 
executed based on mere suspicion would be unacceptable to Filipinos. 

Other conditions in Indonesia do not apply to the Philippines. For 
one, oil resources have allowed the military to play a developmental role, 
earmarkingresourcesfornationaldevelopment, despite the inefficiencies 
of widespread graft and corruption. Indonesia is also one of the world's 
largest nations, and like China and the Soviet Union, authoritarian rule 
and an increased political role for the military have found greater 
legitimacy and justification. Furthermore, the Indonesian military is 
also inextricably linked tointense Indonesian nationalism thatdeveloped 
out of the struggle for independence. 

On the other hand, the Thais have a stable and powerful political 
institution in the monarchy, which has served as a moderating, checking, 
and legitimizing influence on military rule. As the ASEAN frontline 
state it has been deeply involved and concerned with the conflict in Laos, 
Cambodia, and Vietnam. Actual penetration of the Thai border has led 
to the military's engagement of external forces. These are conditions 



CHAPTER HI 101 



that have necessitated and justified a high-profile political role for the 
Thai armed forces, conditions which are not present in the Philippine 
case. The fact that the Thais have no colonial experience may also 
explain the self-confidence of the Thai military which may not be present 
in equal measure to the Philippines. 

In both the Indonesian and Thai cases, there are also religious and 
cultural variables that must be considered. The Buddhist religion in 
Thailand and Islam in Indonesia give these countries a different cultural 
perspective from the Philippines, which is predominantly Roman Catholic. 
In fact, studies suggest the Philippines is closer to Latin America in 
terms of psycho-cultural make-up, rather than to Asia. 

On the whole, the military forces of Indonesia and Thailand are able 
to work within the framework of philosophical ideas, historical factors, 
and national objectives that had long taken root in their respective 
indigenous societies. 26 

D,3. Relative Deprivation 

The constant interaction of Filipino military officers with their 
counterparts from other ASEAN countries conceivably makes the former 
feel underprivileged, less modern, and less prestigious by comparison, in 
terms of the overall quality of the armed forces, and the benefits and 
privileges of individual military officers. For example, the Malaysian 
government purchased some US$2 billion worth of new military 
equipment over the last two years for its army. Indonesia and Singapore 
have outfitted their air force with F-16 A/B aircrafts. 27 By comparison, 
the AFP suffers as most of its equipment are either surplus or used. 

The quality and capability of the AFP can also be gleaned from the 
levels of military expenditure^ The Philippine military spends the least 
amount, as a percentage of GNP, among the ASEAN countries even 
though as a percentage of central government appropriations^ ranks 
third. Within ASEAN, the Philippines receives less US Foreign Military 
Sales (FMS) credits than Thailand, which does not host a US base. 

The uniformed services in Malaysia are well-paid, well-cared for 
upon retirement, and enjoy commercial opportunities when no longer in 
active duty. There are no glaring grievances to justify exceeding their 
traditional role. Also, the police balance off the army with their 
paramilitary activities, manpower, equipment, and control of the 
intelligence apparatus of the country. 



102 



In addition to the formal rewards and benefits provided by the 
military establishment, Thai military officers have also enjoyed for 
decades lucrative business affiliations and operations. 28 Commercial 
benefits are likewise enjoyed by Malaysian and Indonesian officers upon 
retirement. 

Not even the martial law years provided a comparable situation for 
the Philippine military, because of the inequity in the distribution of 
benefits. Though these years gave the military the biggest share in the 
national budget (about 24 percent of government expenditures in 1974), 
equity and distribution among the military men were not fulfilled. 29 

While the average Filipino soldier remained in a dismal economic 
state, the favored military officers enjoyed relative comfort due to 
additional income from government-owned and -controlled enterprises. 
The drastic reduction in such business-related benefits under the present 
administration may have led to heightened feelings of relative deprivation 
among many military officers. 

D.4. Doctrinal and Logistical Influence 

The persistent influence of American security perspectives and 
military doctrines primarily stems from the inertia of Philippine- 
American "special relations", which has continued to be manifested in 
the participation of Filipino officers in American military training 
programs and the continuing logistical dependence of the Philippines on 
the United States. 

These "special relations" most obvious on the area of military 
relations have for decades predisposed the Philippine military to adopt 
or be sympathetic to the "security" and "threat" perceptions of the US. 
In the Cold War era, the Philippine armed forces supported the military 
campaign of the US against communism in Korea and Vietnam. Presently, 
the anti-communist struggle in Philippine territory is said to conform to 
the "low-intensity conflict" strategy favored by the Pentagon. The defeat 
or containment of communist insurgencies remains one of the pillars of 
American security policy in Southeast Asia. 

The United States tops the other countries in terms of the extent 
of the training programs it offers Philippine military personnel. Its 
security assistance to the Philippines under the International Military 
Education Training Program (IMETP) started in 1950. By 1985 about 
$41,529 million had been expended for training of 18,071 Philippine 
military officers. 30 The influence of the program may perhaps be 



CHAPTER HI 103 



discerned in the training policies of the AFP meant to continue and be 
directed towards developing highly- trained personnel in small unit 
operations. The rationale and content of the curriculum reveal an 
unmistakably US pattern and orientation. 

AFP defense capabilities are primarily geared for maintaining 
internal order, rather than meeting external security needs. This 
development is a function of the security arrangements between the 
Philippines and the United States (Military Bases Agreement, Military 
Assistance Pact, and the Mutual Defense Treaty) since 1947. As already 
noted in Chapter II, the Philippines has been dependent on the US for 
its external security, and for its internal security weaponry. This twin 
dependency provides the US continuing leverage to retain its military 
facilities in the Philippine bases. 

Philippine dependence on a single source of arms (i.e., the United 
States) seems to have increased as evidenced by the fact that it obtained 
82 percent of its weapons from the US for the 1981 - 1985 period, 
compared to 76 percent during the 1961 - 1965 period. Moreover, with- 
out prior American consent, the Philippines cannot purchase weapons 
from third countries. Thus, Philippine-American security arrangements, 
coupled with low Philippine economic capabilities, have led to the AFP 
being the least modern armed forces in ASEAN. 

E. Political Orientations in the Philippine Military 31 

This section presents the psychomilieu of selected officers, men, and 
units of the military. Central to the soldier's psychomilieu are his 
political orientations — values, beliefs, attitudes, expectations about 
government and politics. These may or may not correspond to the 
objective milieu. 

To examine the present political orientations in the AFP, a number 
of private research organizations and individual social scientists were 
invited by the Commission to present proposals. The Commission 
evaluated several proposed methods for studying the political orienta- 
tions of officers and men in the military establishment. Basically, two 
methods were considered: a random survey of the military, and interviews 
with purposively selected respondents from military units of particular 
interest to the Commission. The Commission decided to undertake the 
wer approach instead of a full random sample survey of the entire 
unitary establishment. It was neither feasible nor prudent for the 
commission to attempt an AFP-wide sample survey because (1) it could 
°e anticipated and manipulated by renegade elements to reflect a biased 



104 



political orientation, which could then be used to create a bandwagon 
effect in swinging military and civilian support for the coup plotters; (2) 
it would involve obtrusive measures, plausibly politicalizinga significant 
cross-section of the military by exposing them to novel, politically 
sensitive questions and possibly inducing an "opinion" where there may 
have been none; (3) a random sample would require interviews of specific 
officers and men who may be deployed in combat zones, entailing 
extremely high costs, or an unacceptably large number of substitutions; 
and (4) such a study would take too long to conduct, process, and analyze. 

In adopting the key respondents approach, the Commission settled 
for an indicative reading of the state of mind of selected strategic military 
units — most of which were directly involved as coup forces in the 
December 1989 coup attempt (with some anti-coup forces included for 
comparative purposes). The results of the study would be useful in 
suggesting how far reforms and changes undertaken by the government 
and the military leadership since the last coup may have rendered 
participation in another coup less likely for officers and men of the 
selected strategic units. 

Since the units which supported the previous coup were already 
"neutralized" (i.e., confinement, re-assignment or dismissal) of rebel 
elements in the aftermath of the failed December 1989 coup, the 
questions that had to be answered were: As thev presently stand, what 
are the political orientations of th e officers and men in these selected 
military units? How conducive are these oriftntntin ns to unauthorized 
military actions? Based on their pnliH^I onentntinn s, what is the 
likelihood that the selected units wonlH j 9 j p yet another coup? 

The selected military units consisted of company- or battalion-sized 
formations identified by the Commission as having played a role in the 
December 1989 coup attempt. Afew of the units studied were not exactly 
the same units which participated in the said coup attempt because the 
latter had been disbanded and their leaders and men detained. Hence, 
a few of the study units consisted of reconstituted military units to which 
participants in the failed December 1989 coup had been re-assigned. 

The study plan called for interviews with key respondents from 12 
units pre-identified by the Commission to be conducted in June and July 
1990. For each unit, the pre-selected key respondents were the unit's 
Executive Officer (EX-O), one platoon leader, and the company sergeant. 
Two "opinion leaders" in the unit identified by these pre-selected key 
respondents were added to the list. At five respondents for each of the 
12 units, a total of 60 interviews were to be conducted 



CHAPTER HI 105 



An interview guide was designed to enable eight field researchers to 
cover uniformly and comprehensively the aspects of political orientation 
the study was concerned with. The respondents were asked to describe 
not their personal attitudes, but the attitudes of the members of the unit 
with regard to the various political subjects broached in the interview. 
It was part of the intention of the study, however, that in describing the 
attitudes of the other members of the unit, the informant would actually 
be "projecting* faithfully his own attitudes. Such projections, from the 
study's point of view, were acceptable as representations of the orientation 
of the whole unit, especially where the information and data from the five 
respondents in the unit cross-validated one another. 

The results of the study using this method were meant to be 
indicative rather than conclusive. The results are applicable 
only to the selected units taken as a group and should not be 
extrapolated to the entire AFP. The key respondents were not 
randomly selected from the members of the units, so the information is 
not, strictly speaking, generalizable for the unit. However, validity in 
this case may not be any less than in a random survey where soldiers are 
asked about their own opinion, but mask their true predispositions. 

The Commission was able to access the tentative results of a survey 
conducted by the AFP involving 1,519 respondents in November and 
December 1989 (just before and immediately after the coup attempt). 
The results of the two surveys seem to validate each other. 

The respondents in the June-July 1990 study were asked to describe 
he political orientations of the officers and men in their respective units 
towards the following: 

1. political issues and problems, personalities and institutions 

2. the nature of Philippine government and politics 

3. preferred mode of political change in the Philippines (status quo, 
reform, or radical change) 

4. the role of the military in Philippine government and politics, 
and 

5. unauthorized military actions 
E.l. Political Orientation 

E.l.a. Military Issues and Problems 



Within the military, issues relating to their material well-being and 
their families are foremost in the minds of officers and Non- 



106 

Commissioned Officers (NCOs). The main concerns of soldiers in the 
selected units are their low salaries, allowances, and benefits; the 
inadequate, inferior, and delayed distribution of equipment; and 
disparities in pay, promotions, and disciplinary actions. Issues of a 
non-material nature were the ineffective AFP leadership, the public 
outcry against the politicization of the military, graft and corruption 
within the military establishment, and unfair treatment of rebel soldiers 
compared to communist rebels. 

E.l.b. National Issues and Problems 

From a national perspective, issues relating to the quality of political 
leadership and the government are the greatest concern of officers and 
NCOs. The main ones are graft and corruption in government, weak and 
ineffective national leadership, poor economic conditions of the people, 
"too much politics" in government, the continuing growth of insurgency, 
and the slow justice system. 

Officers show much more concern about graft and corruption than 
NCOs, while NCOs show much more concern about the socio-economic 
conditions of the people. The officers appear to be more politically- 
oriented than the NCOs. 

E.l.c. Preferred Resource Person 
on the National Situation 

Soldiers in the selected military units prefer national leaders and 
high-ranking military officers to be their resource persons on the 
national situation. Among the favorites were ex-Secretary of Agrarian 
Reform Miriam Santiago, President Aquino, Secretary Ramos, Gen 
Renato de Villa, MGen Rodolfo Biazon, and Senators Jovito Salonga, 
Ernesto Maceda, Rene Saguisag, and Aquilino Pimentel. 

E.1.(L Assessment of Overall Operation of Government 

Seven out of ten of all respondents say their units are dissatisfied 
with the overall operation of government. The main reasons given were 
(1) government is incompetent and ineffective, (2) government has not 
been able to provide for the soldiers 7 basic needs, (3) there are too many 
politicians and corrupt government personnel, and (4) government is 
unable to deliver basic services to the people. 

Eight out often officer respondents are dissatisfied with the overall 
operation of government compared to six out often NCOs. 



CHAPTER HI 107 



E.l.e. Perceptions of Threats to Government 

The two greatest threats to the stability of government are the 
communist rebels and politicians and corrupt officials. A majority of 
officers think the communist rebels are a more serious threat than 
politicians and corrupt officials; a majority of NCOs believe politicians 
and corrupt officials are a more serious threat compared to the communist 
rebels. 

E.li. Attitude Towards Political Change 

Nine out of ten respondents think their units prefer reforms as 
against radical change or maintenance of the status quo as a solution to 
the problems of the country. More officers are radical-minded than 
NCOs; more NCOs are conservative than officers. Interestingly, the 
respondents almost to a man understood "radical change" to mean a 
military takeover of government. 

E.l.g. Attitude Towards Military Participation in Politics 

There is a wide range of opinion among the respondents as to 
whether the military should have a bigger share in government decision- 
making or not. These range from (1) the military not sharing in 
government decision-making, (2) the military participating but only in 
areas where "it has expertise", to (3) the military participating because 
"it has a role to play." 

More officers believe the military should not participate in government 
decision-making, while more NCOs think the military should participate 
as "it has a role to play" in politics. 

E.l.h. Issue and Problem Areas Salient to the Military 

The respondents think that if the military should participate, in 
decision-making, it should be in the areas of counter-insurgency, the 
organization of the military, US military bases issue, treatment of coup 
participants, human rights policy, government's socio-economic program, 
and morality and ethical concerns in government, in that order. 

E.l.i. Qualities Conducive to Military's 
Political Participation 

If the military were to help solve the problems of the nation, the 
respondents believe that the military's discipline is its most important 



108 | 

contribution. They also mentioned sense of service, duty, and self- 
sacrince;themilitary , snrst-h^^ 

and field experiences that render the military better informed of people's 
problems than local civilian officials. 

E.l j. Foremost Concerns in Unauthorized Military Action 

The respondents agreed that soldiers have no way of knowing in 
advance whether their unit is about to undertake an unauthorized 
military action. Family is the foremost concern of a soldier involved in 
an unauthorized military action. Unit "esprit de corps" is a bigger 
concern for officers compared to NCOs, while "career" is a bigger concern 
for NCOs compared to officers, 

E.2. Classification of Coup Participants 

Based on the description of the respondents, the participants in 
coups and similar unauthorized military actions may be classified into 
six categories of awareness and involvement — the deceived, the 
conformist , the gambler , the agnostic, the believer, and the plotter - 

E.2.a. The Deceived 

He joins because he thinks he is on some secret mission, or is told it 
is for some exercise. When fighting starts and he realizes what is 
happening, he becomes a conformist, as esprit de corps gets the better of 
him. 

E.2.b. The Conformist 

He joins the coup because everybody else in his unit does. He figures 
if he would not be a target of the constitutionalist forces, he would be the 
target of the rebel forces. As one informant says, "Magsisisi na langkung 
tapos na, Nandiyan na yan. Napasubo na. n (The time to regret is when 
its all over. It's already there. We're already in it.) 

E.2.C. The Gambler 

In the event of a coup, he. would initially be on the government side, 
but ultimately, for whichever is the winning side, because he has to think 
of his career and his family. He regards brigade- or division -level 
"unauthorized moves" as acceptable as their probability of success is 
higher compared to company or battalion moves. 



CHAKl'EK 111 



llttf 



EJZ.&. The Agnostic 

He is generally against a coup d'etat or any illegitimate measure to 
subvert the government. But, in extreme cases, when the government 
persists to be unresponsive, he will find a coup justifiable. 

E.2.e. The Believer 

He joins a coup because he believes absolutely in his superior officer. 
He does not mind risking his personal safety; he does this everyday. He 
is more likely to be a younger than an older officer. 

The Plotter 

He is convinced that the military holds the solution to the ills of the 
nation and military intervention is the avenue to personal political 
power. He justifies his actions through some ingenious interpretation 
ofhis "constitutional duty", e.g., to save the President from the politicians 
who surround and control her or to save the country. 

E.3. Predisposition of Selected Units for Political Action 

On the whole, seven out of the 12 selected units appear predisposed 
to participate in future unauthorized military actions against the govern- 
ment (Interventionists), v/hile five units appear predisposed to defend 
the government and uphold the Constitution (Constitutionalists). A 
brief political orientation profile of each unit is presented below to 
provide a sense of this rather serious conclusion. For the moment, the 
real identity of the units are not disclosed. 

E.3.a. Results By Units 

Command^ Based on interviews with selected respondents from 
the unit, Command A shows constitutionalist inclinations. The present 
Commanding Officer (CO) happens to be the single officer who resisted 
the orders of the previous CO to join the December 1989 coup attempt. 
A firm believer in the Constitution, he is widely respected. The 
respondents are one in saying that the appointment of the CO and the 
reforms he has instituted are the best and most memorable events in the 
Command. 

Similarly, Command B displays constitutionalist inclinations. 
Although, the respondents are politicalized and dissatisfied with 
government, most expressed an aversion to coups as these foster 



110 



factionalism in the military, apart from their having proved futile in 
previous attempts. . 

On balance, Command C shows constitutionalist inclinations. The 
respondents from the Command are not politicized and their concern is 
largely the economic welfare of soldiers and their families. They believe 
the military should be consulted in government decision-making, but 
that decisions must all be left to officials in government. 

Air Force Attack Snuadron , There is reason to believe that elements 
of Attack Squadron D of Strike Wing E of the PAF have interventionist 
inclinations. The enmity between the Flying School and PMA graduates 
may again prompt them to take opposite sides in the event of another 
coup. Both officer and NCO respondents in the unit are also politicalized; 
they consider graft and corruption the root cause of government problems 
and the major threat to its stability. 

Philippine Marines. The members of Company E of Marine 
Battalion LandingTeam (MBLT) F indicate constitutionalist inclinations. 
This company was only provisionally organized as a counter-coup force 
and cannot have any participation in a coup unless reconstituted. 
Nonetheless, its former members are generally committed to democracy, 
are believers in civilian supremacy over the military, and are strongly 
anti-coup. 

Likewise, Marine Company G shows constitutionalist inclinations. 
The CO and other officers of the unit hold constitutionalist views and are 
well-liked by their men. These officers express strong disdain for rebel 
soldiers. They are most concerned and emotional about the damage the 
December 1989 coup attempt has wrought on the image of the Marines. 

Infantry Ma in Luzon, Company H of the Infantry Battalion I 
operating in Central Luzon would likely be interventionist in the event 
of another coup. The CO of the unit, who allegedly joined the December 
1989 coup attempt, is unrepentant about his involvement in that coup. 
He remains dissatisfied with government and believes in radical change 
if no reforms are forthcoming from government

CHAPTER HI HI 



Another likely interventionist is Company L of Infantry Battalion 
M, also operating in Central Luzon. Prior to its reorganization as 
Infantry Battalion M, the company's mother unit was Infantry Battalion 
N which sided with the RAM-HF during the August 1987 coup attempt. 
As Infantry Battalion M, they participated in the December 1989 coup 
attempt on the orders of a well-known renegade lieutenant colonel, their 
battalion commander at the time. 

Infanto Units in Mindanao. Company P of Infantry Battalion Q, 
operating in Mindanao would be predisposed to join another coup. In 
fact, the CO of the unit said he would follow an order to join a coup if this 
were to come from higher levels such as the brigade or division. 

Similarly, Company R of Infantry Battalion S, also operating in 
Mindanao is inclined to be interventionist. The CO and EX-0 are 
disgruntled with the present government because of its weak and 
inefficient leadership. This unit is additionally susceptible because its 
battalion commander is a brother of a renegade officer and the current 
CO was reportedly a participant in the failed December 1989 coup. 

The third Mindanao study unit, Company T belonging to Light 
Armor Battalion U operating in Mindanao, is also inclined to intervene. 
The unit's CO complains about the "politicking* in government, and 
graftandcorruptionbothin the military and in the civilian government. 
The CO is well-liked by.his men and could sway them to his side. 

E.3.b. Other Findings 

In many ways, the distinction between the Interventionists and the 
Constitutionalists does not lie in whether units are or are not politicalized. 
With the exception of Command C, all of the study units are rather 
politicalized in that they (1) view politicians with disdain; (2) complain 
about graft and corruption in government; (3) perceive President Aquino 
as a weak President; (4) are dissatisfied with the present government 
because it is unable to deliver basic services to the people; and (5) favor 



?er decision-making role for the military in areas pertinent to it 
such as counter-insurgency, US bases, human rights, military orga- 
nization, and trial of rebel soldiers. ^ " 

What distinguishes the two is the nature and extent of the units' 
Participation in previous coups, particularly the December 1989 attempt. 

unit s participation in earlier coups has tended to heighten its 
jyovernment sentiments along the areas mentioned above, 

aamg the unit to be more convinced of the righteousness of 



112 



coups. If the Interventionist units were to find themselves in another 
coup, they may move with more determination. 

EA. Leadership, Socialization, and Milieu Factors 

Apart from the levels of politicalization and dissatisfaction within 
the military, the data in the study indicate the following factors help to 
motivate soldiers to join a coup. However, it should be noted that the 
very same factors can motivate a soldier to resist a coup. These factors 
are: 

E.4.a« Fraternal Ties and Family Relationships 

Family ties appear to be extensive, given the tendency of military 
men to encourage their sons and other relations to pursue a career in 
soldiering. Similarly, fraternal "batchmate" and "schoolmate" ties 
endure and have been mobilized to subvert the chain of command 
through a coup attempt. 

E.4.b. In-groups and Out-groups in Military Training ; 

The "in-group, out-group" distinction that is fostered to mold militiy 
units into effective combat units also creates the inter-service rivalries 
(e.g., Army vs PC) and intra-unit factionalization (Marines vs other 
Navy units, Flying School vs PMA graduates in the same Air Force 
squadron), that render military units susceptible to manipulation and 
often places them on opposite sides in a coup attempt. 



CHAPTER III 



113 



E.4.c. The Role of COs and Other Ranking Officers 



-■ A si 



In addition to the hierarchical and authoritarian structure dft|||| 
military, soldiers tend to idolize their commanding officers, vA 
enable disgruntled officers to persuade entire units to side with l;L- 
government forces. In a case where the commanding officer is dia|Rj 
by his men, soldiers are prone to take the opposite of whatever stancll 
CO takes. ^ 

E.4.(L Other Personal Factors 

The participation of soldiers in unauthorized military action*» 
"wbeinfluenced^ 

to one Iglesia m Kristo soldier, it was the strength of their religious 
convictions that prevailed on them not to join the coup, even as their 
fellow soldiers ostracized them for not doing so 



E.5. Summary of the Study 



The study shows that two units shifted from their previous 
predisposition to join a coup to its present anti-coup attitude. This 
indicates some success in the government's corrective measures. The 
shifts are attributable to the assignment of respected commanding 
officers with a constitutionalist orientation. However, other units, in 
spite of having been neutralized of rebel elements but with the same 
commander, appear to retain a predisposition towards coups. 

As suggested above, participation in previous coup attempts is 
crucial in explaining the predisposition of military men to participate in 
succeeding attempts. 

The next chapter discusses how the previous coup attempts were 
preludes to and preparations for the December 1989 attempt, tracing the 
continuity of the effort to grab power, the involvement ofkey personalities 
and military units, and the interaction of military principals with 
civilian co-conspirators and supporters.

MILITARY INTERVENTION IN THE 
PHILIPPINES: 1986 - 1987 



The most significant development arising from the series of military 
interventions from 1986 to the present is the emergence of the AFP as a' 
potentially decisive political force in our society. There had been seven 
attempts at military intervention from the period of 1986 until just 
before the latest one in December 1989. These are (1) the February 1986 
coup attempt, (2) the July 1986 Manila Hotel incident, (3) the November 
1986 "God Save The Queen" plot, (4) the January 1987 GMA-7 incident, 
(5) the April 1987 "Black Saturday" incident, (6) the July 1987 takeover 
plot of the Manila International Airport (MIA), and (7) the August 1987 
coup attempt. 

All the coup attempts are irretrievably linked and cannot be analyzed 
in isolation of each other. Thus, the December 1989 attempt can only be 
fully understood if viewed in the light of the previous ones. This chapter 
will analyze the 1986 - 1987 attempts, while the succeeding chapter will 
deal with the December 1989 incident On the basis of the testimonies 
and separate accounts of events, the "God Save The Queen" plot was the 
most dangerous threat to the Aquino government, if it h ad been executed 
as planned — a chain-of-command takeover. Fortunately, top military 
officers led by then Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines . 
(CSAFP) Gen Fidel V. Ramos refused to go along with it and effectively 
contained it That very little is publicly known about it, since there was 
no actual fighting, does not detract from this conclusion. 

A. February 1986 Coup Attempt 

Much "as already been written about the bloodless EDSA People 
Power Revolt (EDSA Revolt) that occurred from 22-25 February 1986, 
when Filipinos massed in the streets of Metro Manila, mostly around 
Camps Crame and A^inaldo, to openly defy the authoritarian rule of 
Ferdinand Marcos and to show support for a group led by then Defense 



CHAPTER IV H9 



Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and Vice Chief of Staff Lt Gen Ramos, who 
had declared their withdrawal of support for the Marcos government. 
However, not enough has been written about the original plan to stage 
a coup d'etat by a group of middle-ranking officers referred to as the 
Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM), but which was eventually 
overtaken by the now hi storic People Power Revolt. A review of the event 
from different perspectives raises questions on the motives of the 
principal actors and the historical accuracy of their version of the event. 
The narration of events in this chapter is largely drawn from published 
materials, unless stated otherwise. 

There is no exact date when RAM was founded, but those close to the 
officers identified with it place the year as 1982. 1 It is clear, however, 
that the RAM was controlled by military officers closely linked with then 
Defense Minister, and now Senator Enrile. The emergence of RAM was 
principally a reaction of young officers against such issues as the 
widespread corruption in the military, the lack of professionalism, 
promotions based on favoritism, and "overstaying" generals who blocked 
the younger generation's career advancement. What is less evident is 
that RAM also served Enrile's political agenda and provided him personal 
security, as he perceived increasing threats from Mrs Imelda R. Marcos, 
and Gen Fabian Ver, who was appointed Chief of Staff by President 
Marcos in 1981. Enrile himself revealed at the 1986 press conference 
that announced his break with Marcos that, "As far back as 1982, we 
have been getting persistent reports that there were efforts to eliminate 
us . . . and it was [at] that point that we decided to organize a group to 
protect ourselves . . . now known as the AFP Reform Movement." 2 

According to Cecilio Arillo, a journalist closely identified with Enrile 
and the RAM, matters became untenable for Enrile when defense 
intelligence reports disclosed that barely a few weeks after Ver's 
appointment to General Headquarters (GHQ), a "hit" team was allegedly 
formed in Mindanao to liquidate the defense minister. 3 To counter this, 
Enrile's security group at the Ministry of National Defense (MND), 
mostly PMA graduates led by Lt Coi Gregorio Honasan (PMA 71), 
underwent rigid training in counter-terrorism in Quezon province. 
Some 300 men were trained by two retired British instructors of the elite 
Special Air Service Regiment. Moreover, they were armed with specialized 
weapons, mainly Uzis and Galils, imported from Israel and allegedly 
brought in through connections in the Bureau of Customs, where Enrile 
was once commissioner. 4 



In 1982, to avoid detection, the training of these men was moved from 
-zon to the Sierra Madre mountains in northern Luzon. However, 



120 



this did not escape Ver's attention and it was reported to Marcos, who 
became furious about it, fanning his suspicions about the defense 
minister's political ambitions. When the President confronted him with 
the report, Enrile completely denied it and blamed it on political or 
personal intrigues. 5 By July 1983, Enrile's men had resumed their 
training in Quezon province. 

At this time, while the hostility between Enrile and Ver intensified, 
a parallel conflict on the personal level seemed to have been developing 
between Honasan and Col Irwin Ver, Gen Ver's son who was a year 
ahead of Honasan at the PMA. 6 As a sign of further consolidation of his 
power, Gen Ver acquired operational control of the Integrated National 
Police (INP), a responsibility that normally should have been vested on 
Ramos as then Chief of Philippine Constabulary (PC), but was transferred 
by Marcos to his Chief of Staff on 1 August 1983. By then, too, rumors 
were rife about Marcos' s illness and the problem of his successor. As the 
names of Mrs Marcos and Gen Ver circulated as leading contenders, 
Enrile's own chances seemed to diminish. 

By 21 August 1983, RAM had formed an 11-man Ad Hoc Steering 
Committee to give direction to the organization and analyze current 
events, including the implications of the Aquino assassination. 7 According 
to a member of this Committee, the 11 members are (ranks shown as of 
1985 - 1986): the late Col Eugene Ocampo PC (PMA '58), Capt Rex Robles 
PN (PMA '65), Lt Col Hector Tarrazona PAF (PMA '68), Lt Col Gregorio 
Honasan PA (PMA '7 1), Lt Col Victor Batac PC (PMA '7 1), Maj Alejandro 
Flores PC (PMA '72), Maj Napoleon de los Santos PC (PMA '75), Capt 
Charlemagne Alejandrino PC (PMA '75), Lt Jose Renato Abella PA 
(PMA 79), Lt Gregorio Catapang, Jr PA (PMA '81), and Lt Rafael Tadeo, 
Jr PC (PMA '81). 8 Except for this Committee, RAM does not appear to 
have a roster of members. It was an unstructured organization whose 
meetings were said to be open to any officer or soldier interested in 
reforming the AFP. The objectives articulated by the members were (1) 
to fight graft and corruption in the AFP; (2) to ask for promotions based 
on performance, merit, seniority, and fairness; (3) to work for better 
medical attention and services; (4) to eliminate the bata-bata system; 
and (5) to improve logistical support for the officers and men fighting 
insurgency in the field. 9 However, it appears that while the RAM 
leadership was publicly known through the Steering Committee, there 
was a hidden "inner circle" composed of Honasan, Lt Col Eduardo 
^punan(PMA'71), Col Tirso Gador (PMA '66), possibly Navy Capt 
Fehx Tunngan ("Baron" of PMA '65), and one other officer, who plotted 
the February 1986 coup. 10 



CHAPTER IV 121 



The RAM steadily grew as Honasan contacted former PMA classmates 
and alumni, as well as comrades from his Mindanao days (he had been 
posted there, but was transferred to the MND in 1975 when he was 
wounded in the leg). Subsequently, even senior officers who were retired 
from active service, but were supportive of reforms in the AFP, were 
organized into Senior Cavaliers of RAM (SCRAM) led by, among others, 
Gen Jesus Vargas (PMA '29), former CSAFP, and Navy Capt Antonio 
Tansingco (PMA '55). Retired BGen Jose Almonte (PMA '56), then still 
acolonel, revealed in his testimony before the Fact-Finding Commission 
on 4 January 1990 that discussions among the RAM in 1986 considered 
having a political arm which would be the RAM; and an armed group, 
the Soldiers of the Filipino People (SFP). 

Among Constabulary men, Batac, a classmate close to Honasan, 
became the main RAM organizer in the PC. 11 On 6 February 1985, six 
officers met, mostly from the intelligence think tank of the PC Head- 
quarters. Three days later, another meeting of four officers followed. On 
15 February, 23 PC officers met. The next day, they drafted RAMs 
Declaration of Principles, which was distributed to officers as the 
"Preliminary Statements of Aspirations" during the PMA Alumni 
Association convention on 17 February. 

The RAM appears to have escalated its organizing activities in 1985, 
which could account for the general impression that it was founded in 
that year. On 15 March, the RAM formulated its nine-point "Statement 
of Common Aspiration s," and on 21 March, it came out with a position 
paper entitled "We Belong . . . short for "We Belong to the Reform the 
Armed Forces Movement." All three statements were printed in a 
pamphlet called "Crossroads to Reform.* During the traditional PMA 
Alumni Parade at graduation time on 21 March, some 300 young officers, 
mostly from Classes 1971 to 1984, broke away from the long line at the 
parade ground to display a banner marked "Unity Through Reforms." 
They wore T-shirts that said "We Belong." It was the day before the 
customary Commander-in-Chiefs address to the graduating class, thus 
marking the first public protest of the military during the Marcos 
regime. 12 

On 2 April 1985, the official name of RAM was coined from another 
acronym, "R.E.F.O.R.M. the AFP Movement" during a meeting at the 
MND Social Hall. "R.E.F.O.R.M." cryptically stood for Restore Ethics, 
Fair-Mindedness, Order, Righteousness and Morale. Two weeks later, 
presumably under orders from Malacanang, Ramos, who was then 
acting Chief of Staff while Ver was on leave to face trial in the Aquino- 
Galman case, met with RAM officers for seven hours to find out more 



122 



about the organization. The proceedings of the meeting were taped and 
must have been relayed to Marcos. At the end of May, the President 
called RAM officers to Malacanang for another meeting, which mostly 
consisted of Marcos' s monologue for 40 minutes, berating them. Later, 
Honasan obtained a copy of a supposedly Malacanang-prepared order of 
battle with the names of Honasan, Batac, Tarrazona, 13 Kapunan, and 
some ten other RAM officers on it. 14 The "war" was on. 

Meanwhile, the Enrile forces in Cagayan and at the MND had 
mapped out contingency plans which went beyond securing EnrileV 
personal safety, to preventing Mrs Marcos and Gen Ver from taking over 
in case Marcos died, to directly maneuvering against Marcos. The RAM 
was a perfect political vehicle. Even as it publicly advocated reforms 
in the AFP, its inner circle continued to plan for a coup d'etat By 
September 1985, the plans for a coup were well advanced. 15 

To the RAM, the situation after the 1983 assassination of Ninoy 
Aquino provided the necessary political and economic preconditions that 
could ensure a successful move to oust Marcos from power. Furthermore, 
Tarrazona, a member of the 11-man Ad Hoc Steering Committee of RAM, 
wrote in 1989 that 

the signal and encouragement from the different sectors of society to unite and 
move against the dictatorship of Mr. Marcos were too loud and strong to be 
ignored. Eventually, we were subtly encouraged, if not practically pushed, by 
the Opposition groups ... to either stage a coup or start a revolution." 

On 10 July 1985, RAM officers met with concerned businessmen at 
the AFP Commissioned Officers Club in Camp Aguinaldo On 1 August, 
another group of businessmen and media people met with the RAM at 
theAssociationofGeneralandFlagOfficersBuildingin Camp Aguinaldo. 
Later, a bigger meeting was held between RAM and Manindigan at the 
Center for Research and Communication in Pasig. Other meetings 
followed with the group of Corazon C. Aquino (Cory), widow of Ninoy 
Aquino Jaime Cardinal Sin, the Manila Public School Teachers 
Association , Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster sa Pilipinas, the National 
Council of Churches in the Philippines, the American Study Mission, 
members ot the press, and many more. 17

CHAPTER IV 123 



had decided to call for a new presidential election, subsequently set for 
7 February 1986. Robles revealed three years after the EDSA Revolt 
that the RAM had planned to launch the coup against Marcos in 
December 1985, but deferred it after a "snap election" was called. Robles 
acknowledged, "So we decided to postpone [it] until sometime after 
elections around April or May in the summer." 18 However, the coup 
plotters again changed their plans, prompted by the public outrage 
against the massive election fraud. 

\ The RAM's own direct participation in the electoral process through 
its Kamalayan 1986 project must have given its members a clear idea of 
the strong anti-dictator public sentiment. Tarrazona relates that for the 
first time in the history of the Philippine military, a group of officers 
openly got involved in an election. 19 The project headed by Turingan 
promoted free, fair, and clean elections by holding rallies in military 
camps to urge AFP officers and enlisted men to remain "neutral" and to 
protect the sanctity of the ballot. This was intended to remove the public 
perception that the AFP was solidly behind Marcos. The Kamalayan 
project was secretly funded by a group of businessmen opposed to 
Marcos. The transfer of funds was arranged through Tansingco who 
collected the contributions from supporters, consigned them to SCRAM 
members in the name of retired BGen Manuel Flores (PMA '34), before 
finally handing them over to Lt Col Victor Erfe (PMA '69), designated 
custodian of RAM funds. 20 

Other Kamalayan 1986 activities included radio and personal 
campaigns, as well as requests to PMA alumni and ordinary citizens to 
write as many letters as they could to the seven top ranking AFP 
generals and their wives, askingfor honest polls, and for peace and order. 
On 12 January 1986, Tarrazona and Catapang convinced some 800 PMA 
cadets to sign about 8 ,000 pre-printed letters appealing for fair and clean 
elections. Since the PMA Superintendent, BGen Jose Ma Zumel(PMA 
'59), and the Commandant of Cadets, Col Nicasio Rodriguez (PMA '61), 
both happened to be absent that day, by coincidence or by design, 
Tarrazona and Catapang easily obtained permission to engage in this 
activity from the Assistant Commandant, Lt Col Nelson Eslao (PMA 
'71). 21 

The "snap election" provided an opportunity for various opposition 
groups to unite behind the candidacies of Cory Aquino for President and 
Salvador H. Laurel for Vice President. A citizen's watchdog organi- 
sation called National Citizens' Movement For Free Elections 
(NAMFREL) drew thousands of volunteers in a desire to have clean and 
honest polls. Election violence directed at Cory supporters as well as 



124 



NAMFREL volunteers intensified the anger against Marcos. A popular 
young e^-Governor, Evelio Javier, was brutally murdered in Antique 
while he was working for the Aquino-Laurel campaign. 

Initial results from the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) 
showed Marcos leading, but the quick count of NAMFREL favored 
Aquino. The public suspected that Marcos was going to try to cheat 
Aquino. A dramatic walkout of a group of COMELEC computer 
programmers led by Linda Kapunan, wife of Lt Col Kapunan, Enrile's 
intelligence chief and RAM inner circle member, reinforced this 
perception. Their action emphasized in the public mind the rampant 
cheating that was being done by Marcos's side. The fugitive computer 
workers were protected by RAM officers led by Kapunan, with the $id 
of 1*20,000 from Enrile. 22 On 14 February, the influential Catholic 
Bishops C onference of the Philippines (CBCP) issued a strong statement 
condemning the election fraud as being unparalleled in Philippine 
electoral history. Two days later, Mrs Aquino called for a nationwide 
boycott of "crony establishments" in a rally at Rizal Park which was 
attended by a huge crowd. Thus was launched the civil disobedience 
campaign that would take her to Cebu on 22 February. 

The "snap election" and its widely perceived fraudulent results gave 
the RAM the signal to mobilize for action all the elements they had 
painstakingly put together for many months. The arrangements were 
so clandestine that for a long time no definite date was set for its 
launching. The cue to start depended on the favorable political and 
internal military conditions that would enhance the coup's success. 

President Aquino herself revealed in a retrospective interview last 
February 1990 that her brother, Peping, had been approached by 
representatives of the RAM in "either December [1985] or early January 
[1986]" with the message that, "Your sister will never win. She may be 
popular but the votes will be manipulated and she will not win. There 
is an alternative. We are planning something and if she will join us or 
be with us. . . ." They were offering her a seat in a seven-person civilian- 
military junta to be called Council for National Reconciliation. President 
Aquino said that her immediate reaction then was to reject the offer 
because, as she recounted, "I'm not interested in being president for the 
sake of being president. I want to find out first of all if I do have the 
support of the people, so I want to go through with the election because 
they were telling me that since I would have no chance anyway, I might 
as well bow out of the race and join them in whatever they were planning 
to do." 23 President Aquino also recalled that she first met RAM officers 
Robles, Honasan, Kapunan, and Batac at an hour-long meeting on 12 



CHAPTER IV 125 



December 1985 at the house of Mila Albert, her late husband's half- 
sister. She had just come back from her first day of campaigning and 
they offered her security for the duration of the campaign. 

American author Raymond Bonner relates in his book, Waltzing 
With A Dictator, that the Aquino camp had been sought out by the RAM 
on 20 February with a proposal for a coup and subsequent junta, which 
Mrs Aquino flatly turned down. 24 It was apparently the same message 
as the one previously received by President Aquino. In any case, the 
junta would have been composed of Enrile, Ramos, Cardinal Sin, Mrs 
Aquino, businessman Jaime Ongpin, Alejandro Melchor (a former 
Executive Secretary under Marcos), and Laurel. The Council was 
supposed to be transitional and tasked to convene a Constitutional 
Convention within six months, which would then decide on the form of 
government. There was also supposed to be a committee to coordinate 
military operations in what was foreseen as a post-Marcos scenario. This 
committee was to be chaired by Ramos. 25 However, as contended by 
other people who closely followed what was going on, the Council would 
have only served as a facade for a military junta consisting of Enrile and 
his colonels. According to Professor Alfred McCoy, this was the real 
game plan designed by the coup's political committee composed of Enrile, 
his civilian aide Silvestre Afable, Robles, and Turingan. 26 

According to Arillo, the RAM's military operations plan, on the other 
hand, consisted of several scenarios, each designed to adapt to particular 
conditions. One scenario was for Enrile to make a stand in Cagayan, his 
home province, where he knew the terrain as a young guerrilla during 
the Japanese occupation, while guerrilla fighting is waged simultaneously 
in Manila and other places in Bicol, Visayas, and Mindanao. Another 
scenario was for a commando squad led by Honasan to cross the Pasig 
river and land on Malacanang grounds just after midnight. Guided by 
PSC men recruited for the purpose, Honasan's team would enter 
Malacanang and capture President and Mrs Marcos as hostages to 
prevent an all-out attack on the rebels by troops loyal to Marcos. 27 

In his testimony before the Commission, retired MGen Rodolfo 
Canieso(PMA'56), former Commanding General of the Philippine Army 
(CGPA) and Director of the NICA, said that the strike force that was 
supposed to attack Malacanang in February 1986 was to have been led 
by Kapunan, Lt Col Marcelino Malajacan (PMA 71), Maj Ricardo 
Bnllantes (PMA 72), and Maj Saulito Aromin (PMA 74). Arillo, 
however, denied that there was such a plan for a commando raid. He 
asserted that such a plan was only contingent on the possible arrest of 
wile and Ramos. 28 In an interview with McCoy on 25 July 1986, 



126 



Honasan claimed that they had "planned for every possible eventuality * 
By 7 February 1986, the RAM coup plotters had reportedly recruited 
2,500 soldiers, and organized numerous cells in many vital military 
units around Metro Manila, although lower numbers have been mentioned 
by other sources. 29 

A variation of their plan, as later revealed by Almonte, was to 
ambush and kill BGen Rolando Pattugalan (PMA '57), former AFP 
intelligence chief then commander of the 2nd Infantry Division (2 ID) in 
Tanay, Rizal, and a known Marcos man. 30 Pattugalan was generally 
considered as the candidate to replace MGen Josephus Ramas as Army 
Chief; thus an attempt on the former would, by logic, be blamed on 
Ramas, thereby sowing dissension within the Army. 

It is generally believed that the coup was scheduled to be launched 
on 22 February 1986. However, according to Robles, reputedly RAM's 
chief political strategist, they had leaked a series of possible dates to 
create confusion in the Marcos camp and to compel them to maintain a 
series of taxing security-alert situations. Furthermore, on 16 February, 
RAM leaked details of the supposed plot to kidnap the President and Mrs 
Marcos just to test the reaction of their bodyguards. 31 The mounting 
pressure of outright civil disobedience was added to the national outrage 
at the rampant electoral cheating. Rumors were everywhere that Marcos 
was on the brink of declaring martial law again and that massive arrests 
of opposition leaders and their followers would be carried out. 

At Enrile's camp, it was estimated that Marcos would probably 
reimpose martial law two or three days before he took his oath of office 
scheduled for 25 February. If he did that, Enrile would most likely be 
one of the first persons arrested because of the enormous political threat 
he represented to Marcos. It was, thus, concluded by Enrile's side that 
a preemptive move had to be carried out. Gador, then Cagayan's 
Constabulary provincial commander and an Enrile loyalist, calculated 
that the 72 hours before the Marcos inauguration fell exactly on Saturday, 
22 February. 32 

In the evening of 19 February, forces under Gador, known as the 
"Cagayan 100", began to deploy in Manila in three waves via a complicated 
route to avoid detection. Their deployment was completed by the 
afternoon of 22 February. Their mission was to neutralize the Military 
Police Brigade in Camp Aguinaldo and to secure the perimeter of the 
MND building. Other preparations were made by RAM officers to carry 
out their plan of a Malacanang assault on the early morning of 23 
February. A few days before, RAM officers were said to have withdrawn 



CHAPTER rv . 127 



all their money from the bank and left them to their families. Maj Noe 
Wong (PMA 75), RAM member and Enrile's senior aide, left his three 
children in the care of an aunt before going to his staging point. 
Tarrazona sent his wife and three children to Cavite City to stay with 
relatives there, although he had made arrangements with two friends as 
early as December 1985 to take care of them in case anything happened 
to him. Almonte's quarters in Fort Bonifacio were supposed to be the 
main staging point from where the coup participants would move on to 
Villamor Air Base (VAB). Some RAM officers were also scheduled to 
meet at Tarrazona's house in the air base where they would constitute 
the advance force. Other officers and enlisted men were supposed to 
reinforce them later to consolidate their forces at VAB, which had been 
chosen as Command Post or main operations center due to its sophisticated 
communication equipment. 33 They were later contacted to join the group 
at Camp Aguinaldo because of a change in plans. 

i 

It appears that the only time the coup plotters realized something 
had gone wrong with their plans was on Saturday morning, 22 February. 
Enrile had gone to have breakfast at the Atrium in Makati with a group 
of politicians, businessmen, and journalists, when he was called to the 
phone by then Trade and Industry Minister Roberto Ongpin. Ongpin 
toldhimthat 19 of his security men had been arrested by Marines at Fort 
Bonifacio while on "night training exercises". This allegedly worried 
Enrile as three of those men were military personnel from the Defense 
Ministry "on loan" to Ongpin to train his security unit, and unusual 
movements like those could call attention to his whole force and their 
plan for a coup. 

At about the same time (10:00 a.m.), Honasan was at his office 
behind the MND building in Camp Aguinaldo, checking reports of troop 
and armor movements in Malacafiang and other parts of Metro Manila, 
whenhe noticed two brief but vital reports. One was the move of the 5th 
Manne Battalion LandingTeam (MBLT) from Fort Bonifacio to Pandacan, 
just off the Otis entrance of Malacanang Park at 4:00 a.m., and another 
was the deployment of the 14th Infantry Battalion (14 IB) from Nueva 
fccija to North Harbor at 3:00 a.m. that same day. This meant an 
^usually high concentration of troops in Manila, in addition to those 
JM they had previously monitored. Honasan called Kapunan to his 
omce at once, where they tried but failed to reach Enrile by phone, so they 
hurriedly drove to his house instead. 

After a discussion among Enrile, Honasan, Kapunan, and Wong, 
onasan supposedly signalled all the MND security force, RAM, and 300 
"ans to be on combat readiness. Enrile then made that famous 



128 



telephone call to Ramos. At 6:30 p.m., Enrile and Ramos declared their 
withdrawal of support for Marcos at a hastily called press conference in 
Camp Aguinaldo, which angered Marcos all the more. 

At 10:30 p.m., Marcos announced at his own press conference that a 
plot to assassinate him and Mrs Marcos had allegedly been discovered 
by his son, Bongbong, and the Presidential Security Command (PSC) 
Chief of Staff, Col Irwin Ver. He said that it was aborted with the arrest 
of some officers. He accused Enrile and Ramos with having taken part 
in the plot, thus, their preemptive stand at Camp Aguinaldo to cover 
their participation. 

Marcos then presented Capt Ricardo Morales (PMA 77), chief 
security escort officer of Mrs Marcos, as the one who allegedly squealed 
to Col Ver on the rebels' plan. Morales read a prepared statement. He 
said that the plan was to enter Malacafiang and capture President and 
Mrs Marcos at 12:30 a.m. on 23 February. The attack would be staged 
from four points. Five commando teams would break through the Palace 
perimeter from the Pasig river. Malajacan, Commanding Officer of the 
16th Infantry Battalion (CO 16 IB), would lead two of his companies and 
an armor company to create a diversionary action at Malacafiang Park. 
A Ranger Force from the 49 IB would then enter Malacanang's gate on 
J P Laurel Street in a convoy of 6 x 6 trucks and a platoon of armor under 
the cover that they were reinforcements from Fort Bonifacio. This would 
be led by Aromin, CO 49 IB, with his unit from Quezon. The strategy 
supposedly would be credible since the Rangers were believed to be loyal 
to Ver. Kapunan would lead another unit that would force its way behind 
the Palace gym to cover the commandos coming in from the river. Some 
three battalions were supposed to be involved in the operation, all ledby 
RAM officers. 

Of the officers arrested, four were presented at another TV press 
conference on the morning of 23 February. These were Morales again, 
Malajacan, Aromin, and Brillantes. Aside from Enrile and Ramos, 
Moraleshad also allegedly implicated Gador, Honasan, Kapunan, Wong, 
and Maj Arsenio Santos, Jr (PMA 72), Enrile's aide. Aromin, on the 
other hand, was supposed to have confessed that he was part of five 
combat teams that were to have crossed the Pasig river to attack 
Malacafiang and kill the Marcoses. He allegedly also implicated 
Honasan, Kapunan, Malajacan, and Santos. 34 

The battle plan revealed by Morales resembles closely the commando 
raid earlier mentioned as one of RAM's options. He was obviously in a 
tight spot of some kind when he wrote a "farewell letter" to his parents 



CHAPTER IV 129 



in Davao dated 17 February, Monday. 35 Still, the general public reaction 
at the time was to initially dismiss the coup plot as just one of Marcos's 
prevaricated justifications to declare martial law, as he did in September 
1972. 

Notwithstanding the meticulous planning and attention to detail 
that the conspirators gave their coup plot, there were still apparent 
breaches in security. According to McCoy, for example, the planning 
sessions in January 1986 were conducted by Honasan and Kapunan 
almost like open seminars, with as many as 15 officers in attendance at 
a time. This seeming lack of concern for secrecy allegedly infuriated 
senior RAM officers Robles and Turingan that they demanded the 
compartmentalization of information on a need-to-know basis. 36 

It also later surfaced that PC Lt Col Rodolfo Aguinaldo (PMA 72), a 
RAM member, disclosed the names of 14 key RAM officers to his Central 
Intelligence Agency (CIA) contact at the US Embassy in an unauthorized 
meeting. Thus, those who knew of the coup plans at least a week before 
it happened included the CIA station chief and, therefore, others in the 
US Embassy, as well as the Australian Embassy. 37 The information 
might well have reached Marcos and Ver, which could explain the 
unusually high rate of troop movements in Metro Manila at the time. On 
the other hand, the increased troop movements could have been the 
prelude to a declaration of martial law and the repression of the expected 
mass resistance to it. 

Another possible source of the security leak was Maj Edgardo 
Doromal (PMA 74), Malacarlang's perimeter security officer, who was 
supposedly pressured by Honasan to join the coup plot despite his 
apparent misgivings and reluctance. Eventually, Doromal allegedly 
confessed to Irwin Ver. However, the subsequent interview by McCoy on 
25 July 1986 revealed that Honasan was convinced the breach in 
security resulted from Aguinaldo's CIA contact, who in turn passed on 
the information to Ver. 38 As Robles noted of the Americans: "They're 
shrewd when they play the game. They would bet on both sides, and they 
would win regardless." 39 

In his testimony before the Commission on 15 June 1990, BGen 
Jtemio Tadiar, Jr (PMA '59) recalled that on 19 February 1986, 
Wednesday, he was unexpectedly summoned by Malacafiang from 
jainboanga where he was inspecting troops as Commandant of the 
rhihppine Marines. The following afternoon, in a meeting at the Naval 
intelli gence Security Force headquarters in Fort Bonifacio, Ver told 
aaiar about the plan of Honasan and his men to grab power by 



130 



launching a commando raid on Malacanang, holding Marcos and his 
family as hostages and putting up their own government. Tadiar said 
Ver knew the details of the plot at least four days before the planned date 
of Honasan' s initial attack. 

Tadiar also said that Ver had received information that the Honasan 
group was allegedly planning to kill Tadiar on 21 February, Friday. 
Thus, on Friday night, some military men in full combat gear were 
arrested by Marines in a restricted area in Fort Bonifacio on suspicion 
of coming to kill Tadiar. According to Tadiar, the arrested men, 17 
enlisted personnel and one officer, turned out to be the security men of 
Minister Ongpin, led by Navy LtSG Michael Angelo Asperin (PMA'81). 
Tadiar then reported this to Ver and supposedly urged him to arrest 
Honasan and company, but Ver refused. 

The following morning, 22 February, Enrile-s office began calling 
Tadiar to inquire on the whereabouts of the arrested men. Tadiar told 
them that he had turned them over to BGen Pedro Balbanero (PMA'57), 
commander of the Military Police. It appeared that with their coup plot 
discovered and the prospect of certain arrest by Ver's men, the RAM 
officers decided to abort the coup and make a stand at Camps Crame and 
Aguinaldo. Once the decision was made, the coup plotters realized that 
they had no plan of retreat and most of their orders calling off the action 
went astray, thus leading to the capture of several RAM members. As 
Honasan himself admitted after the event, the plotters had violated 
basic military tactical principles by failing to provide for a retreat 
contingency. 40 

For the duration of the four-day revolt, the position of the Enrile- 
Ramos group would gradually be strengthened by the mobilization ofthe 
numerous RAM members and contacts in the different units ofthe four 
m^jor service commands, as well as the progressively increasing defections 
of military officers and men to the rebels' side. In the Navy, Cmdr 
Proceso Maligalig (PMA '69), then Naval Operations Assistant Chief, 
and Capt Carlito Cunanan, Naval Operating Forces Deputy Chief, who 
is the elder brother of Col Thelmo Cunanan, (PMA '61), Enrile's intelli- 
gence officer, activated upon signal "Operation Twiggy," the contingency 
plan for the RAM in the Navy. Commo Tagumpay Jardiniano (PMA'57) 
had defected early to the Enrile-Ramos camp but, like many ranking 
officers, had asked that the information be kept secret for the time being 
for security reasons. RAdm Brillante Ochoco (PMA '55), Navy Flag 
Officer in Command, did not know what was happening at the PN 
Headquarters (HQ) as he was in Malacanang most ofthe time. It was 



CHAPTER IV 131 



only after midnight of 23 February that he found out 85 percent of his 
command had shifted to the Enrile-Ramos side. 41 

In the Air Force, defections began early. At 7:00 p.m. on 22 February; 
even while Enrile and Ramos were holding their press conference, 
Tarrazona, among others, was busy contacting PAF officers to appeal for 
their support. Priority was given to commanders of flying units. Col 
Antonio Sotelo, CO of the 15th Strike Wing (15 SW), immediately 
declared support for Enrile and Ramos. In fact, as early as December 
1985, PAF Lt Col Oscar Legaspi (PMA 7 1) had contacted majority ofthe 
Air Force line pilots, including Maj Charles Hotchkiss, then commander 
of the 20th Air Commando Squadron under Sotelo. 42 It must be recalled 
that it was the 15 SW which later sent its helicopters to Camp Crame in 
a dramatic defection scene, and was responsible for the firing of rockets 
over Malacanang. 

Legaspi had also recruited Maj Francisco Baula, Jr (PMA 73), 
Squadron Commander ofthe 5th Fighter Wing (5 FW) based at Basa Air 
Base. It was he, along with two of his pilots, Lts Noe P. Linsangan (PMA 
'81) and Nestor A. Genuino, Jr (PMA '81), who flew over Camps 
Aguinaldo and Crame during the tense days of February, causing much 
apprehension and fear among the crowd below who did not know whose 
side they were on. The fighter pilots later flew to Clark Air Base, where 
their planes were "grounded" on the pretext of lack of fuel so they would 
not be used by Ver. 

Still uncertain ofthe pilots' loyalty and aware of the crucial importance 
of control of air power, the contingency plans for the capture of VAB and 
Basa Air Base were said to have been activated. The plans involved the 
capture of the two bases by the PC Special Action Force (SAF) under 
Kapunan and Lt Col Reynaldo Velasco (PMA 71), and the elements from 
the PC Training Command (PC TRACOM) led by Col Bayani Fabic 
(PMA '58). Meanwhile, Maj Arsenio Santos, Jr and Lt Andy Gauran 
(PMA '82) would launch diversionary operations nearby. To prevent the 
confusion that could arise from not knowing who were "friendly" forces 
and who were not, Kapunan came up with the idea of a Philippine flag 
patch as a countersign, changingits position clockwise everyday, starting 
with the sun on the top and the red portion on the left. It was, of course, 
assumed that the coup would not last much longer than 72 hours. 

News of other defections and support continued to pour in at Camps 
^ame and Aguinaldo on the second and third days ofthe revolt. MGen 

(M°p Per0 A ' ° liVaS (PMA ' 53) ' head ° f the Metr °P° litan Command 
^rROCOM) and Metropolitan Police Force, was an early convert but 



132 



declined to be announced just yet. Retired BGen Francisco Gatmaitan 
(PMA'52), then Manila Electric Company (MERALCO) Executive Vice 
President, pledged continuous electric power to the camps despite 
pressures from Malacanang to cut off electricity. BGen Brigido Paredes 
(PMA '60), a RAM member, recalled that he had been removed by Tadiar 
as deputy commander of the Naval Training Command on 13 February 
1986 because of his suspected RAM activities. He declared before the 
Commission that his assignment during the EDSA Revolt was to 
neutralize the Marines, to prevent them from moving against the RAM. 
The Intelligence Service of the AFP (ISAFP) was likewise "neutralized" 
by RAM officers Col Antonio Samonte (PMA '57) and Navy Capt Warlino 
Sadiarin (PMA '67), both holding key positions in the intelligence 
service. 

Aguinaldo was reported to have led the assault on Broadcast City 
by Task Force Delta, They also reportedly neutralized the loyalist 
snipers at Channel 4 and went on to provide security for Channel 7, in 
case Ver's men decided to forcibly remove the human barricades there. 
Task Force Delta was a RAM initiative to control the media stations on 
22 February, composed of elements of the Constabulary Security Group 
led by Lt Col Eduardo S. Matillano (PMA 71); a contingent of the 
Constabulary Highway Patrol Group under Lt Col Francisco Zubia, Jr 
(PMA '7 1); and a Narcotics Command contingent under Lt Col Teodorico 
Viduya(PMA'71). 

On hindsight, there are at least two noteworthy non-military- 
related factors that merit special mention in having shaped the direction 
of events and paved the way for the successful removal of Marcos in 
February 1986. First is the massive mobilization of people, now aptly 
referred to as "people power," and second is the effective media 
management. 

History has shown that the massing of people although unarmed 
could, by sheer force of numbers, radically influence the outcome of 
events. There are several historical examples within the Gandhian 
tradition and the US civil rights movement. But in the Philippines, the 
February 1986 experience is an unprecedented occurrence of the same 
phenomenon. 

It may be recalled that within four or five hours of Enrile's and 
Ramos's announced defection from the Marcos camp, there were already 
some 50,000 people surrounding Camps Crame and Aguinaldo, creating 
a formidable human barricade against any attack by Marcos troops 
against the splinter military group. In response to the continuous 



CHAPTER IV 133 



appeals aired over Radio Veritas, then later over the clandestine Radyo 
Bandido, by Cardinal Sin, and other influential civic and political 
leaders, the crowds continued to increase around the camps' perimeters, 
converting the streets and sidewalks of the areas they occupied as their 
"home" for the duration of the uprising. It was estimated that more than 
two million people gathered together. They could not be dispersed, 
despite attempts by Marcos and Ver because the military units ordered 
to disperse them were clearly reluctant to shoot at unarmed civilians. 

What many considered incredible is the fact that, despite the 
extremely tense atmosphere and the presence of armed soldiers from 
both sides, no provocation or untoward incident happened to trigger a 
bloody encounter, which would have surely killed thousands of civilians 
in the crossfire. Tarrazona recalled that a few weeks before the February 
Revolt, RAM's junior officers, among them Lts Alexander Pama (PMA 
79), George Washington Javier (PMA '80), Tadeo, Catapang, Diosdado 
Valeroso (PMA '82), and others, had coordinated with some civilian 
groups, giving them advice on how to exercise maximum tolerance 
and restraint, especially towards soldiers in crowd situations. 44 More 
importantly, the experience of NAMFREL, cause-oriented groups, and 
other volunteers in the non-violent defense of the ballot; the presence of 
nuns, seminarians and women at the front lines; and the many 
"conscientization" sessions by anti-Marcos forces over the years after 21 
August 1983 turned out to be perfect preparation for the event. Thus, no 
one taunted the tank operators or battle-tested Marines. Instead, the 
soldiers sent by Marcos's generals were offered prayers, cigarettes, food, 
drinks, and even flowers. 

Arillo's version is that the RAM had considered using human 
barricades as part of their numerous contingency plans, and that during 
the critical periods in the uprising, Enrile, Ramos, and the RAM officers 
were reluctant to mention the role of the people in the streets as they did 
not wish to expose to Malacanang any part of the defense plans for the 
two camps. 46 At Camp Crame, during the four-day uprising, Ramos's 
guidelines for then Col Alexander Aguirre (PMA '61), PC Chief of 
Operations, for the camp's defense plan included (1) to galvanize and 
make maximum use of people power and (2) to undertake no provoca- 
tive military action against the opposing side. 46 Since the Ramos 
guidelines were issued at the time that people were already massing at 
EDSA, what is undeniable is that the aborted RAM coup attempt at 
Notary intervention had been saved by people power. 

^Inhis testimony before the Commission, retired BGen Jose M. Crisol 
MA '42), former Defense Undersecretary under Presidents Magsaysay, 



134 



Garcia, and Marcos, opined that the military did not put Mrs Aquino in 
Malacariang. It was the people. He believed that Marcos's mistake was 
in attempting to bargain with the mutineers in the early hours of 23 
February, giving time for people to organize and flock to EDSA. 47 

The second notable factor that helped bring about the successful 
February 1986 EDSA Revolt is the effective and exceptional use ofthe 
media to mobilize popular support for the Enrile-Ramos group. The 
direct link of Enrile and Ramos with the masses was Radio Veritas, 
Then, it became Radyo Bandido when the Veritas radio tower was 
bombed on Ver's orders. That the public was constantly informed of what 
was happening in the camps and at EDSA for the duration of the entire 
event was half the battle won. 

From the beginning, the RAM depended heavily on radio, television, 
and newspapers to articulate their grievances and arouse the people to 
action, despite the usual constraints of censorship and political intimi- 
dation predominant under a dictatorship. Notwithstanding the existence 
of 26 television stations, 286 radio stations, and 244 newspapers 
throughout the country, there was no freedom of speech nor of the press. 
However, this did not stop the anti-Marcos opposition from coming up 
with an efficient "alternative press" and other forms of expressing 
discontent and protest, including the ingenious use of humor. 

Through the competent management of media (i.e., continuous 
coverage of events, regular press conferences, interviews, exposes, 
deliberate information leaks, and other tactical and preemptive uses of 
media), the RAM had the edge in the propaganda war. But then, winning 
the hearts and minds of the public in those days was not a very difficult 
task. More importantly, during those critical four days in February, 
military units throughout the country were informed of what was 
happening at EDSA through the media, and RAM members in the 
regional and provincial commands were provided with up-to-date 
information needed to perform activities called for by the situation. 

The February 1986 attempt may, therefore, be considered as thefirst 
attempt at military intervention in the Philippines. It was nevertheless 
aborted by the security forces of President Marcos and subsequently 
overmen by the massive outpouring of people at EDSA. Although it 
failed, theFebruaryl986cou^^

CHAPTER IV 135 



B. July 1986 Manila Hotel Incident 

Barely five months after the assumption into office of President 
Aquino, a group of armed military men and supporters of former 
President Marcos occupied the Manila Hotel for 37 hours ostensibly 
demanding constitutional reform and stronger anti-communist measures, 
on one hand, while declaring their own government, on the other. There 
were at least 490 fully-armed soldiers and some 5,000 Marcos loyalists 
who witnessed former Senator, Foreign Minister, and Marcos's Vice- 
Presidential running mate Arturo Tolentino take his "oath of office" as 
"acting President" of the Philippines on behalf of Marcos, who was then 
exiled in Hawaii. The hotel was declared as the temporary "seat of 
government". 

Tolentino said in his speech that Marcos had written him a letter 
saying that since he (Marcos) could not immediately return to the 
country, he was permitting Tolentino to take over temporarily. After 
taking his oath at the driveway of the hotel, Tolentino appointed the 
following to his "Cabinet": Rafael Recto as Justice Minister, Manuel 
Collantes as Foreign Affairs Minister, Manuel Alba as Budget Minister, 
and Isidro Rodriguez, Jr as Local Government Minister. Tolentino 
added that he was retaining Enrile as National Defense Minister, as well 
as assigning him to the position of Prime Minister so that he could 
continue the fight against the communists without any interruption." 48 
Tolentino also instructed former Speaker Nicanor Yniguez to convene 
the abolished Batasang Pambansa so it could immediately call for local 
elections before the end of the year. 

From newspaper accounts, the people who were reportedly present 
at Manila Hotel for the takeover were a curious mix of military men and 
civilians, whose outstanding common trait was their loyalty to Marcos. 
™ong the military men who were there were: Ochoco; Olivas; Zumel; 
Agumaldo; BGen Antonio Palafox, former Commander, 5 ID based in 
p ac; BGen J ™e Echeverria (PMA '57), former Regional Unified 

iSSnn? UC) 12 Chief; 001 R ° land ° Abadilla (PMA ' 65) > former 
aaUCOM Intelligence and Security Group head; Maj Reynaldo 

w Kolando de Guzman (PMA '61); Col Dictador Alqueza (not Arquiza 
reported in the newspapers), of Jabidah fame and later Samar 
™der; BGen Tomas Dumpit (PMA '57), former RUC 1 Commander; 

cerL n * ernardo Patino > Jr (PMA '67); Lt Pablo Cardenas; and a 
certain Capt Cardenas. 



136 



Aside from Tolentino and Yniguez, among the other civilian 
personalities there were: ex-Members of Parliament Gerry Espina, 
Salvador Britanico, Manuel Collantes, and Manuel Alba; former 
Commissioner of Immigration and Deportation Edmundo Reyes; ex-Gov 
of Rizal Isidro Rodriguez, Jr, ex-Gov of Zambales Vicente Magsaysay; 
ex-Mayor of Quezon City Adelina Rodriguez; ex-Mayor of San Juan and 
now Senator Joseph Estrada; ex-Central Bank Governor Gregorio 
Licaros; ex-Manila Vice Mayor Felicisimo Cabigao; former MIA manager 
Luis Tabuena; ex-Mayor of Kalookan Macario Asistio (subsequently 
elected Mayor); Batangas Fiscal Felizardo Lota; lawyers Rafael Recto 
and Oliver Lozano; Gerry Sto Domingo; entertainment personalities 
Alona Alegre, Elizabeth Oropeza, Annie Ferrer, Amalia Fuentes, 
Mohamad Faizal, and Weng Weng; Chito Lucero; Sonia Valenzuela; 
Edilberto del Valle; Carlos Salazar; Rio Diaz; Rick Soriano; Pol Genatin; 
and many more. 

The coup plotters had evidently timed their actions. The Manila 
Hotel takeover came in the wake of massive student unrest in the 
colleges and universities of Metro Manila, as the Education Ministry had 
reportedly failed to respond to the students* call for a moratorium on 
mass protest actions. The peasants were restive, despite the 
announcement of the government's proposed agrarian reform package 
for Communist Party of the Philippines/New People's Army (CPP/NPA) 
rebel-returnees the day before the Manila Hotel incident. The AFP was 
very critical of President Aquino's ceasefire efforts with the CPP/NPA 
There were increasingly strong pressures against so-called "leftists" in 
the Cabinet. The Constitutional Commission was still in the process of 
formulating the new Constitution, which would replace the Freedom 
Constitution in effect since March 1986. The President was preparing 
for her state visit to the US, and the important issues of the day were 
national recovery and the adoption of a new constitution. 

The occupation of the hotel was premeditated and intentional. A day 
or two before the incident, Tolentino reportedly checked into four 
adjoining rooms on the 14th floor of the hotel, all registered under a 
woman's name. Other Marcos supporters also checked into different 
rooms under assumed names. Codes were used in communicating with 
each other. They planned to use the MacArthur Suite as their command 
post. Plastic bags of rice and even water were later found in the rooms, 
showing that the rebels were prepared to hold out at the hotel. 

It is likewise clear that the takeover plan was known to some high- 
ranking officers in the military establishment even before it was actually 
carried out. In his testimony before the Commission on 15 June 1990, 



CHAPTER IV 137 



Tadiar revealed that he knew about the plot in advance because Zumel 
had tried to enlist his and BGen Luther Custodio's participation in it. He 
said he had refused and had remained in his quarters instead, although 
his name was later announced on the radio as being at Manila Hotel. 
Kapunan, Enrile's intelligence chief, also knew about the plan at least 
several hours before the incident happened. American writer McCoy 
disclosed that he was waiting in the house of Kapunan for an interview 
on the morning of 6 July. Kapunan arrived in combat uniform, apologizing 
for being late "because the Marcos loyalists are going to seize Manila 
Hotel in a coup. . . n5 ° Six hours later, the Marcos supporters did in fact 

takeoverthehotel,takingthegovernment,atleastthecivilian branches, 
by surprise. 

In the morning of Sunday, 6 July 1986, Recto, Yniguez, Espina, and 
other Marcos followers were seen conferring at the 365 Club of Manila 
Intercontinental Hotel. Their meeting was interrupted by the arrival of 
Jack Anderson, a visiting Washington journalist. The loyalists invited 
him to attend their rally that afternoon, where they promised him a 

scoop.* 61 Just after 4:00 p.m. that day, while the loyalists were holding 
tor rally at the Quirino Grandstand, some 100 fully-armed soldiers in 

atigue uniforms accompanied by dozens of civilians suddenly barged 
through the doors of the Manila Hotel and commandeered the lobby, 
toel approached Mike Wilson, thehotel's Food and Beverage Manager, 
and told him that they were taking over the hotel. In a short time, the 
group had swelled to about 300. 

By around 5:00 p.m., Tolentino arrived at the lobby (presumably 
ttora his room upstairs). After a table and microphone system were set 
up, Tolentino took his "oath of office*. Tolentino later claimed that he 
nad no personal stake in what they had done, and was only after the 
Atl progress of the People under constitutionalism, democracy 
ana the rule of law." 62 The rest of the evening was spent on fiery speeches

By late Sunday, 6 July, the loyalists had managed to commandeer 
several buses and to barricade Roxas Boulevard, P Burgos Street, 
Bonifacio Drive, and T M Kalaw Street. Inside the hotel, Gerry Sto 
Domingo, former Assistant Executive Manager of Manila Hotel and 
nephew of Edmundo Reyes, declared that he was taking over hotel 
management, while Capt Cardenas, Detachment Commander ofFairways 
Security Agency which was owned by Ver, announced he was going to 
handle the hotel's security. 

There were vague, conflicting versions about the identity of the rebel 
troops that occupied Manila Hotel. A number of newspaper accounts 
mention that there were two companies of soldiers inside the hotel, and 
some hotel employees said they kept hearing the name of the 225th PC 
Company. Others said the troops were mostly displaced members of the 
PSC under Ver, or a motley combination of security guards of Marcos 
loyalists and ex-cronies. The ones in full battle gear, with insigniasof the 
Special Forcesand black headbands, were said to be Guardian members. , 
They had red, white, and blue ribbons tied around the muzzles of their 
rifles. There were also rebel troops that reportedly took positions behind 
the grandstand, wearing red and black patches bearing campaign 
portraits of Marcos and Tolentino. Several reports added that soldiers 
and policemen from RUC 3 in Camp Olivas, Pampanga trooped to 
Manila on Sunday evening upon being told that they "were to participate 
in a revolt against the Aquino government sanctioned by Minister Enrile 
and Chief of Staff Ramos." 54 They had evidently been fooled. When they 
heard over the radio that Enrile and Ramos were on the President's side 
and organizing the military response to them, they surrendered at once 
to Capital Regional Command (CAPCOM) Commander BGen Ramon 
Montano. Furthermore, the rebels were also reported to have had 
different types of firearms, ranging from M16 assault rifles and M79 
grenade launchers, to three .30 cal machine guns mounted at the lobby. 

It is obvious that Malacanang had no inkling of the coup plot. 
President Aquino was in Cagayan de Oro with Ramos and PC Chief 
MGen Renato de Villa (PMA '57) when it happened. When Executive 
Secretary Joker Arroyo found out about it through his own sources, he 
immediately tried to contact Enrile who was out. He left an urgent 
message. Then, he called GHQ and spoke with Vice Chief of Staff Lt Gen 
Salvador Mison (PMA '55), who said they were aware of the situation and 
were assessing it. Meanwhile, Enrile got back to Arroyo who apprised 
him of the situation. Enrile denied knowing anything about it, but said 
he would attend to it right away. After several more calls to verify 
information, Arroyo contacted President Aquino in Cagayan de Oro, 
who said Ramos had told her about it, from Mison's report to him. It was 



CHAPTER IV 139 



then decided that Ramos would rush back to Manila, while President 
Aquino continued with her original schedule of visiting military camps, 
as well as receiving 20 rebel returnees in Cagayan de Oro, before flying 
back to Manila on 7 July. 

Enrile summoned the General Staff for a Command Conference at 
GHQ at 7:00 p.m. to map out tactics to deal with the situation. After the 
conference, he met with the press. Enrile and the military top brass 
sought to make light of the event, and even presented Tadiar and 
Pattugalan to dispel rumors that they had joined the rebels. Enrile 
added that Custodio was at home, and not at Manila Hotel as had been 
rumored. 

In the meantime, government troops (Marines) had set up checkpoints 
and blocking forces on all the roads leading to Manila Hotel, and had 
supposedly cordoned off all routes within a one-kilometer radius. 
However, journalist Belinda Cunanan claimed that the Marine blockades 
were not really effective in preventing food and human traffic to the 
hotel. She managed to visit the premises at about noon on 7 July. 56 By 
that time, however, water and electrical power had been cut off in the 
hotel. Employees left inside had earlier refused to connect telephone 
calls and deliberately dismantled the hotel's public address system. 

Elsewhere, Quezon City Officer-in-Charge (OIC) Brigido Simon, Jr 
reported that loyalists were allegedly recruiting residents in the 
Commonwealth Avenue, Holy Spirit, and Batasan Hills areas to support 
those holed up in Manila Hotel. 66 The National Telecommunications 
Commission temporarily closed down radio stations DZME, DZEC, 
DZXL, and DWAD for irresponsible reporting of the incident and for 
"being conduits of loyalists' messages to their followers". This act 
received some public and media flak for its perceived encroachment on 
the freedom of speech. For its part, the Armed Forces leadership relieved 
Cabauatan as Home Defense Chief of the Central Luzon Regional 
Command on 7 July, for abandoning his post. 

At 2:00 p.m. on 7 July, President Aquino issued a public statement 
on the Marcos loyalists' failed "propaganda gimmick". She assured the 
People that the situation was under control. She gave the public a quick 
update on the incident and an ultimatum to the loyalists, allowing them 
M hours (until 2:00 p.m., 8 July) to give themselves up. President 
%ino also issued strong warnings that "the law will not be flouted with 
impunity," and that "an incident like this will not be allowed to happen 
^ain." She further announced that there would be "closer monitoring 
ot loyalists and other similarly subversive activities from here on". 57 



140 



In a closed-door meeting with the joint staff, major service 
commanders and Metro Manila police superintendents on the afternoon 
of 7 July at the Navy Headquarters, two strategies were discussed to end 
the Manila Hotel fiasco. One called for a lightning attack on that day, 
before the 24-hour grace period to surrender expired. The other, which 
was already partially in effect, was to completely isolate the loyalists in 
the hotel from their outside supporters by severing the electricity and 
communications system and by blocking all the roads leading to the hotel 
to prevent supplies of food, water, medicine, etc, from getting to the 
loyalists. 

That the whole exercise was a lost cause must have dawned on the 
loyalistleadership early on. Just a day after he took his "oath" as a acting 
President", Tolentino shunned responsibility, claiming he "had no role 
in planning this." He contended he was pressured by supporters of 
Marcos to take his oath. At a press conference in the hotel, Tolentino 
seemed to adopt a conciliatory stance when he urged President Aquino 
to call for early elections, sayingmany were "restless". He further added, 
"We do not want the restoration of a constitutional government by 
violence or by force. That is farthest from our thoughts." 58 

A few hours after the President issued her ultimatum, Tolentino and 
some others began negotiating with government representatives at the 
Army and Navy Club. The loyalist leaders among the military, Zumelj 
Echeverria and Palafox, and among the civilians, Tolentino, Yniguez, 
Recto, and Britanico, either did not bother to return to Manila Hotel from 
the talks, or left the hotel shortly after. 59 Among the leaders who were 
left behind, Abadilla and Alqueza at first wanted to hold out until the 
2:00 p.m. deadline on 8 July, despite the previous consensus among 
senior loyalist leaders to surrender earlier. The second set of negotiations 
were held at the police detachment behind the Quirino Grandstand and 
were attended by President Aquino's son, Noynoy, Honasan, and 
Montano's deputies, Col Emiliano Templo (PMA '52) and Col Cesar 
Nazareno (PMA '61), for the government side. 

As it turned out, Abadilla, Alqueza, and Cabauatan left Manila 
Hotel at 4:30 a.m. on 8 July, about an hour ahead of the evacuation 
schedule, fetched by Enrile's security men, Honasan and Kapunan. 60 At 
a.m Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) security 
personnel and CAPCOM men arrived at the hotel to supervise the 
evacuation of the loyalists. Ten Metro Manila Transit buses fetched 180 
soiaiers from the rear entrance, while more or less 300 civilians were 
quietly advised to disperse. Tolentino himself never came back to 



CHAPTER IV 141 



witness the evacuation at 5 :45 a.m. on 8 July, some eight hours before the 
deadline. 

From the start, despite the strong presidential statement, the 
government attitude towards the rebels at Manila Hotel seemed to be 
of maximum tolerance. They were promised that no criminal or military 
charges would be filed against them if they surrendered within the 24- 
hour limit set by the President. Enrile disclosed that he had been 
contacted at his office on 7 July by some leaders of the troops occupying 
Manila Hotel, signifying their intention to break from Tolentino' s group. 
He therefore arranged for some sort of processing center to be set up at 
the grandstand where these men could be received. He assigned 
Honasan to escort the loyalist officers and men out of the hotel towards 
the receiving area. Claiminghe had clearance from the President, Enrile 
assured the "returning" soldiers that the government would exercise 
"maximum leniency without any embarrassment, humiliation against 
any of them, and they would be taken back into our organization without 
prejudice to their status as military personnel." 61 

At the formal acceptance of surrender of the Marcos loyalist troops 
atFort Bonifacio gymnasium on 8 July, Ramos welcomed the surrenderees 
(including four generals and 69 troopers) back to the fold of the AFP. He 
declared them free from liability of any crime against the Republic and 
the Armed Forces. He then ordered them to do 30 push-ups. However, 
based on testimony received in Executive Session, the push-ups were 
done to relieve the tension. Enrile, on the other hand, reiterated his 
promise of virtual exoneration by saying, "No punishment will come your 
way. I stand on this even to the point of gambling my position to see to 
it that what we have promised you will be fulfilled." He added further, 
"There will be no retaliation against you. We shall consider this as past. 
Let us forget as though nothing had happened." 62 

On 9 July, upon the Cabinet's recommendation, President Aquino 
announced her offer of clemency (i.e., non-filing of criminal charges) to 
the Marcos supporters who took over Manila Hotel, on condition that 
"they take the oath of loyalty to the Freedom Constitution." There were 
those who thought the pardon was premature before a full-dress inquiry 
could be carried out. In other words, it was felt that the loyalists were 
let off too easily. This was in stark contrast to the treatment given a 
group of unarmed civilians who demonstrated in front of the US Embassy 
just a week before, on 4 July. The demonstrators were violently 
dispersed by truncheons, tear gas, and guns because, as P/BGen Alfredo 
Lim later reasoned out, they were blocking both lanes of Roxas 
Boulevard. 63 



142 



On the other hand, there were people who thought that punishing 
the loyalists would hamper the government's campaign for national 
reconciliation and would only give loyalist leaders a chance to be 
"martyrs". Expressing the prevailing sentiment in the Cabinet, then 
Political Affairs Minister Antonio Cuenco said that resorting to court 
trials at that time would have been highly divisive and would only have 
allowed the loyalists the exposure in court and in the media they 
wanted. 64 

Two of the arguments used for adopting a policy of maximum 
leniency towards the loyalists was that no shot was fired and that no 
casualties resulted from the incident. A damage assessment after the 
incident, however, showed that the Manila Hotel suffered an estimated 
loss of T10 million, including the physical and material damage to the 
facilities, the looting of supplies, and loss of revenue from cancelled 
bookings. There were also losses resulting from the vandalized buses the 
rebels commandeered to barricade the streets ardund the hotel on the 
first night of their coup. Loyalists were, likewise, reported to have 
attacked a news patrol jeep outside the hotel early on 7 July, resulting 
in injury to two people. Furthermore, the Ministry of Tourism said at 
least 670 reservations made by prospective foreign visitors with various 
big hotels in Metro Manila had been cancelled following the incident. 66 

Although there was no deadline set for the swearing of allegiance 
to the Freedom Constitution, mass oathtaking ceremonies were held on 
27 July, This was attended by many of those in the military who were 
implicated in the Manila Hotel incident, 66 and who were eventually 
retired from the service. On the same day, the police filed formal charges 
of rebellion against Tolentino, 25 other civilians and 15 soldiers. The 
charges were based on the recommendations of Wes tern Police District 
Superintendent Lim, who supposedly conducted an investigation of 
the incident. Even then, negotiations were going on between the accused 
and the government. Justice Minister Neptali Gonzales drew up the 
following conditions for dropping the charges against the loyalists: (D 
pledge of allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines and maintenance 
of fidelity; (2) recognition of the existence of the present government 
under the Freedom Constitution; (3) renunciation of the use of force and 
violence for the overthrow of the government; and (4) not to allow one's 
name or one's self to be used directly or indirectly for such purposes. The 
accused must have accepted the terms because eventually all the 
charges were dropped against them. 

On 17 July 1986, President Aquino created an ad hoc Presidential 
Fact-Finding Committee to investigate the Manila Hotel incident, funded 



CHAPTER IV 143 



from the Special Activities Fund. The Committee was composed of 
Alfredo Bengzon as chairman, with Rafael Ileto, Jesus Ayala, Emanuel 
Soriano, and Fulgencio Factoran, Jr as members. This group worked for 
three months, interviewing numerous people and meeting almost daily 
at the Manila Hotel. The Committee submitted a three-page First 
Report within a week and a four-page Second Report three weeks later, 
but instead of a final report, the Committee gave the President an oral 
report based on a discussion outline. 67 The major findings in the First 
Report included the following: (1) even as early as in May or June 1986, 
some members of the press had already been told or had heard of the plan 
of the pro-Marcos group to execute the Manila Hotel affair in exactly the 
manner that it actually happened; (2) the intelligence agencies in the 
military establishment failed to effectively monitor the movements from 
San Fernando, Pampanga of the military contingent that participated in 
the incident; and (3) none of the existing intelligence agencies, either 
civilian or military, had evaluated the activities previous to the attempt, 
specifically the Sunday rallies of the pro-Marcos groups and opposition 
politicians in relation to what could happen. The recommendation in the 
First Report was, therefore, the immediate establishment of an inde- 
pendent intelligence agency under the President's personal, direct, and 
exclusive direction and control. 

The Second Report had a more extensive assessment of the event. 
The findings included the following: 

1. The Manila Hotel incident was a pre-planned or pre-meditated 
conspiracy. [For example, at least three days before 6 July 1986, 
Honasan already knew about the loyalist plan.] 58 

2. The conspirators fell into two groups or categories: 

a. those who openly identified themselves and admitted parti- 
cipation (open conspirators); and 

b. those who even after the incident took every measure 
to conceal their identities and involvement (hidden 
conspirators). 

3. There was a breakdown in the capabilities of the intelligence 
agencies. They were unable to forecast the event. [Up to the time 
of the Second Report (14 August 1986), they apparently had not 
been able to identify the hidden conspirators.] 

4. The main objective of the Manila Hotel incident was propaganda- 

related, specifically intended to embarrass the Aquino admi- 
nistration. However, the event was so planned and structured 



144 



that, depending on the response of the military, it could have 
readily been transposed to an actual takeover or coup d' etat 
operation. 

5. As of the time of the report, the main thrust and principal 
philosophy of the incident's exercise still existed (i.e., a propa- 
ganda event with a built-in mechanism for ready transition to 
a takeover operation). 

6. The military as an institution was not involved in the incident. 
The military establishment, however, is presently fragmented 
by four major factional groups which, if not hostile to each other, 
are in the least seriously undermining the morale of the entire 
organization. The four groups are the RAM, the Guardians, the 
BROTHERS (Brotherhood of Officers Towards Harmony, Equa- 
lity and Reform in the Service), and IROG (Integree and Reserve 
Officers Group). The existence of factions in the military, in 
itself , poses serious political and security problems for the 
government because they operate outside the traditional and 
formal chain of command. 

7. The impending visits then of President Aquino to the ASEAN 
countries and the US raised high risks of another, if not more 
serious, Manila-Hotel-incident type of occurrence. 

8. The handling of the incident by the government, particularly the 
seemingly contradictory and independent pronouncements made 
by civilian and military officials, notably Enrile and Ramos, on 
one hand, and those from the Justice Ministry, on the other, was 
perceived by the general public as reflections of the Admi- 
nistration's indecisiveness and weakness. On the whole, such 
handling of the incident substantially eroded public confidence 
in the stability of the government. This is especially true with 
respect to the perceived lax treatment of the high-ranking 
military officers who openly participated in the attempt. 

9. As of the time of the Second Report, the following remained 
unknown: 

a. the hidden conspirators 

b. the extent and sophistication of the command structure of 
the hidden conspirators' organization 

c. the nature and system of linkage with Ferdinand Marcos 

d. funding source, and logistical system and distribution 



CHAPTER IV 145 



e. the manner and nature of the possible future Manila-Hotel- 
incident type events 

f. the "JPE" [Juan Ponce Enrile] factor 

The recommendations of the Committee in the Second Report were 
the following: 

1. As previously recommended, establish an intelligence capability 
with the President's full confidence, directly taking instructions 
from and reporting to President Aquino. 

2. An in-depth review of all existing intelligence agencies to be 
conducted immediately with particular emphasis on their 
personnel. 

3. Use the National Security Council (NSC) as was constituted at 
the time, as the cover for the President's Command Structure in 
case of emergency during her absence in August and September 
1986. 

4. Order the immediate dismantlement of the organized factions 
in the military. 

5. Direct the Ministry of Justice to review the present disposition 
of the known or open participants in the Manila Hotel incident. 

6. Direct the immediate and effective actions to be taken against 
the notorious open participants in a manner that will serve 
exemplary and deterrent purposes. 

7. That the Presidential Fact-Finding Committee, in coordination 
with the proposed President's intelligence unit, investigate 
more fully the unknowns mentioned in the findings of the Second 
Report. 

A list of names of civilians and military men was submitted for all 
intelligence agencies concerned to closely monitor their activities. 

According to Soriano in his testimony before the Commission in July 
19 90, of the seven recommendations mentioned above, only number 2 
was substantially implemented, number 3 was partially fulfilled by 
p net Cluster E, while numbers 5 and 6 became moot when the 
resident granted clemency and all the charges against the accused 
loyalists were dropped. Despite the order from the AFP leadership 



146 



prohibiting unauthorized organizations in the military and disbanding 
the existing ones, there continue to be clandestine organized groups 
within the Armed Forces, as evidenced by the appearance of new ones 
like the Young Officers Union (YOU). Thus, number 4 has not been 
effectively implemented. As for numbers 1 and 7, there has been no new 
intelligence unit created under the President. It was decided instead to 
use the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA) for this 
purpose. 

The reactions from different countries within the region, judging 
from various editorials and articles in foreign newspapers, clearly 
stressed the need to be benevolent but firm in handling the rebels. He 
idea that the leaders of the attempt must answer for their deeds lest 
they be tempted to try again," was a common opinion in the editorials. 
The US praised President Aquino's "deft handling" of the aborted coup 
and reaffirmed their full support for her administration. However, 
despite its declared policy of non-interference, US embassy spokesman 
Allan Croghan confirmed that a US vice consul (Ambassador Stephen 
Bosworth was on leave at the time) had privately conferred with 
Tolentino during the loyalists' occupation of Manila Hotel. But Cretan 
reasoned, "We do it every time [something like this develops] to get an 
appraisal of the situation." 69 

Perhaps, the most significant indication of the public sentiment 
towards the Manila Hotel incident was the fact that people general^ 
went about their own business, unaffected by the loyalists' call for 
i Qft^™ I** loyalists were apparently trying to re-enact the February 
198b bDSA Revolt, even claiming that thousands of Marcos followers 
were on their way to support them, and that units of the AFP would be 
detecting But they were utterly disappointed. The majority of Filipinos 
were still caught up in the optimism of EDSA, and the Presidents 
popularity continued to be high. People believed her when, a week after 
the attempt, she assured them that, "Definitely, no repetition of Sunday 
(incident) will be allowed to take place. And this is something I am 
committing myself to in collaboration with the entire government and 
the support of the Filipino people."" It was the first major test on the 
stability of the Aquino administration, and although it passed the 
ordeal, some say it may have revealed a sign of weakness and indecision 
in the complete exoneration of the rebels. 

C November 1986 "God Save The Queen Plot" 

afteSm?A m p einb ^™ be J ieVed that the **** should have disbanded 
after the EDSA Revolt in February 1986 because its principal goal of 



CHAPTER IV 147 



ousting Marcos had already been achieved. However, some of its officers 
resisted this move and, instead, actively continued to plot a coup d'etat. 71 
This splinter group shall be referred to as the RAM-Honasan Faction 
(RAM-HF). 

The Philippine political climate was turbulent in the months prior 
to the discovery of the coup plot codenamed "God Save The Queen" in 
November 1986. Just four months earlier, the government had quelled 
theloyalist attempt at ManilaHotel. The ratification of the Constitution, 
scheduled for February 1987, continued to be a principal preoccupa- 
tion of the administration, which was fully aware that a new Charter 
endorsed by the majority of the voters would enhance the government's 
legitimacy and, therefore, stability. At this point, too, there appeared to 
be constantinfightingamongCabinet members, afact which the energetic 
press constantly highlighted. Defense Minister Enrile, the Admi- 
nistration's most outspoken critic, was also denouncing everything from 
President Aquino's "soft approach" toward the insurgency problem, to 
the provisions of the Constitution. 

The visit to Manila of US Congressman Stephen Solarz on the first 
week of November may have exacerbated the growing schism between 
the President and Enrile. Commenting on the Cabinet imbroglio, the 
press quoted Solarz as having said that it would be better for the 
President to sack Enrile as soon as possible. This unsolicited advice drew 
negative reactions not only from the Enrile camp but also from other 
sectors, which viewed the congressman's comment as American inter- 
ference in Philippine internal affairs. 

Meanwhile, Marcos loyalists continued their public demonstrations 
for the return of Marcos and his family. There was a rash of bombings 
in different parts of Metro Manila, adding to the people's anxiety. Also 
at this time, peace negotiations between the government and the CPP/ 
NPAwere ongoing. 

On the economic side, negotiations between the Philippine govern- 
ment and foreign banks for the restructuring of about $ 12 billion in loan s 
had bogged down. Reports indicated that foreign bankers were appre- 
hensive over the political situation and bickerings in the Aquino Cabinet 
and laid down stiff preconditions for postponing payments on maturing 
loans, prompting then Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin to recess the 
negotiations. The Philippine panel was asking for a reduction in 
^terests, extension of repayment from ten to 20 years, and a multi-year 
structuring for some $6 billion in debts falling due between 1987 and 



148 



Foreign businessmen and potential investors expressed their 
anxieties over the country's political situation. Coup and counter-coup 
rumors dominated the headlines as well as coffee shop discussions, 
heightening the general political and economic instability. President 
Aquino faced a dilemma of postponing or pushing through with h$r 
four-day state visit to Japan scheduled for the second week of November. 

Because of the continuous flow of intelligence information and 
disinformation on coup plots, Chief of Staff Ramos called periodic 
meetings among the major service commanders to assess the situation 
and receive intelligence service briefings from the different sectors of the 
military. The same names seemed to be cropping up as coup plotters: 
Honasan, Kapunan, Turingan, Batac, Robles, et al. Although Enrile's 
name never appeared in any of the reports, most of the military officers 
mentioned were closely identified with him. 73 It was reported that the 
plotters made a special effort to recruit officers who directly commanded 
combat units. 

The Commanding General of a major service (CG- witness) testified 
before the Commission that he first heard about the coup plot from 
Enrile himself (although he claims it was not yet known as "God Save 
The Queen"). Around the middle of October 1986, Enrile, who had 
arnvedfromCebu, told CG- witness that he wanted to see him. A week 
later, Legaspi was sent to fetch CG-witness to bring him to the MND 
reception hall, where he and Enrile met for around ten minutes. Enrile 
supposedly told CG-witness that his (Enrile's) position was becoming 
more untenable in government. Enrile allegedly said that the government 
was in bad shape and "it's about time that we take back the authority we 
gave them." 74 CG-witness claimshe informed Gen Ramos about the visit 
on the following day, although he was sure Ramos had received intelli- 
gence reports about the coup by then. 

On 4 November, a week before the President was to leave for Japan, 
Legaspi fetched CG-witness to attend a gathering at Paredes's house in 
Fort Bonifacio. The gathering has been described as an "invitation to a 
briehng" as well as a celebration of Paredes's promotion to star rank 
which had been announced a day or two before, although he had been 
Marine Commandant since the EDSA Revolt. Among the other people 
at the party were MGen Canieso, CG PA; MGen Antonio Sotelo, CG PAF; 
lunngan; Honasan; Robles; and some others. After a while, Enrile 
arrived to join them. Because of the passage of time the sworn testimonies 
do not purport to quote verbatim the discussions that night, but they 
establish references to the coup plot now referred to as "God Save The 
Wiieen . E nnle was reportedly the one who confirmed the launching 



CHAPTER IV 149 



time and date as 12:00 midnight of 11 November, several hours after 
President Aquino was to have left for her state visit to Japan. 75 It was 
said that their individual roles in the coup were not discussed that 
evening although a tacit message to the key holders of power (i.e., the 
commanding generals) was that if they were not willing to support the 
coup, they should remain "neutral" and not prevent their men from 
joining it. There is testimony alleging that the plotters had previously 
distributed radios and money (1*50,000 each) to four sector commanders 
who were supposed to impose curfew while conducting "surgical" 
operations against leftists. 76 

The coup plot appeared to be a rehash of the original plan against 
Marcos in February 1986, using a commando team to raid Malacanang, 
capture President Aquino, and pressure her to yield the powers of the 
presidency while nominally retaining the title and ceremonial role. Two 
units were supposed to be involved in the operation — the Marines and 
the Arm/s 1st Light Armor Brigade (1 LABde). It is not known where 
the codename "God Save The Queen" came from, but it could be 
conjectured that it is an updated version of the earlier plan known as 
"God Save The King" (referring to Marcos). 

Through at least two sources other than the military intelligence 
community (which gave no early-warning report to its Commander-in- 
Chief), Malacanang found out about the coup plot so the PSG was 
immediately placed and remained on red alert throughout those cri- 
tical weeks of November. President Aquino had summoned Marine 
Commandant Paredes and the commander of the 1 LABde to ask them 
if she could count on them. Both had allegedly replied in the affirmative. 
Sotelo, Canieso, and Jardiniano were also called to Malacaiiang for 
consultations with the President and Arroyo, presumably to ascertain 
their loyalties. News of the coup plot broke into the headlines of the 
Ph^PPinft Daily Trjg ^jr er on 9 November. It was a deliberate leak to 
convey a message to the coup plotters that their plan was known. 77 

Ramos called Deputy Chief of Staff MGen Eduardo Ermita (PMA 
57), as well as Mison, de Villa, Jardiniano, Sotelo, and Canieso, to a 
meeting at GHQ, after which they went to see Enrile, with whom they 
supposedly talked about the perception that some Cabinet members 
were anti-military. Enrile was said to have shown impatience with the 
government's handling of national affairs and the insurgency problem. 
Jney ended up by signing a resolution urging President Aquino to 
consider seriously the replacement of those Cabinet members". One 
testimony claimed that the top echelon of the military went to see Enrile 
tw o or three times, allegedly to dissuade him and his "boys" from 



150 



carrying out their plan. Another testimony pointed out that military 
officers do not engage in direct confrontations, but use subtle and 
indirect remarks. 78 In one of these "persuasion visits", they supposedly 
used the tack "we'll do it together," but that the time was not yet right 
for it. To buy more time, Ramos was reported to have even suggested 
doing it after the Christmas season when everyone would be tired of 
merrymaking. 79 Enrile was apparently dissuaded. 

However, Enrile was reportedly angered by what President Aquino 
said during a Dental Association conference which she addressed on the 
morning of her trip to Japan. He was said to have walked out of the 
conference and ordered the hoisting of flags at the MND, which was 
presumably a signal to launch the coup that night. 80 

Despite the advice of both Ramos and Canieso not to leave for Japan 
because a somethingwasgoingtohappen,"PresidentAquino nevertheless 
left for her state visit as scheduled. Immediately after her departure, 
Ramos and the four major service commanders met at the VIP Lounge 
at the airport. They discussed the intelligence ( J-2) report about the coup 
plot and agreed on the preparations for their respective commands. 

According to CG-witness, it was only at 12:00 midnight of 11 
November that Ramos felt assured that the service commanders were 
with him. He believed that Ramos was not really certain of ho w the other 
generals would act. At the last minute, Enrile was supposed to have 
called off the coup, since none of the commanding generals were on his 
side. Thus, there was no overt movement of forces on 11 November, 
although preparations were allegedly made at Camp Aguinaldo. Honasan 
was said to have mobilized about ten V-150s and as many as 800 men 
(security forces of the MND), without counting possible outside support 81 

The day before President Aquino's arrival from Japan, Ramos again 
called for an emergency command conference at 4:00 a.m. with the four 
service commanders. They received a briefing from J-2 about reports 
that the MND Security Group and other units they had recruited were 
again ready to take action early the next morning. During the meeting, 
Ramos made several calls to Honasan, Turingan and some others. At 
10:00 a.m., Ramos went to see Enrile to prevail upon him to stop his 
Tx>ys . 

During that period, the Command Center (Joint Operations Center 
a n /v! receiving reports of troop movements, despite orders to stop* 
At 1:00 p.m., Ramos and then Deputy Minister Ileto went to see Enrile 
but apparently to no avail. Ileto had supposedly also tried, but was 



CHAPTER IV 151 



unsuccessful, to dissuade Honasan from carrying out their plan, using 
their personal links (Honasan's father and Ileto were classmates, and 
their families have always been close). 82 

As a last resort, Ramos and the four service commanders went to see 
Enrile at 4:30 p.m. and reviewed the situation with him. Enrile was 
supposed to have asked what he should do, and as everyone was silent, 
Ramos allegedly signaled Canieso, being the most senior of the CGs, to 
give the collective opinion. Canieso supposedly told Enrile that whatever 
happened, the whole AFP would take measuresin favor of the government 
as this was their duty. After a brief silence, Enrile reportedly excused 
himself and went into the other room. Shortly after, he returned and 
allegedly capitulated, saying nothing will happen. The five generals 
then left and returned to the JOC. They were said to have reviewed their 
plans and then went back to their respective headquarters. 83 

Upon the return of President Aquino from Japan, another crisis 
awaited her. KilusangMayoUno(KMU) Chairman Rolando Olalia was 
abducted by unidentified men and his tortured and bullet-ridden body 
was found in a vacant lot in Antipolo, while that of his driver, Leonor 
Alay-ay, was discovered three kilometers away. The brutal killing on the 
eve of the President's return led to a nationwide protest, where labor and 
other cause-oriented groups denounced the military as the perpetrators 
of the crime. Accusations varied from the alleged desire of the military 
to break up the ongoing negotiations for a ceasefire with the communists, 
to the military's intention to inflame the people's anger towards the 
government so that the climate would be favorable for a coup d'etat. 

President Aquino formed Task Force Olalia to investigate the case. 
This was headed by National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Director 
Antonio Carpio, in the absence of Justice Minister Gonzales. The NBI 
found proof of military involvement in the stake out and surveillance 
of Alalia's residence before his disappearance. They allegedly found 
evidence, to link some RAM-HF officers to the killing. 84 The argument 
was made that the timing and brutality of the murders were meant to 
create an unstable situation favorable for a coup. Perhaps, it was the 
realization that their actions could be exploited by the ultra-right that 
radical labor unions and organizations desisted from prolonged massive 
demonstrations at the time. 

Barely a week and a half after the preempted 11 November plan, 
Military intelligence operatives discovered another coup plot, this time 

for 23 November and allegedly involving a RAM-Marcos loyalist 
a lance with the intention of simultaneously massing soldiers in Manila 



152 



to coincide with the convening of the old Batasang Pambansa. The plans 
were supposedly finalized at a meeting in the house of former Kilusang 
Bagong Lipunan (KBL) Assemblyman Antonio Carag, a known Marcos 
loyalist and Enrile ally, on early Saturday morning, 22 November in 
Wack-Wack Subdivision, Mandaluyong. The meeting was reportedly 
attended by Enrile, Honasan, Turingan, as well as Marcos supporters. 
Turingan was supposed to have called Ramos at his GHQ office to try to 
convince him to join them but Ramos refused. Turingan allegedly 
replied, "We will go it alone then." 86 

The plan called for seizing the Batasang Pambansa building in 
Quezon City, where former KBL assemblymen would convene the 
parliament that was abolished in March 1986 after the EDSA Revolt. 
They would then elect former Speaker Yniguez as acting President, 
nullify the 7 February "snap" presidential election, demand that President 
Aquino step down from office, and call for a new election, all in one sweep. 

In the initial rebel moves, it was said that Lt Col Aguinaldo and Col 
Hernani Figueroa(PMA'66) moved their forces south wardfrom Cagayan 
intending to link up with the other rebel troops in Manila. At Camp 
Aguinaldo, where a Board of Generals meeting was being held at noon 
on 22 November, CAPCOM Commander Montano reported on some 
unauthorized troop movements. He said around three trucks of soldiers 
were reportedly sighted along the North Diversion Road bound for 
Manila. There was also confirmed movement at the headquarters of 
Honasan located behind the MND building. 

With Honasan's forces at the MND compound were Kapunan, 
Turingan, Robles, Erfe, and LCdr Jaime Lucas (PMA'73), amongothers. 
They had between 100-200 men under them and were backed up by 
armored vehicles, consisting of about ten Scorpion tanks, advanced 
infantry vehicles and I V-150s, which were garaged behind the MND 
building. The RAM-HF officers were aboard three Toyota Land Cruisers 
in commando team formation. They were all heavily armed and had 
additional stockpiles of weapons (Ultimax, Galils,Armalites, etc.) inside 
the vehicles one of which was owned by Honasan's brother, Don. Most 
of the group belonged to the MND Security Unit of Enrile, as well as the 
Special Anti-Terrorist Battalion.

they had on several occasions invited the men of the 15 SW, which Sotelo 



CHAPTER IV 153 



commanded, to jog with them. Perhaps they saw the potential of air 
support in their future plans as there were only two combat units in the 
PAF. Among those in the jogging group of Honasan were Legaspi, 
Hotchkiss (now Commander of the 16th Tactical Squadron under the 15 
SW), Capt Elmer Amon (PMA '81 and also a T-28 pilot), and PAF Lt 
Gregor Mendel Pan elo (PMA '84), all helicopter pilots of Sotelo. 

The Special Anti-Terrorist Battalion was the result of Enrile's 
initiative in May 1986, to form an elite group from the units tasked to 
deal with hijacking (air, sea or land) and other terrorist activities. The 
battalion directly reported to Enrile as chairman of the National Action 
Committee on Anti-Hijacking (NACAH), and was headed by Honasan. 
It was composed of specially trained men in the AFP, including the 
Navy's Special Warfare Operations Group (SWAG), the Army's Special 
Forces Unit, elements of the Scout Rangers, the PC's Special Action 
Force (SAF), and others. 86 In fact, this accumulation of military talent 
in the MND had earlier alarmed several high-ranking officers, not only 
because it dissipated the AFFs elite forces, but also because of its 
suspicious concentration in one place. However, nothing was done about 
it until after November 1986. 

In the afternoon of 22 November, Ramos instructed Mison to monitor 

the moves of KBL politicians. Mison, therefore, sent surveillance teams 

to the homes of Yniguez, Jose Rono, and Vicente Magsaysay. Yniguez 

and Rono both denied any knowledge of the plan when Mison called 

them. Ramos tried to contact Enrile or Honasan in the late afternoon, 

but to no avail. Commo Virgilio Marcelo (PMA '61), then a Navy Capt 

and Commander of GHQ Headquarters Service Command at Camp 

Aguinaldo, was tasked with preventing the troops of Honasan from 

leaving the camp at all costs. On the other hand, BGen Javier Carbonell's 

brigade was given the responsibility of blocking the only road from the 

MND out of the camp. Carbonell, who rose from the reserve ranks, was 

ported to have hurled the challenge: "The fight will start and finish 
there." 



By 7:00 p.m., Marcelo had sent a reinforced company to block Gate 
of the camp (all other gates had been sealed earlier). The composite 
or ces under Mison were monitoring the rebels' armor in coordination 
Marcelo's group. Meanwhile, Ramos had conferred with the 
commanders of the major services, and by 8:00 p.m., all government 
°rces in the three military camps (Camps Crame and Aguinaldo, and 
0rt Bon ifacio) were on full red alert and just waiting for instructions. 



154 



At 9:00 p.m., Ramos called PC Maj Efren Arayata, head of the 
Guardians Brotherhood, Inc (GBI), a military organization which claims 
membership of about 70 percent of the total AFP strength. It will be 
recalled that alleged Guardian members also participated in the Manila 
Hotel Incident of July 1986. Ramos wanted to ascertain the GBI 
leadership's loyalty, recalling that many of its members had been 
recruited for the two previous coup attempts. Arayata reassured Ramos 
of support. That same night, Ramos sent a message to all military field 
commanders nationwide to inform them of the situation. He also 
instructed them to "prepare for any eventuality" and to disregard all 
orders emanating from the MND, particularly Honasan's. 87 Shortly 
after midnight, soldiers were sent to guard all vital installations 
(communications centers, water and electric stations, government 
buildings). The troops guarding the Batasan complex were beefed up to 
three battalions. 

Also at around midnight on 22 November, Ramos called the RAM- 
HF officers to a conference, but it was only Turingan and some junior 
officers who attended. Ramos asked Turingan to locate* Honasan but 
Turingan said he could not do so because Honasan was still "with his 
troops". 88 Ramos then sent an unequivocal message to the RAM officers: 
they could leave the camp but would have to face the consequences. They 
were also warned not to attempt to use the parade grounds as a landing 
field because there wouldbe orders to shoot them. Eventually, Honasan's 
group backed down, probably realizing that they were completely boxed 
in. At about 3:00 a.m., 23 November, they began going back to barracks. 

Canieso, who was then CG PA, revealed to the Commission in June 
1990 that the intelligence briefings they had received in November 1986 
mentioned several other units as being involved in the de stabilization 
plot now known as "God Save The Queen". These units were the Scout 
Ranger Companies attached to the MND and to the PSG, the light 
Armor Companies attached to the Defense Ministry and to Malacafiang, 
the 16 IB under Malajacan, the 49 IB led by Aromin, and the 42 IB with 
many junior officers and soldiers formerly with the MND Security 
Group. 

Canieso also disclosed that there were indeed some planned 
maneuveringsby some of these units but they were dealt with effectively. 
In the case of the 49 IB, Aromin moved three-fourths of his battalion 
(about 300 men) to Manila from Quezon province. Canieso sent a 
superior officer to meet the troops along the way and to direct them to 
Fort Bonifacio to a "reserved quartering area" where they could be 
controlled. Canieso then sent for Aromin to tell him that he only had two 



CHAPTER IV 155 



options. One wks to follow Canieso's orders as his CG and the other was 
to disobey them. Canieso said he was giving Aromin a few minutes to 
think about it. If Aromin chose the second, Canieso would arrest him 
immediately for mutiny. But if he opted for the first, then Canieso was 
going to allow Aromin to report back to his men and they would be 
authorized to return to the Bondoc Peninsula. Aromin chose to obey 
Canieso's orders. 89 

In the cases of Malajacan's troops from the 16 IB and some elements 
of the 42 IB, when reports were received that they were preparing to 
leave their areas of operation to come to Manila, the Army Chief sent 
them urgent messages to stay put despite whatever plans they had, and 
to await orders only from him. The troops were, thus, prevented from 
moving out. In effect, the coup became a chess game with each side trying 
to anticipate and block the moves of the other. In the end, the rebels 
backed down without firing a shot. Thus, the majority of the civilian 
population was never really aware of all of the activities until the 
incident, which a retired general termed as a "non-event", was over. 
President Aquino herself was not provided all the details by Gen Ramos, 
even as he took all remedial measures to contain it. 90 

On 23 November, Sunday, at 2:00 p.m., President Aquino briefly met 
with Enrile in her Malacaflang office where she asked for his resignation 
and then immediately appointed Deputy Minister Ileto to replace him. 
She further asked the rest of her Cabinet ministers to resign in order to 
"give the government a chance to start all over again." Then, the 
President went on nationwide radio and television broadcast to announce 
her decision. She also gave government peace negotiators only until the 
end of November to produce a ceasefire agreement or terminate all 
further talks with the National Democratic Front (NDF) [the NDF had 
called offthenegotiationsfollowingthe Olalia murder]. In her statement, 
President Aquino firmly added, "My circumspection has been viewed as 
weakness, and my sincere attempt at reconciliation as indecision. This 
cannot continue. I hereby give notice to all those who may be inclined to 
exploit the present situation that sterner measures will be taken against 
them if they try." 

Hours after the President announced her decisions on radio and 
television, RAM-HF soldiers surrounded the MND building, some even 
Positioned themselves on the roof. The men were in full battle gear. 
Newly-appointed Defense Minister Ileto hurriedly called for a closed- 
door conference of the four nmjor service commanders. Later, Ileto 
usued a statement that the Armed Forces were in full control of the 
situation. That same Sunday afternoon, the military released to the 



156 



media an AFP message sentby Ramos to all major commanders and field 
commanders, declaring that the plot to convene the defunct Batasang 
Pambansa, with the support of certain military factions, had been 
aborted without loss of life. Ramos said that the situation in Metro 
Manila was calm, with the President in full control of the government. 
In the same message, Ramos reiterated to the commanders the need for 
"maintenance of order, sobriety and stability in their respective areas, 
and to play down any alarm the report might generate." He also called 
on them to strengthen the chain of command from Commander-in-Chief 
down to the lowest unit. 91 

On Monday, 24 November, Press Secretary Teodoro Benigno 
confirmed that the newspaper expose on the coup had been true. He said 
some military forces outside Manila had planned to join former KBL 
assemblymen in the takeover of the Batasang Pambansa to reconvene a 
rebel parliament. However, he said, the plot had been uncovered and 
"checkmated" by government troops. On the other hand, that same day, 
Minister Ileto appeared vague if not evasive about the details of the 
attempt. He said: "This plotis still a rumor. We do nothave the evidence. 
We do not have the facts of the case." Asked about the fate of Honasan, 
Ileto replied, "It's too early for me to tell." However, Ileto mentioned that 
some of the plotters, most of whom were said to be members of Enrile's 
staff, had tendered their "courtesy resignations". He named Robles as 
one ofthose who resigned. Minister Ileto further stated that a preliminary 
investigation into the coup attempt was underway and that the results 
of an "informal investigation at intelligence level" would determine 
whether a full-dress investigation was warranted. 92 Ileto had been given 
a free hand in meting out punishment against the coup plotters by 
President Aquino. 

As testified in Executive Session, no formal investigation was ever 
made of the incident. On the other hand, Mison told the Commission in 
June 1990 that an investigation of the incident was ordered by Ramos 
but he was not aware of any charges filed against the coup plotters. He 
explained that Ramos's moves had always been conciliatory, not wanting 
to deepen the cleavages existing within the AFP. He said if the "iron fist" 
had been used, the military leadership was not sure about the sentiments 
and reactions of the troops in the field. 93 For his part, Ramos maintained 
that as CSAFP there was not much he could do inasmuch as the plotters 
were mostly under the jurisdiction of the MND and answerable to 
someone else. 94 

The group of Honasan remained at the MND for a while even after 
Ennle s resignation and during Ileto's initial tenure. They were later 



CHAPTER IV 157 



redeployed or given different assignments back to their branch of 
service. One of Ileto's first acts as Defense Minister was to return the 
armor andheavy weaponry as well as the military personnel accumulated 
at MND by his predecessor to their respective major service commands. 
Mison was assigned to formally carry this out. In the process, he 
discovered that a substantial number of firearms, radios, vehicles, and 
some ^2 million were unaccounted for. After a prolonged official 
inquiry, the AFP Anti-Graft Board ordered Honasan to account for the 
money which was supposed to have been spent for the purchase of 
equipment. His appearance before the Board was scheduled on 30 
August 1987, but this was overtaken by other events. 

In the aftermath of the announced Cabinet revamp, the various 
reactions of people and groups were both predictable and generally 
optimistic. Not much was really known about the details of the coup now 
referred to as "God Save The Queen" nor about how it was quashed at the 
time, but the majority of the people appeared relieved it was over. 
Government officials and even some opposition leaders welcomed the 
Cabinet revamp which they felt would give the administration a "fresh 
start". Perhaps as a compromise with rebels' demands of "cleansing" her 
Cabinet of "left-leaning" members, President Aquino subsequently 
removed Labor Minister Augusto Sanchez. For its part, the KBL, 
through its Secretary General Salvador Britanico, vehemently denied 
any participation in the coup plot. He claimed that the accusations 
against his party were all part of a disinformation campaign in the 
struggle between factions of the military. 95 Vice President Laurel said 
that the resignation of Enrile should not cause panic and worry as the 
AFP was in the hands of the "ablest military men" (referring to Ramos 
and Ileto). Cause-oriented groups and some leftist organizations were 
more cautious in their reactions. The NDF hailed Enrile's ouster but 
expressed fears about the government's policy towards the CPP/NPA 
because they claimed Ramos and Ileto were rabid supporters of the US, 
which has been behind the implementation of the comprehensive anti- 
insurgency scheme. 96 They predicted that the so-called "left-leaning" 
Cabinet ministers would be removed from the administration. 

The foreign reactions were likewise supportive and fairly opti- 
mistic. Australian Foreign Minister Bill Hayden said his government 
backed President Aquino. An Indonesian editorial said that the 
Resident's decision to sack Enrile would strengthen her government, 
while a Thai newspaper commenting on the same said, "It had to 
happen." The US reaffirmed its now familiar "strong and unequivocal 
support" for President Aquino. Congressman Stephen Solarz said 
Resident Aquino had "won the hearts and minds of the American people 



158 



when she came here in September." Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the 
US Senate Committee on the Armed Forces, commented, The Philippine 
military has to be reorganized. The military has to gain the confidence 
of the people."* 7 

A PMA graduate assigned to Central Luzon expressed what could 
possibly have been a dawning realization for many at that time: The 
heroes of February are now the villains of November.'' 

D. January 1987 GMA-7 Incident 

On Tuesday, 20 January, there were again reports of a possible coup 
attempt, this time to be launched over that weekend. The reports to the 
Army CG pointed to four groups that had an interest in seizing power. 
These were the Marcos loyalists; military men loyal to Enrile; members 
of the AFP who were disgusted by the security and counterinsurgency 
policies of the Aquino administration; and some big businessmen. 88 

One scenario of the plan supposedly involved the abduction or 
liquidation of the Army Chief, his staff and military commanders. This 
was meant to paralyze the operations of the Army and prevent its 
personnel from responding to the normal chain of command. The 
ultimate objective was to topple the government of President Aquino. 
However, the plan was disparaged by the Army CG himself, Canieso, 
saying it had little chance of succeeding. 

The political situation took a turn for the worse when, well into the 
60-day ceasefire agreement to hold peace negotiations between the 
government and the CPP/NPA, hundreds of peasants demonstrating for 
land reform at Mendiola bridge near Malacanang were fired at by 
elements of the military and the police on 22 January. Many farmers 
were killed in what is now known as the "Mendiola Massacre", causing 
the NDF to suspend their participation in the peace talks and government 
negotiator Maris Diokno to resign from the panel. The ceasefire was 
scheduled to expire on 7 February, five days after the plebiscite on the 
Constitution. 

On 24 January, an alleged coup plot was uncovered by the military 
before it was put into operation. The plotters were said to be a dis- 
gruntled faction of the Armed Forces, Marcos loyalists, and some right- 
wing politicians. The attempt was supposedly held off, at least 
temporarily, when Ramos called for and met behind closed doors the 
alleged military leaders of the plot led by Honasan and Kapunan. 88 



CHAPTER IV 159 



Three days later, a group of Marcos loyalists, many of whom were 
members of the GBI, attempted to take over military camps and a TV 
station with the intention of reinstating Marcos into office before the new 
Constitution was ratified. There were at least four target areas that the 
rebels were apparently going to hit, judging from their staging points: 
VAB, Sangley Point Air Base, Fort Bonifacio, and GMA-7 television 
station. On their way to reinforce the other rebel troops, a group of 
soldiers numbering a little over a hundred, coming from the Philippine 
Army Training Command (PA TRACOM) in Fort Magsaysay, Nueva 
Ecija and Regional Command (RECOM) 3, were intercepted and 
apprehended by elements of the CAPCOM led by Col Reynaldo Dino at 
the North Expressway by the Balintawak Toll Gate, as they were 
entering Metro Manila at 1:30 a.m. on 27 January. The fully -armed 
military personnel, mostly Guardians, were headed by Capt Nemencio 
Carvqjal, although their orders had come from Cabauatan, as was 
revealed by later sworn testimonies. 100 

As early as December 1986, Maj Romeo Daclan, a GBI member, had 
been reportedly seen at Fort Magsaysay recruiting other Guardians to 
join him in a destabilizing action. He was said to have met with Carvajal 
and Maj Pedrito Magsino at the PA TRACOM. On 26 January, GBI 
leaders from Fort Magsaysay were met by PC Maj Manuel Divina (PMA 
73) and his brother, Lt Edgardo Divina (PMA 77) in San Fernando, 
Pampanga regarding a planned disruption of the plebiscite on the 
Constitution scheduled for 2 February. 

On the other hand, the movement at VAB appears to have been 
connected with the meeting of about 20 PAF officers at Kowloon 
Restaurant in Makati on the evening of 20 January. The meeting was 
reportedly presided over by Lt Col Rodolfo Calzado, despite the presence 
ofamore senior officer, Col Romeo Javelosa. The same group supposedly 
metagain in a private home in Quezon City on 26 J anuary , this time with 
*e presence of Col Bertuldo de la Cruz, Capt Nonito Calizo, and some 
enlisted men. 

After the meeting, Calizo accompanied by Sgt Samuel Nagac went 

to the PAF Security Group in Porac and then to Bacolor, Pampanga to 

allegedly recruit more Air Force men through the GBI network for their 

Planned activity. A group of about ten of them then headed back for 

Manila but due to mechanical problems, they did not arrive at VAB until 
u '30 p.m. 

Prom the meeting in Quezon City, de la Cruz went to another one 
at the h °use of Dr Arturo Tolentino, Jr, where he briefed PC Maj 



160 



Francisco Ovilla and 21 others, after which he gave them an sarmalite 
each and a substantial amount of ammunition. From there, the military 
men went to VAB on board a Toyota car, a jeep, and a rented coaster. 
Joined by another group of 41 soldiers along the way, they proceeded to 
VAB in front of the 205th Helicopter Wing (205 HW) headquarters. 

In the meantime, at 9:15 p.m. inside VAB, intelligence reports were 
received that a group of loyalists were planning to attack the armory and 
communications facilities of the base that night or the next day. After 
an emergency meeting of all VAB commanders at the PAF chiefs 
quarters, the interior guard of the 205 HW was doubled, security of the 
armory was beefed up, and all Wing staff and unit commanders were 
instructed to take precautionary measures. At 1:45 a.m., 27 January, 
while Col Loven Abadia (PMA '60), Wing Commander, 205 HW, was 
briefing his men about the current situation in the aircraft parking area, 
a convoy of vehicles loaded with armed men arrived. This was presumably 
the group of de la Cruz. Refusing to identify themselves to Lt Col Dante 
Bernabe who had been sent to question them, the armed soldiers 
dispersed and deployed at the far side of the road facing the 205 HW 
headquarters, while the personnel of the 205 HW took up defensive 
positions. Loven Abadia then went into the headquarters building 
where he called up the PAF chief and the Wing Commander of the 520th 
Air Base Wing (520 ABW) to report the presence of the armed men, who 
were later identified as the "Blue Thunder Commandos". 101 

For his part, Calizo andhis ten recruits joined another group of about 
50 soldiers aboard an M35 cargo truck which dropped them at the Air 
Material Wing Savings and Loan (AMWSL) area in the early morning of 
27 January, while the others got off at different points around VAB. 
After a short briefing, Calizo's men divided into groups of three and 
headed towards the 520 ABW. 

Meanwhile, an exchange of automatic fire ensued between the 
commandos led by de la Cruz, and personnel of the 205 HW backed up 
by other Air Force units at 2:30 a.m. Shortly after, the rebels boarded 
their vehicles and tried to make their way towards the Baclaran gate 
(Gate 1) of VAB. However, the road was blocked by government troops 
positioned in front of the 520 ABW. Another exchange of gunfire 
followed, during which de la Cruz was wounded. 

Calizo was also hit on the leg when firing erupted at 3:30 a.m. from 
the direction of the PAF Security Command (PAFSECOM) tower towards 
where he and his men were holed out. He ordered his men not to return 
fire but to call an ambulance instead. When the ambulance arrived, he

and his men surrendered to the Air Provost Marshal. Calizo later 
admitted having left Pampanga With his men to meet up with other 
troops at VAB in order to take over the Wing Operations Center (WOC) 
of the 520 ABW and to control the aircraft parking area. The men cited 
varying reasons for having joined the mutiny, ranging from wanting a 
stronger government policy against communism, having long pent-up 
grievances against the assignment and promotion policies of the PAF, to 
feeling discriminated against because they were loyal to former President 
Marcos. 

By 5:30 a.m., the commandos realized they were outnumbered and 
had no chance with daylight breaking, so they surrendered one by one. 
Loven Abadia approached de la Cruz, the leader of the commandos, to 
ask him to surrender and turn in his gun, but the latter arrogantly 
refused. He only agreed when Abadia fired a warning shot. Altogether, 
there were 68 members of the commandos who surrendered, 16 of whom 
were wounded. There was only one killed, rebel soldier Pfc Daniel 
Hubag. 



Thus armed, the officers and soldiers went towards the 15 SW 
^quarters, joined by two other officers, Capt Rodolfo Jequinto and Lt 
"illamor Lazo. The guards at the main gate of the headquarters were

armory were given simultaneously to their men by rebel officers Lt Col

Sam, and TSgt Celestino Fran purportedly because of the "red alert" 
status at the time. Recruits among enlisted men from the nearby Naval 
Support Command in Fort San Felipe, Cavite City, were also given 
firearms by P03 Vicente Anog, Jr, who had earlier told the men they

house in Cavite City, then later to a less accessible house in a barrio 
in General Trias, Cavite. 

By 2:00 a.m., the rebels had overrun the WOC of the 15 SW, taking 
Col deDios, Director of Operations, into custody. Bayan, the acknowledged 
leader of the group, controlled the communications at the WOC Ijy 
ordering the removal of the mouthpieces from the telephones, except the 
one beside him. He also ordered the commercial radio frequency to be 
changed to 10.8. At one point, he told de Dios, "It is the day of the return 
of Marcos and we are protecting the government from communism."* 03 

Seven hours later, realizing the futility of the siege, Bayan and the 
rest of the rebels at Sangley Air Base agreed to lay down their firearms. 
Negotiations were facilitated by PAF officers Col de Dios, Lt Col Baquir, 
Hotchkiss, and Capt Ortizo. At 10:00 a.m., through negotiations between 
PAF chief Sotelo and Bayan, Galacgac was sent to fetch Maligat and 
Pitpitan, earlier held hostage by the rebels in (Jen Trias, Cavite. The 
other rebel officers who surrendered were Capts Manuel Rodis, J equinto, 
and Danilo Galvez, and Lt Leodecario Aspan. At 2:30 p.m. on 27 
January, the rebel officers from Sangley were airlifted to the VAB for a 
conference with the PAF commanding general. 

At Fort Bonifacio, a group of soldiers and some civilians belonging to 
the GBI assembled at the quarters of Daclan on 26 January, starting 
from around 9:00 in the evening. Lt Rogelio Buendia and five Marine 
enlisted men went there and were told by Daclan that they were going 
to undertake a purely Guardian action against communism. At 4:00 a.m. 
of 27 January, on the basis of a report that armed men were grouping 
there, Daclan's house was raided by combined elements of the Scout 
Rangers, 202nd Military Police (MP) Company, Light Armor Brigade, 
and some other units. Daclan, Buendia along with 11 Army soldiers, five 
marines, one patrolman, and 21 civilians were rounded up and brought 
to the 202 MP Company headquarters for interrogation. 

Most of those apprehended said that they were at Daclan's quarters 
to attend a prayer meeting led by Buendia. However, they were all 
heavily armed when arrested. Seized from them were three M14 rifles, 
16 armalite rifles, one M60 LMG cal 7.62 with spare barrel, one smoke 
grenade, a radio set with two handsets, and numerous ammunition. 
Subsequently, one of the soldiers revealed that Daclan had told him and 
the others that 28 chapters of the GBI would stage a revolution against 
the communists. 



CHAPTER IV 163 



The occupation of GMA-7 appeared to be better planned compared 
to the other incidents. At 1:30 a.m. on 27 January, PAF Special Reaction 
Group (SRG) elements from the RPN-9 transmitter and La Mesa Dam 
areas entered the GMA-7 compound purportedly to augment the security 
detail there. The group was led by Maj Ruben Sagmit and Lt Zaragoza, 
assisted from the inside by A1C Romantico. The rebels took the firearms 
from the SRG arm rack of GMA-7 and distributed them to the members 
of the group. In the meantime, Sagmit told Maj Pastor Razon, CO SRG 
unit assigned to the TV station, that a coup d'etat was taking place. 

The 43 employees and visitors of GMA-7, who were around at the 
time, were directed to gather at the Talent Room and were prevented 
from leaving by rebel soldiers. At 2:20 a.m., three truckloads of heavily 
armed military personnel led by Maj Divina arrived to reinforce the 
rebels atthe GMA-7. Shortly after, Col Hernando Lopez (PMA'66), SRG 
chief, who had been contacted by his men, arrived at the GMA-7 
compound. He was supposedly told by Sagmit and Divina that they 
had launched a coup because they did not like the way the government 
was treating the military. To further convince him of the rebel cause, 
Abadilla spoke with Lopez by telephone for some 20 minutes. Abadilla 
allegedly told Lopez that PAF Col Oscar Canlas (PMA '63) would soon 
arrive at the station and that Lopez should not put up any resistance. 106 

At 5:00 a.m., Canlas arrived at GMA-7 with some 100 men to join the 
rebels there. At about the satne time, a group of 100 civilians claiming 
to be Marcos loyalists also entered GMA-7. Lopez requested Canlas to 
allow the former to pull outhismen, their firearms, and belongings. The 
petition was granted by the rebel officer and carried out an hour later, 
after Lopez and his men failed to convince the rebels to give up. 

Meanwhile, the government was in a dilemma as to how to resolve 
the crisis without bloodshed or extensive damage to property. The other 
four incidents had ended without great losses, except for the death of a 
«bel soldier and the wounding of some others. The siege at GMA-7, 
however, was taking longer to end, while in the meantime, it was 
receiving ample media coverage both here and abroad, a factor damaging 
to the country's image. There was also a growing number of civilians 
rallying to the rebels' side, most notable of whom were movie stars 
%re,Oropeza, Ferrer, and"Amay Bisaya". By 12:30 p.m., 27 January, 
. ^re civilians had managed to enter the GMA-7 compound by passing 
wer the fence, despite the military's having cordoned off the area. 

At 4:00 a.m., 28 January, Gen Ramos sternly ordered Canlas and his 
followers to vacate the premises of the TV station but the rebels refused. 



164 



Instead, Canlas wrote a letter addressed to the Filipino people explaining 
the reasons why they took over GMA-7. Their basic intentions were 
supposedly to make people aware of the growing menace of communism, 
to protest against what they perceived was the "communists' access to 
sensitive government positions", and to decry what they saw as the 
uneven application of justice amongmembers of the military organization, 
They called on President Aquino to step down from the presidency and 
for Marcos to be restored as Chief Executive because for them "only he 
could solve the country's problems." 106 Marcos and his family allegedly 
made an attempt to return stealthily into the country from their exile in 
Hawaii to coincide with the coup attempt, but were prevented from doing 
so by the US government. 

As the second day of the siege ended, the military had begun to 
examine more drastic options to resolve the problem. Ramos was in a 
house next door to GMA-7 and they were thinking of digging a tunnel 
underground so that crack troops could get into the station and launch 
a surprise attack. 107 It was on the evening of 28 January that a group of 
PMA officers led by Honasan met with Ramos to present a "plea" to stop 
the planned assault by CAPCOM troopers on the rebels, arguing that 
any drastic action would merely divide the AFP. 108 

The PMA officers, mostly belonging to Classes 1965 to 1983, made 
the following petitions: 

1. A major reform and overhaul of the AFP and a hard line 
communist stand; 

2. The terms of military officers having reached retirement age 
should not be extended; 

3. All soldiers, including supporters of former President Marcos, 
should receive equal treatment; 

4. Civilian supporters of the rebel troops should be allowed to 
leave the Channel 7 building; and 

5. There must be a guarantee that no force would be used against 
the rebels. 

After a long series of negotiations, the rebels finally agreed to lay 
down their arms. By 9:00 a.m., 29 January, the civilian rebel supporters 
left GMA-7 and were brought to Camp Karingal in Quezon City where 
records-processing was done. Seven hours afterwards, the military 



CHAPTER IV 165 



personnel under Canlas were escorted out of the TV station and brought 
to Fort Bonifacio by BGen Rodolfo Biazon (PMA '61). The siege was over 
after 64 172 hours (almost three days). On 30 January, Ramos ordered 
thearrest of Zumel, Abadilla, Cabauatan, and Baquiran for their alleged 
involvement in the rebellion. 109 Charges were filed both in military as 
well as civilian courts against those who participated in the coup 
attempt. Some were acquitted, some had their cases dismissed, some 
stillhave their cases pending, while others are already serving sentences. 

In subsequent inquiries and assessments after the coup attempt, it 
was found that rebel soldiers had sabotaged the transmitter facility of 
the government television station (PTV-4) before taking control of 
GMA-7. They had also destroyed some transmission lines of RPN-9, 
preventing it from broadcasting for a time. The lines were restored by 
aboutnoontime of 27 January, and the station was able to go back on the 
air. GMA-7 was estimated to have lost about 1*3 million in the three days 
thatitwasnot able to broadcast. Electronic equipment from the studios, 
personal valuables, and cash from the offices were found missing after 
the rebels had left. The GMA-7 canteen lostl^OOO when it was 
ransacked. Thirty-five people, mostly civilians, were reported to have 
been wounded during the GMA-7 incident. 110 

It was said that the rebels, at some point, also tried to take Camp 
Aguinaldo, the MND building, and Fort Bonifacio, but were repulsed by 
government troops. This could be connected with the report that the 
Special Anti-Terrorist Battalion, the same one attached to the MND 
during the November 1986 coup attempt, had been observed making 
some movements. There reportedly had been military men in formation 
in front of the MND building, although not the size of a battalion. In his 
testimony before the Commission in June 1990, Mison admitted that the 
unit had remained surprisingly intact by 27 January 1987, despite 
previous attempts to dismantle it and the fact that Honasan was no 
longer at MND. 

0n21January 1987, perhaps in anticipation of future coup attempts, 
Defense Minister Ileto created an AFP Board of Officers headed by the 
Inspector General, BGen Hermogenes Peralta, Jr (PMA '59), tasked to 
investigate destabilizing activities against the government. Just six 
%s after its establishment, the Board had its first coup to investigate, 
^ong some of its findings in relation to the 27 January 1987 coup 
attempt were the following: 

Most of the Guardians and prominent personalities (military 
and civilian) who had participated in the 6 July 1986-Manila 



166 



Hotel incident were also involved in the 27 January 1987 coup 
attempt. 111 

2. There definitely had been support given to the military coup 
plotters from the civilian sector, mostly in the form of food, 
refreshments, use of homes and vehicles, and other resources, 
In at least one residential compound in Little Baguio, San Juan, 
for example, food and refreshments had been prepared for those 
who participated in the GMA-7 incident 

3. The leaders of the GMA-7 incident were identified to have been 
Col Rolando Abadilla PC (he was subsequently acquitted), Col 
Oscar Canlas PAF, Maj Ruben Sagmit PA, and Maj Manuel 
Divina PC. 

As a direct response by the executive branch of government to the 
coup, and to prevent its being caught by surprise again in the future, 
President Aquino created a Cabinet Crisis Committee on 28 January 
1987. Its task was "to attend to the matter of preventing a recurrence of 
the 27 January 1987 attempted coup and how to meet a similar situation, 
should it occur." 112 The Committee was composed of Dr Soriano as 
chairman, in his capacity as National Security Director; Ministers Jose 
Concepcion, Jr, Aquilino Pimentel, Jr, Alfredo Bengzon, and Vicente 
Paterno as members. The composition of the Committee altered when 
Pimentel and Paterno subsequently resigned to run for the Senate. 
Later, other government officials were also included. 

Still another response to the coup was the official designation of the 
National Capital Region Defense Command (NCRDC) about a week 
after the 27 January attempt. It was specifically assigned as the unit 
responsible for the security of Metro Manila amidst the destabilizing 
activities launched against the government. The NCRDC was not really 
a new unit. The counter-coup composite forces that make it up were 
organized right after the EDSA Revolt by then Vice Chief of Staff Lt Gen 
Mison, on orders of CSAFP Gen Ramos because "the situation was so 
unstable." The January 1987 coup simply formalized its existence, an 
act that perhaps could be interpreted as immense foresight, given the 
important role the NCRDC played in the defense of the governments 
succeeding coup attempts. 

The clearest response to the attempt of 27 January was the people's 
overwhelming ratification of the 1987 Constitution on 2 February. The 
new Charter confirmed the legitimacy of th e government an d emphasized 
the primacy of civilian authority over the military, a provision found in 



CHAPTER IV 167 



several of its sections. This should have sent an unmistakable message 
to the coup plotters that the people preferred to settle political questions 
through electoral processes, rather than through violence or civil 
disruption. However, the message seemed to have been lost on the coup 
plotters because within two months thereafter, they launched another 
coup attempt. 

E, April 1987 "Black Saturday* Incident 

Prior to the "Black Saturday Mutiny", as the 18 April coup attempt 
hasbeen called, the political situation was again volatile. The campaigns 
for congressional seats were just winding up in preparation for the first 
legislative polls since the fall of the dictator, scheduled for 11 May. 
Opposition candidates had been lambasting the Aquino administration 
for its alleged corruption and insincerity, for the breakdown in peace and 
order conditions, for the alarming power outage that hit all of Luzon, for 
the worsening water shortage problem due to the nationwide drought, 
for pegging the price of cement which had led to hoarding, and for just 
about every other problem that plagued the country at the time. 113 

However, some of the complaints did have their bases. Insurgency, 
for example, had escalated within Metro Manila and in the countryside. 
Some three weeks before the coup attempt in April, 200 communist 
guerrillas had brazenly raided two police stations and a PC detachment 
in PciJillo Island in Quezon province. Heavy military reinforcements 
were supposed to have been sent to the area but had been stalled because 
ofreported ambush plans for the military teams. 

On the same day that the coup attempt was launched, two bombs had 
exploded, one after the other, at the Colgate-Palmolive complex in 
Makati at 4:25 a.m., then at the Philippine Refining Company compound 
at4:45a.m. Nobody was injured in either blast although glass windows 
and lighting fixtures were destroyed in the first explosion. The police 
could not be sure if the bombs were related to the coup attempt at Fort 
Bonifacio, but it had been speculated that they could have been meant 
as some form of diversionary tactic. Just a month before, three bombs 
hadexploded at the PMA grandstand four days before President Aquino 
was scheduled to address the graduating cadets at that very stage. Four 
People were killed, while 43 were wounded by the explosion. AH these 
terroristic activities added to the people's feelings of political insecurity 
and confusion. 

The coup plot had been hatched in a series of meetings, mostly 
am ong enlisted personnel and Guardian members. Later investi- 



168 



gations revealed Cabauatan as the mastermind of the attempt. Early 
intelligence reports mentioned a meeting of Cabauatan's group on 4 
February 1987 at East Rembo, Fort Bonifacio (a subdivision where many 
enlisted men and their families live). The coup, which entailed a 
takeover of the Army headquarters, was to have been launched on 13 
March but did not push through due to lack of support. On 15 March, 
another meeting was reportedly held, this time at the residence of a 
former assemblyman at Greenhills, with Zumel, Mrs Romeo Daclan, 
Abadilla, Cabauatan, TSgt William Quitulvo, and ex-Cpl Nestor Bete in 
attendance, among others. Zumel and Abadilla had allegedly promised 
the plotters financial support. 114 

The coup plotters met again on 3 April at a house in Philamlife 
Homes, Quezon City, where Cabauatan allegedly gave out eleven M16 
rifles, three radio sets, countersign patches, 1*10,000 to Quitulvo, and 
=P500 each to former enlisted men, Bete and TSgt Ernesto Librado. A 
similar meeting was held at a coffee shop on Ortigas Avenue and EDSA 
where Cabauatan gave Librado seven M16 rifles and more money. Still 
at another meeting in Philamlife Homes on 14 April, the same people 
met with the addition of Nilo Tayag, Alona Alegre, and Cesar Zagala, 
all known Marcos supporters. 115 

Intelligence reports show that at a meeting in Quezon City on 16 
April, Cabauatan directed Librado and Bete to go to Quezon province 
and give P 20,000 to Majs Aromin and Jamcra. By then, the plotters 
had been discussing more drastic actions (e.g., bomb Malacanang) to 
pressure President Aquino to step down from office, restore Marcos to 
the presidency and create a military junta. 116 

The attempt was launched on 18 April, Easter weekend. At around 
4:00 p.m., Librado led a group of 13 enlisted personnel aboard a jeep 
owned by Daclan and a yellow six-wheeler truck to ram through Gate 1 
of Fort Bonifacio. Shooting wildly, they drove straight to the 202 MP Coy 
stockade where, assisted by eight MP soldiers from inside, they released 
the 108 military men detained there, most of whom participated in the 
27 January coup attempt. However, only 42 of the 108 men joined them. 
In the meantime, the gate guards had alerted the Army Operations 
Center (AOC), which then ordered the closing of all entries to Fort 
Bonifacio and the augmentation of guards at all gates. 

At about 5:00 p.m., the rebels proceeded to the Provost Marshal's 
headquarters where they raided the armory, then went on to the 
.Headquarters Philippine Army (HPA) building where they converted 
the office of the army chief of staff to their command post. Meanwhile, 



CHAPTER IV 169 



Bete and his group, who had previously been given other instructions, 
decided to join the rest of the mutineers at the HPA, bringing with them 
civilian and military passengers of the 12 cars they had intercepted 
along the way, as their hostages. 

At 7:00 a.m., there was an exchange of gunfire between the rebels 
and the government security forces deployed around the HPA. Camp 
authorities had arranged to selectively deactivate telephone lines to 
prevent the rebels from calling for reinforcements. In other parts of the 
city, security had been beefed up at Malacanang and the other military 
camps, while the roads to Manila were supposedly secured to stop any 
possible reinforcements of rebel troops coming from the provinces. 
Ramoslater said that the mutineers apparently had not intended to hold 
out in the camp and were forced to do so only upon realizing that all exits 
had been closed and were heavily guarded. 117 

At 7:30 a.m., a telephone negotiation with the acknowledged leader 
ofthe group, Librado, was conducted while government forces tightened 
the security ring around the HPA building. An eyewitness photographer 
recalled that at least four Scorpion light tanks, several armored cars, and 
jeeps mounted with machine guns surrounded the building. 118 

At 10:00 a.m., the mutineers fired at the government forces from the 
second floor where they had by then retreated to. Half an hour later, the 
government troops had entered the HPA building and secured the first 
floor. At 1 1:00 a.m., another telephone negotiation went on for the rebels 
to surrender, which they didhalf an hour later. The rebels admitted that 
they gave up after they realized they were "outnumbered and outgunned". 
One said they surrendered after a light tank fired a shell at the building 
as a prelude to an attack. 119 By 12:15, the HPA building had been 
completely cleared ofthe rebels, following President Aquino's earlier 
directive to Ramos and Canieso "to resolve the problem before noon". 

Ofthe 56 mutineers estimated to have participated in the "Black 
Saturday Incident" (also known as the "Enlisted Men's Revolt"), there 
were 45 who surrendered, 10 escaped, and one died. Some of the 
^tineers had white armbands with the initials "NAP" printed on them, 
Presumably signifying "Nationalist Armed Forces ofthe Philippines," 
^organization allegedly created by Cabauatan with anti-communist 
m *' Others, like Librado, had black triangular tattoos on their upper 
jnns with the words "Guardians Revolt". Librado was a "dishonorably 
ischarged" member of the Marcos security forces who allegedly had 
en missing since February 1986. He was said to be a member of the 



170 



Guardians Centre Foundation, Inc (GCFI), a splinter group of the GBI, 
founded by Honasan. 

Military interrogators had quoted some of the rebel surrenderees as 
admitting that the assault at Fort Bonifacio had been "part of a bigger 
plot to topple the Aquino government. This included the attempt to take 
over the International School in Makati and hold children of foreign 
diplomats enrolled at the school as hostages and the takeover of media 
establishments and vital public utilities." 120 It was also discovered that 
most of the mutineers were former members of the military and came 
from Nueva Ecija. From among those detained at the MP Stockade who 
had joined the mutineers, it was found out that they were former men of 
Cabauatan, who had been part of that rebel force intercepted at the 
Balintawak Toll Gate during the 27 January 1987 coup attempt. 

The rebels allegedly had similar grievances and demands as those 
articulated in the past coup attempts: that President Aquino's approach 
towards insurgency was too "soft"; that she should sack the alleged 
"leftists" in her Cabinet; that the communists were winning because the 
President was weak; and that the present Cabinet set-up was corrupt 
and inefficient. 121 In a telephone interview with DZRH at the time of the 
siege, a leader of the mutineers who had identified himself only as "Col 
Avila" asserted: "Our demand is to let the people from Malacanang turn 
over the country to the military for the time being." He had also said, "We 
are going to fight to the last drop of our blood. We hope this is going to 
be the last revolt." 122 

In the after-coup assessment, it was found that there was only one 
casualty, a mutineer, ex-Sgt Toto de Guzman, while seven had been 
wounded (three rebels and four civilians). Not much had been materially 
damaged except for the gate that the rebels had destroyed to enter Fort 
Bonifacio, and the HPA building that had been left pockmarked with 
bullets. The damage was more perhaps on the image of the country faced 
with these obviously recurring coup threats. Although the attempt to 
destabilize the government on 18 April, a few weeks before the elections, 
had failed miserably, questions were raised about the administration's 
ability to survive more attempts in the future. Consequently, however, 
the government appeared to have been strengthened somehow by the 
attempt as was evidenced by the electoral exercise. Not even the claims 
of "mass fraud" by the opposition party, Grand Alliance for Democracy 
(GAD), after the polls could throw doubt on the legitimacy of the elections 
and of President Aquino's administration. Two cornerstones of democracy 
had been laid — the Constitution and Congress. 



CHAPTER IV 171 



After undergoing court-martial, the 41 non-commissioned officers 
who participated in the "Black Saturday" incident were acquitted. For 
his part, Cabauatan was sentenced to 12 years and one day imprisonment 
at hard labor, similar to the sentence given some of those in the GMA- 
7 coup attempt. 

On 15 June 1987, after five months of investigations, the AFP Board 
of Officers headed by the Inspector General came up with its conclusions 
regarding the January as well as the April 1987 coup attempts. 123 Some 
of the findings on the Black Saturday incident include the following: 

1. The participation of the Guardians surfaced in both coup attempts 
(i.e. , many of those investigated, detained or facing charges were 
identified with or admitted Guardian membership). 

2. Failure of the intelligence community to follow up leads (e.g., 
previous meetings held, etc.) which could have nipped in the bud 
such activities. 

3. The groups identified as being involved in coup attempts, 
particularly the Guardians, have become so pervasive and 
influential that some officers have joined these groups in order 
to have some leverage over their own subordinates, thereby 
obviously relegating their positions as military commanders 
behind those of their positions as members of the fraternity. 

4. Interviews with those implicated in the coups reveal that their 
sentiments favored Marcos, Ver or Enrile. Also, many viewed 
the proliferation of fraternal associations within the AFP as 
military men taking it upon themselves to bring about better 
treatmentforthemselves, since theyfeltthatnotenou^i attention 
is being given them. Others felt that they are neglected, treated 
badly or ostracized for being Marcos loyalists. 

5. In the 18 April 1987 attempt, although the plotters conducted 
their various meetings at the residences of civilians, the Board 
supposedly could find no other evidence to warrant the civilians' 
prosecution before the appropriate court. 

6 - Substantial funds had been provided to the participants of the 
27 January as well as the 18 April 1987 attempts. 



172 



The Board's recommendations included the following: 

1. Dismantling of all fraternal organizations within the AFP, 
except those authorized by law; 

2. Assignment of "stigmatized" officers and enlisted personnel to 
positions commensurate to their skills, training, experience, and 
overall potential; 

3. Vigorous and sustained indoctrination and reorientation; and 

4. The intelligence community should closely follow up leads related 
to destabilizing efforts. 

F. July 1987 MIA Takeover Plot 

The most obscure of the attempts at military intervention is the one 
that was exposed in the press in July 1987 probably because, like the 
"God Save The Queen" plot in November 1986, it was a "non-event" — 
meaning, it had been discovered before it could be launched. 

As far as the limited information available reveals, there seemed to 
have been two separate plots to overthrow President Aquino's government 
in July. One was publicly exposed by then Presidential Commission on 
Good Government (PCGG) Chairman Ramon Diaz at a press conference 
on 9 July. He used as evidence the taped conversation of former 
President Marcos with Robert Chastain, a French businessman, and 
American attorney Richard Hirschfeld, a former Marcos lawyer. The 
two were supposedly acting as middle-men in the sale of arms to Marcos. 
The three-hour conversation took place at Marcos's beach side residence- 
in-exile in Hawaii on 27 May and was secretly recorded by Hirschfeld. 
Diaz, however, claimed that three tapes of the conversation were 
furnished to him only in June duringhis trip to the US. He, in turn, gave 
copies of the tapes to President Aquino on 12 June during the 
Independence Day reception at Malacafiang. 

The taped conversation revealed that Marcos wanted to buy "from a 
European country" some 1,000 Armalite rifles, ammunition good for 
three months, 90 mm recoilless rifles, 100 .50 cal machine guns, 100 
grenade launchers, armored personnel carriers, Stinger air-to-ground 
and ground-to-air missiles, laser-sighting tanks, Blowpipe anti-tank 
equipment, helicopter gunships, and other weapons. He was planning 
to launch an invasion on the Philippines to be staged from Tonga, where 
the King was his personal friend and had offered him his island in the 



CHAPTER IV 173 



South Pacific. However, he would be using Hongkong as the trans- 
shipment point for the arms to be used in the operations, originally 
scheduled for end of June, but was supposedly changed to mid-July, for 
some reason, 124 

The purchase of weapons worth some $25 million was supposed to be 
financed by a loan from Saudi Arabian Prince Al-Fassi and repaid with 
gold Marcos claimed to have hidden in the Philippines. The plan was to 
land in northern Luzon, presumably in his home province, "and if they 
oppose the landing, . . . that's when we start the battles," declared Marcos 
in the tapes. Regarding what will happen to President Aquino, Marcos 
said they would "hold her hostage or, if necessary. . . Although left 
unsaid, assassination seemed to have been implied. 

What was interesting in this belatedly exposed invasion plot, besides 
its fanciful scenario, was its simultaneous revelation in Washington, DC 
before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific 
Affairs. On 9 July, the subcommittee heard the Marcos tapes along with 
the testimonies of Chastain and Hirschfeld, who disclosed that they had 
posed as middlemen in the deal to get Marcos the weaponry, and had 
taped the conversation allegedly on their own initiative after they had 
failed to get US Justice Department backing for the activity. 125 The 
evidence from the hearings and pressure from the US Congress had 
supposedly prompted the State Department to place Marcos under 
severe travel restrictions (i.e., barring him from leaving Oahu island 
where his beachhouse is located). 

In a written statement released to the press from Hawaii on 12 July, 
Marcos claimed that "The discussion in the tapes concerning arms and 
military action was premised on the prediction of the loss of the 
Philippines to a communist takeover or to a communist coalition with 
Mrs Aquino, and that the only hope of restoring freedom and democracy 
there would be a US-approved invasion which I would lead." 126 He did 
not, however, deny at any point the tape's contents. 

The highly incredible invasion plot and the rather bizarre circums- 
tances surrounding its revelation had induced most people to laugh it off 
or dismiss it as being just one more of those coup rumors. The military 
leadership downplayed the story. AFP spokesman then Col Honesto 
•sleta (PMA '58) said that they doubted the veracity of the story, 
^though they did not question the tapes' authenticity, they think 
Marcos knew he was being taped so "he was giving this message to boost 
*e sagging morale" of his supporters. 127 On the other hand, President 



174 



Aquino was "pleased" about the US warning to the ousted dictator 
against moves to topple her government. 

Barely a week after the Marcos tapes had been made public in 
Manila and in Washington, DC, news of another coup had leaked to the 
press on 13 July. This had followed the order to arrest at least 20 more 
military officers implicated in the new plot by an Army mcyor, who had 
been nabbed on 10 July and had supposedly confessed. The new coup 
plot was said to have been codenamed "Oplan Inang Bayan" and had 
consisted of two substage operations: Luisita I and Luisita II. The first 
allegedly involved an assault by helicopter gunships at the MIA and the 
holding of foreign hostages who would be used as shields against 
government troops. The second phase called for an attack on VAB also 
by helicopter gunships, aimed at disabling all military aircraft there. 
Then CAPCOM Chief BGen Alexander Aguirre said that the coup had 
the financial backing of a right-wing group of civilians and politicians 
who were said to be Marcos supporters. He added that the series of 
bombings in the last weeks prior to the discovery of the plot appeared to 
have been related to the coup bid. 

Newspaper accounts mentioned that the coup plotters supposedly 
consisted of two colonels, one on absent-without-official-leave (AWOL) 
status and the other still in active service; two majors in active service 
and holding sensitive posts at the time; two captains; six PAF officers; 
four Army officers; and a Marine officer. It was said that a former 
military officer who ran in the 11 May polls under the opposition party 
was also allegedly involved. Some of the officers were said to have been 
identified with Enrile, while the others, with Ramos. 128 

Reports revealed that the coup had been planned during several 
meetings in Makati. On 24 June, at 10:00 p.m., a meeting was said to 
have been held lasting until midnight, with the attendance of Abadilla; 
a Col Espejo;Majs Divina, Almario Hilario (PMA'73), Brillo, andRibaya. 
The agenda reportedly included the plan to occupy the MIA and VAB, 
and to establish a Council of State. 129 Another meeting was supposedly 
held on 2 July. 

Other bits of information included the plotters* having sought the 
assistance of the Guardians, who had reportedly promised to provide 
3,000 fully armed members, while a Marine officer pledged 400 of his 
men. Abigfood conglomerate was supposed to have promised to help the 
rebels by providing them with food during the execution of the coup. 130 



CHAPTER IV 175 



On 15 July, news reports came out regarding six unnamed military 
officers being questioned about the most recent coup plot. Defense 
Secretary Ileto, while confirming the interrogation, had said the officers 
under question "will not be arrested. Nor can they be liable to charges 
for their alleged participation in the plot." He added that while the 
supposed plotters might have considered staging a coup, nothing was 
actually done. "Anybody can sit down and drink beer and say a lot of 
things. But to actually accuse you is a different question." It would have 
been different if the plotters tried something like the attempt to capture 
Fort Bonifacio and their short-lived occupation of GMA-7, he further 
qualified. 131 



Although the coup plot had been admittedly "neutralized", the 
attitude of the military regarding additional information about it seemed 
confusing, if not contradictory. While acknowledging that there indeed 
hadbeen another coup plot, it tried to downplay its importance. And yet, 
speculations increased when the military leadership suddenly declared 
a news blackout by ordering all officers to withhold further information 
on the plot other than what had already been published in the press. Col 
Isleta said that this was because the military did not want to "jeopardize 
ongoing investigations on the plot." 132 However, no other information 
has ever been released on "Oplan Inang Bayan" since then. There is a 
case pending in the military court (People of the Philippines vs. Maj 
Manuel Divina, et al) regarding the MIA takeover attempt on 2 July 
1987, with four officers named as the principal coup participants. 133 
These four are Maj Manuel Divina, Maj Romeo Elefante, Capt Reynaldo 
Regacho, and Capt Christopher Mesias. Elefante was acquitted, while 
Kviiia, and Regacho have not been arraigned because they are still at- 
wge. Mesias was recently arrested. The July 1987 plot remains a 
perplexing incident in the line of past attempts at military intervention 
m the Philippines. 

& August 1987 Coup Attempt 

Weeks before the 28 August coup attempt, the political atmosphere 
again particularly tense and extremely uncertain. Labor unrest in 
e uties and the dim prospects for land reform in the countryside 
onunatedmany political debates, even as Congress formally opened on 
% There were talks of postponing the local elections originally 
eduled for November to sometime in January or February, upon 
commendation of the COMELEC (they were eventually held on 18 
January 1988) 



176 



Earlier, a spate ofbombings had rocked Manila, making the populace 
unusually jumpy. Tensions peaked on 14 August when the government 
announced an 80-centavo increase in oil prices. The widespread public 
outcry against the hike extended among the different sectors and social 
classes in society. Strikes and demonstrations were held all over the 
country, followed by the intermittent violent dispersals of protestors, 
which elicited even more public protests. Transportation and work 
stoppages were resorted to, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded in 
the streets, or work places abandoned. The militant labor unions and 
student organizations, who were at the forefront of the protests, had 
declared a nationwide Welgang Bayan starting from 2 6 August. Despite 
a price cutback ordered by the President on the eve of the 26th, the 
national strike successfully pushed through, paralyzing 11 cities. 

It is said that the RAM-HFs original launching date for the coup was 
29 August, but it was moved a day earlier to coincide with the culmination 
of the Welgang Bayan, when thousands of protestors were expected to be 
out in the streets. The plan of the rebels appeared to have been identical 
to the November 1986 "God Save The Queen" coup plot, with minor 
adjustments. Reportedly codenamed "A Star Will Fall, The Sun Will 
Rise," 134 the plan called for the takeover of Malacanang, key military 
installations, and radio and television stations in Metro Manila. With 
the occupations of the Palace and Camp Aguinaldo, which are the 
symbols of civil government and military authority, respectively, the 
coup plotters would have used the media stations to broadcast their 
propaganda in order to generate support from both the civilian and 
military sectors. The takeover of VAB and other airports, such as the one 
in Legaspi City, was expected to provide pick-up points for reinforcements 
from areas under their influence to be airlifted to Manila, the seat of 
government and therefore the principal battleground. By controlling 
these key installations for a period of time, the coup plotters expected 
military units as well as hordes of civilians to defect to their side. 

During the coup, there were at least eight areas of major conflict 
between the rebels and government forces, and numerous other areas 
of what could be considered as minor confrontation. The eight were 
Malacanang, Camp Aguinaldo, PTV-4/Camelot Hotel, Broadcast City, 
VAB, RECOM 3-Camp Olivas, RECOM 7-Cebu, and Legaspi Airport. In 
the one-and-a-half-day mutiny, the rebels were able to control, at least 
for a time, seven of the areas mentioned above, with the exception of 
Malacanang. 

A review of intelligence reports prior to the August coup shows that, 
like in many of the past attempts, there was not really a lack of 



chapter rv 177 



information, but perhaps more a deficiency in the follow-up of leads and 
potential sources of information, as well as the collation and evaluation 
of all such data. For example, on 10 July 1987, Honasan and a certain 
CPO Raquion were frequently monitored at Signal Village in Fort 
Bonifacio, while on 22 July, Nueva Ecija local officials reported that 
massive recruitment of police and military men by RAM-HF officers was 
taking place in their area purportedly for anti-insurgency operations. 
Regular meetings were supposedly being held to discuss perceived 
threats of a communist takeover, and yet these leads were not followed 
up. On 3 July, Lt Col Legaspi was said to have solicited Aromin' s support 
"in case the core group that triggered the February '86 revolution would 
again move to save the country from communists." When Aromin asked 
what his role would be in the effort, Legaspi allegedly told him he would 
inform him about it in the near future. Aromin and Legaspi were 
neighbors then in Fort Bonifacio. It must be remembered that Aromin 
was the CO of the 49 IB in February 1986 and one of those arrested and 
publicly presented by Marcos as having been involved in the RAM plot 
against him. His name surfaced again in November 1986 when he 
brought most of his men to Manila to participate in the "God Save The 
Queen" plot. 

Other intelligence reports included the supposed plan to liquidate 
the CSAFP and the PAF Chief by the groups of Hilario and Baula. The 
plan also included the takeover of VAB and the bombing of Malacanang. 
On 5 August, a report was received that some 2,000 troops would be led 

a provincial commander in RECOM 3 who would take over key 
government installations and selected media facilities in Metro Manila. 
The move was to have been followed by similar military actions in other 
key cities in the country. On 15 August, an open meeting was reported 
of officers formerly identified with Enrile and the defunct PSC-NISA. 
The meeting could have been considered a normal one except for the 
Presence of Lt Col Reynaldo Berroya PC (PMA '69) who had been 
previously reported to be meeting with different AFP units and the Chief 
« Staff, PSG. On 19 August, another intelligence report stated that key 
Personalities in the AFP were included as targets by disgruntled elements 
in the military in a coup attempt to be undertaken at a given signal. 135 
It was said that a military junta would be established composed mostly 
w young officers. More reports of an impending coup kept coming in. 

On 22 August, the PC Vice Chief of Staff called for an emergency 
eeting to verify the persistent reports reaching their headquarters 
ut plan to overthrow the government by way of assaults on 



iarig, military camps in Metro Manila and other parts of the 
oun try, and media stations. Civilian and military personalities were 



178 



said to have been earmarked for "neutralization." On the same day, red 
alert status was declared at VAB. The following day, the situation 
became even more tense when a telephone call received by some civilian 
employees of Camp Crame from their relatives who are soldiers warned 
them "not to stay out late at night", and that the critical period was 
anytime within the month. 136 On 27 August, reports were received about 
two separate meetings of plotters. One said that during a meeting at a 
restaurant in Timog Avenue, Quezon City, orders were given that the 
loyalists would move on 28 August at 2:00 a.m. Target areas would be 
Malacanang, military camps, media stations, and key government 
officials perceived to be "communists". It was said that simultaneous 
actions would be initiated in Cebu, Davao, and other provinces. The 
other meeting was supposedly at the Grand Atrium in Makati and talked 
about the Guardians launching an attack on all AFP installations. 
Although it is understandably difficult to verify and process the numerous 
bits of information received by the different intelligence units of the 
military, having the capability to do so and sharing this information with 
the civilian authorities would probably improve the government's 
security. 

As early as 20 August, key officers of the units that would be 
mobilized by the rebels for the coup appeared to have known their 
launching date. The 14 IB stationed in Palayan City, Nueva Ecija, under 
Lt Col Melchor Acosta, Jr (PMA 71) was alerted for action, using the 
scheduled visit of President Aquino to the RUC 3 as a cover. Company 
commanders Capt Danilo Baguio and 2Lt Rolando Cailing (PMA '85) 
were supposed to prepare for the security of the President during the 
visit, on orders allegedly received from the headquarters (HQ) of the 3 
Bde. On 23 August, in Camarines Sur, 16 IB company commander Lt 
Hernando Caraig, Jr (PMA '84) supposedly received information that 
something was going to happen in Manila. Thus, he and Maj Eufemio 
Santos prepared a troop movement plan the next day. On 25 August, 
Nueva Ecija PC Provincial Commander Eduardo Matillano placed his 
command on red alert, directed all his officers to prepare their strike 
forces to be on call within 24 hours for combat operation, and to bring 
provisions and clothing good for three days. 

On the morning of 27 August, 14 IB company commander Cailing 
called his three platoon leaders, Lt James Joven (PMA '84), 2Lt Alberto 
Gulmayo, and 2Lt Romulo Evangelista, for a meeting and gave them 
instructions to restrict their personnel to camp, prepare one week's 
provisions, and check firearms and ammunition for possible deployment 
anytime. Baguio did the same for his company. By 5:00 p.m., seven 



CHAPTER IV 179 



officers and 117 enlisted men of the 14 IB were ready to move out Acosta 
conducted a briefing of the troops. He told them their mission would no 
longer be to provide security for the Presidents visit, but instead would 
be to go to Manila to act as a "blocking force" at Ayala Bridge against a 
supposed impending attack on Malacanang, after which they would 
converge at Camp Aguinaldo. Their rendezvous point would be the Sta 
Rita toll gate on the North Expressway. 

Meanwhile, the Special Operations School (SOS) of the PATRACOM 
in Fort Magsay say, Nueva Ecija, was on a red alert w because of a scheduled 
visit of the CSAFP. The SOS then was under the command of Honasan, 
assisted by Maj Rodolfo Lazaro. It had a Scout Ranger (SR) department 
under it, headed by Capt Ernesto Lasco, with Capt Faustino Dantes as his 
assistant and Capt Roque Calagui, Jr as the administrative officer. At 
that time, the SOS was conducting SR training for three classes: SR Class 
#87-87 under Capt Dominador Lina, SR Class #88-87 under Lt Edmundo 
Malabanjot, and SR Class #89-87 under Capt Fidel Legiralde, as course 
directors. On 27 August, at around 10:00 p.m., the whole group of SR 
trainees with their officers left Nueva Ecija to link up with the other 
groups at the Sta Rita toll gate. Some of them were told they would be on 
a graded practical exercise and test mission, while others were simply 
ordered to board the trucks waiting for them. Lina pulled out 105 of his 
students on combat maneuver exercise in Pantabangan, Nueva Ecija to 
bring them directly to Camp Aguinaldo on the morning of 28 August. 

At the Regimental Training School (RTS) of the First Scout Ranger 
Regiment (FSRR) in San Miguel, Bulacan, the 94 new recruits attending 
an SR Orientation Course were ordered to board an M35 truck and were 
brought to the Sta Rita toll gate, passing by the junction of Tartaro and 
Maharlika Highway where some of the men transferred to a waiting 
Baliwag Transit bus. Lt Mario Antonio, OIC, 6th Company, FSRR, also 
based in San Miguel, mustered 14 of his men armed with three days' 
provisions, and headed for the rendezvous point. On the other hand, Capt 
Reynaldo Ordonez (PMA '78) and his men arrived at the Army detachment 
taSan Miguel, where they teamed up with the armor platoon of the 2 LAC 
fedby SSgt Abraham Valenton, and then went to join the convoy parked 
at the national highway of Bulacan with one APC and one V-150. combat 
vehicle. Valenton claimed that the Army detachment had received a 
radio message earlier from the 3 IB HQ to bring the V-150 to Camp 
%ino, Tarlac. It was later discovered that no such message had been 
Wand that it had been a ruse to get the armor out. 



M aj Abraham Purugganan (PMA 78), CO, 7th SR Company and 
ut 18 of his men had left Benito Soliven, Isabela on two Land Cruisers 



180 



at 11:00 a.m. on 27 August. They headed for San Miguel, Bulacan where 
they joined the batch of vehicles loaded with armed soldiers waiting 
along the highway. Purugganan's group later headed directly for Camp 
Aguinaldo where they secured the Communications-Electronics Service 
(COMMEL) area during the rebel's siege. i 

In the meantime, Lt Col Reynaldo Ochosa (PMA 72), CO 62 IB, met 
all of his officers on 27 August at 11:00 a.m. and instructed them to get 
the men ready for an "operation". His officers included Capt Daniel 
Mamaril, battalion operations officer; Maj Manuel Santos, battalion 
logistics officer; Lt Alfredo Manabat, CO "A" Coy; platoon leaders 2Lts 
Villamor Belmes, and Amando Escoto; Capt Felipe Muralla, CO u B n Coy; 
platoon leaders 2Lts Julian Mamuri, and Pablo Biglete; Capt Andres 
Fadrigalan, CO u C n Coy; Lt Francisco Atutubo, EX-0 "C" Coy; platoon 
leaders 2Lt Silver Linsangan and 2Lt Lazaro Alcoba; Capt Evaristo 
Bilog, CO HQ Svc Coy and his EX-O, Lt Edgardo Chua. Other officers 
who joined them were Capt Felipe Manlapaz and 2Lt Mario Capaycapay. 
Earlier, the men had already been alerted for a seven-day operation. 
Thus, fully armed and led by their officers, some 200 men of the 62 IB 
boarded 14 vehicles and left their base at Camp Tinio, Cabanatuan City, 
Nueva Ecija at 10:00 p.m. for a mission known only to a few of them. 
Upon reaching nearby Sta Rosa, some of the troops transferred to the 
four Baliwag Transit buses earlier arranged for by the PC provincial 
headquarters in Cabanatuan City. The convoy arrived at the Sta Rita 
toll gate at around 11:00 p.m. and waited for the other troops to arrive. 

At Camp Aguinaldo, Commo Marcelo called for an informal conference 
at 4:00 p.m., 27 August, attended by Capt Sonny Sabado and LtSG 
Alvaran, among others. Marcelo gave instructions on the actions to be 
taken in the light of a projected rebel attack on the camp. After the 
conference an hour later, Sabado and Alvaran returned to their unit, the 
Security and Escort Unit (SEU), to brief their chief, Lt Col Jerry Albano 
(PMA 71), who at the time was in a meeting at his office with Lt Jesus 
Quisano of NCRDC. When Quisano left, he ominously told one of the 
SEU personnel, "Maghanda kayo at may madugong labanan na 
mangy ay ari" 

Still at the camp, Lucas had been gathering a group of people at the 
lobby of the DND building supposedly to secure the Defense Department 
against any untoward incident. This began in the early evening of 27 
August and went on all night. They were later able to pressure Rolando 
Cabral, Supply Accountable Officer, to issue them weapons from the 
DND supply room. At 12:45 a.m., 28 August, CSAFP Ramos and Vice 
Chief of Staff de Villa decided to set up a GHQ advance command post 



CHAPTER IV 181 



at Camp Crame after receiving continuous intelligence reports of 
unauthorized troop formations in Nueva Ecija and Bulacan. Montano 
and later on, Ermita were assigned to take charge of GHQ, while the 
other service commanders were contacted and apprised of the situation. 
Ramos contacted Col Voltaire Gazmin, PSG commander, and discussed 
the adequacy of Malacanang* s defenses in view of the unusually large 
force reportedly moving toward Manila. 

Soriano, then chairman of the Cabinet Crisis Committee and National 
Security Adviser, joined Ramos and de Villa at Camp Crame a little after 
1:00 a.m. Soriano said he learned about the coup at 1:00 a.m. through 
one of his contacts in Davao. He contacted Ramos immediately who, in 
turn, asked him to join the battle staff at Crame. Weeks before the coup, 
the Crisis Committee had been meeting every other week. They knew 
something was brewing but did not know when it would be launched. 137 

In the meantime, the rebel troops had all arrived at the Sta Rita toll 
gate by midnight. All the men were instructed to transfer their flag 
patches over their breast pocket with the red portion on top. Honasan 
instructed Acosta and his men from 14 IB to head for the Ayala bridge 
near Malacanang. Most of the elements from the SOS PATRACOMand 
theRTS FSRR were to go directly to Camp Aguinaldo. It is not clear 
which troops Honasan himself led, but it may be surmised that he had 
under him a composite group made up of men from the units that met at 
the Sta Rita toll gate. 

6.1, Malacanang 

At about 1:45 a.m., 28 August, the rebels launched their attack on 
Malacanang. Some 20 rebels ransacked the armory of the Anti-Terrorist 
Task Force of the PSG at the foot of Nagtahan bridge. They attacked 
Malacanang from two directions along Aguila and J P Laurel Streets, but 
were blocked by PSG and CAPCOM elements deployed at all possible 
approaches. Afirefight ensued, where several men from both sides were 
Med or wounded. The V-150 under the command of rebel Capt 
%naldo Ordonez (PMA 78) was confronted by a Scorpion tank coming 
ft om the Malacanang area near St Jude Church. After Ordonez spoke 
* its driver, the tank withdrew and the V-150 later left for Camp 
Vinaldo. The 62 IB led by Ochosa arrived at the Nagtahan bridge area 
at2:0 ° a m., passing through La Loma. They engaged in a firefight with 
government troops, where three of their companions were killed while 
wowere wounded. After about 30 minutes, they too headed for Camp 
Aguinaldo. The men of the 14 IB led by Acosta arrived at the Ayala 
tadge at around 2:30 a.m. and were deployed on both ends of the bridge. 



182 



Later, after hearing shots from the area of Malacanang, they fired three 
rounds of flares to signal their withdrawal to Camp Aguinaldo. 

Unable to get into Malacaflang, the rest of the rebel troops under 
Honasan headed for Camp Aguinaldo through the Sta Mesa route. But 
in the course of their withdrawal, they shot at civilian onlookers who 
were jeering at them, killing 1 1 and wounding 54. Earlier, they had also 
fired at the convoy of President Aquino's son, Noynoy, who was then 
rushing home to Arlegui near Malacaflang. Noynoy was wounded, while 
his bodyguard was killed. Two other people died, and a third one was 
seriously wounded in the car behind them. 138 The Marine reinforcements 
led by Biazon composed of five companies and four LVTs arrived at the 
Malacanang area at 4:30 a.m., but the rebels had by then withdrawn to 
Camp Aguinaldo. 

G.2. Camp Aguinaldo 

At 1:00 a.m., just before the rebel attack on the Palace, the DBX 
telephone system at Camp Aguinaldo was evidently subverted, rendering 
the AFP communication network inoperative. When two technicians 
tried to fix it, Maj Romeo Ranay (PMA '74) of the AFP Computer System 
Center told them to keep it shut, allegedly on orders of Erfe. It remained 
shut for 13 1/2 hours. Ranay would return, several hours later, with 
orders to call up the Antipolo radio relay station and likewise shut off the 
repeaters there. The orders were complied with. 

Meanwhile, Marcelo was informed at 2:00 a.m. that the 2nd GHQ 
Battalion, composed of three companies and one APC, led by Col Luisito 
Sanchez (PMA '67) and five armored vehicles under the PALAB unit of 
Lt Col Luis Severo Melendez would be arriving to help secure Camp 
Aguinaldo. When they entered the camp, they were instructed to go to 
the GHQ grandstand and for Sanchez to report to the camp commander. 
However, instead of going to Marcelo's office, Sanchez went to the DND 
building to speak with Erfe. Later, in the crucial confrontation between 
rebels and government forces, Sanchez and Melendez would again 
refuse to follow orders to attack the rebel troops, saying "The Cory 
government is not worth dying for." 139 In fact, by 4:00 a.m., members of 
the PALAB unit had removed their flag patches and ammunition from 
their machine guns. 

A similar "neutral" behavior was observed of the SEU under Albano 
and Sabado. Both officers were later found to have ordered their men to 
stay in their barracks, instead of reinforcing the GHQ building, as had 
been their instructions. Albano and Sabado were subsequently found 



CHAPTER rv 183 



guilty of failure to do their utmost to suppress a mutiny or sedition in 
violation of Articles of War 68 (AW 68). 

At 3:00 a.m., the rebel forces under Lt Col Acosta, CO 14 IB, arrived 
outside Camp Aguinaldo' s Grate 1 but did not initiate any hostile action, 
until the long convoy of military vehicles and civilian buses full of 
heavily-armed mutineers arrived shortly after. Acosta's men again fired 
three flare shots to signal their arrival to other rebels inside the camp. 
Honasan then demanded entry through Gate 1 but was refused by 
Templo, then NCRDC Chief of Staff, together with Marcelo and Col 
Pedro Juachon (PMA '58), AFP Provost Marshal. Juachon reportedly 
told Honasan to return to Nueva Ecija with his men, but Honasan 
replied: "No way, sir. We came here and we've decided to stay." Juachon 
farther told him: "Gringo, it might help to let you know that we already 
have the order to hit you now, kawawa naman ang mga mamamatay 
mong tauhan because we will hit your tank with our tanks and the armor 
column is on its way out to Boni Serrano." Honasan supposedly 
answered, "It's alright, sir, we are prepared to neutralize your tanks." 140 

Failing to enter through Gate 1, the rebels went around Camp 
Aguinaldo through the White Plains Road and looked for abreak into the 
camp. Meanwhile, Lucas, with some 30 heavily armed men, left the 
DND building and went to Gate 5 where they overpowered the guards 
andforced them to open the gate, thus allowing Honasan's troops in. By 
about 5:00 a.m., rebel forces were inside the camp and were taking up 
their assigned positions. The 14 IB elements were deployed in the 
premises of Gates 2 and 3. Those from the 62 IB took charge of the area 
fronting the W Soliven building on EDSA, while Ochosa established his 
tactical command post at the Golf Club building. The SOS elements were 
deployed at Honasan's residence, the KKK, and the golf course. The SR 
Class #87-87 under Lina guarded the DND and COMMEL buildings, 
while SR Class #89-87 occupied positions in the area of the Mapping 
Center and the Civil Relations Service (CRS). The elements of the RTS 
FSRRalso occupied the CRS and MappingCenter surroundings, and the 
frontofthe GHQ building. The SR Class #88-87 were deployed in the golf 
wurse area. The 6 SR Coy under Antonio were initially deployed in the 
^cinityofthe CRS HQ, then transferred to the area of the Officers' (Row) 
Quarters. The 7 SR Coy under Purugganan, on the other hand, secured 
*e COMMEL area. 

After overpowering the guards at Gate 5, the group of Lucas went 
Jack to the DND building which served as rebel headquarters for the 
duration of the siege. Honasan had instructed the group of SOS (organic) 
P^onnel to position themselves within the perimeter of his house. He 



184 



told them their mission in going to Camp Aguinaldo was "to negotiate for 
the welfare of the Filipino" 141 Ordonez, for his part, also entered through 
Gate 5 in the V-150. After refueling at the camp, he went to PTV-4, 
then later came back to Camp Aguinaldo where he eventually 
abandoned the tank and its crew at 3:30 p.m. on 28 August. 

Earlier, Marcelo had sent Alvaran to Gate 5 to check what was 
happening there. Alvaran met Honasan along the way. Honasan 
allegedly told him: "Why did your MP try to stop us from entering our 
camp. I came here to reinforce you because the Aquino government 
has already sold us to the communists. Join me because what we are 
fighting for is for our children." 142 As Honasan answered a call on his 
handheld radio, Alvaran left and reported to Marcelo. 

In the meantime, an SEU reaction force led by Capt Vicente Cervano 
had been sent from within the camp to augment the guards at Gate 5, not 
realizing that it had already been completely overrun by rebels. When 
the SEU force arrived there, a PC SAF team was also there confronting 
some 300 heavily-armed rebel Scout Rangers with their supporting 
tank. Honasan then appeared and tried to win over the government 
troops. He told the SAF team that his men "will not fight them," and that 
they only went there because they had heard "the camp had been 
attacked by the NPA." With Honasan's group were Alcoba and Ordonez, 
classmate and armor instructor, respectively, of Cervano. Eventually, 
both the SAF team and the SEU force backed down. However, government 
forces were deployed at EDS A from Ortigas Avenue to Gate 5 to seal off 
the rebels inside the camp. 

By 8:00 a.m., the rebel forces had control of Gates 2, 3, 4 and 5, as 
well as the Communications Center (COMCENTER) and the surround- 
ings of GHQ building. Honasan went around talking with the officers 
and men, trying to convince them to join the rebel cause. He went to the 
SEU to speak with AJbano and Maj Jose Jamora, HSG commander. 
Later records show that Albano, Jamora, and Quisano had prior 
knowledge of the coup. By 9:00 a.m., the rebels had hoisted the inverted 
Philippine flag to show that they allegedly controlled the whole camp. 

At 9:30 a.m., the rebels were operating the armed forces radio DZAF 
and airing a casette tape which announced that Camp Aguinaldo, VAB, 
Regions I, II, III, and IV, and Cebu City were under rebel control led by 
Honasan. They repeatedly played this until 11:00 a.m. when there was 
a power failure. At 10:00 a.m., Robles and Maj Arsenio Santos, Jr were 
seen in fatigue uniforms walking towards the grandstand. An eyewitness 
later narrated that she had seen Robles earlier that morning talking 



CHAPTER IV 185 



with Mrs Honasan in the latter^ house, and had overheard him saying, 
"Minna angCOMMEL" 143 Robles subsequently denied his participation, 
and the CSAFP on 19 May 1988 approved the recommendation of the 
Board of Officers to drop and consider closed the case against Robles. 

Meanwhile, successive gunshots were heard all throughout the 
morning, from around 10:00 until the afternoon. On the government's 
side, a team had been sent to the rooftop of the W Soliven building 
overlooking Camp Aguinaldo, to monitor rebel troop movements. It was 
reported that boxes of ammunition and recoilless rifles were unloadedby 
rebels from a combi and Army jeep at the golf course around 10:40 a.m. 
Ithad earlier been reported that a helicopter had landed near Honasan's 
house loaded with food supplies. Meantime, Marine units from 
Zamboanga had been flown to Manila as reinforcements. Additional 
CAPC0M troops from Bicutan were sent to augment the PC forces in 
Camp Crame. Tanks and more troops were at the ready along EDSA, by 
the Corinthian Garden area. 

Ataround 11:30 a.m., government soldiers exchanged heavy gunfire 
with the rebels in front of Camp Crame, and Gates 2 and 3. Several 
civilian bystanders were hit in the crossfire. A counter attack was 
launchedby the CAPCOM combat group under Nazareno (later reinforced 
by 100 cadets of the National Police Academy) and a PA Counter- 
Terrorist (PACT) Battalion led by Col Rene Dado (PMA '66). A Marine 
TaskForceunderColBraulioBalbas, Jr(PMA'60), withMaj Emmanuel 
Teodisio (PMA 72), CO MBLT 2, breached the rebel defenses at Gate 2 
shortly afterwards. 

Carbonell, CO 703rd Brigade, and his men had been assigned to 
force their way through Gate 3, then go to the GHQ building to relieve 
*e pressure on MGen Ermita and BGen Montano. However, due to 
some lack of communication, Dado's PACT team, who by then had gotten 
control of Gate 3, were not informed of this, thus a misencounter occurred 
between both units. However, by mid- afternoon, the Marines managed 
to forcibly open Gate 3 and assault the rebel 62 IB elements, leading to 
their eventual surrender. 

In the meantime, fighting had broken out in front of the GHQ 
building, still controlled by Ermita and Montano. A firelight had also 
started at Gate 4, with three V-150s firing at the rebel troops who were 
weed to withdraw about 150 meters. Fighting intensified as Logistics 
Command (LOGCOM) forces attacked the rebels from behind at the 
°ND building. Two rebels were killed. By then, the 14 IB rebel group 
of Acosta had withdrawn towards the golf course area. At about 2:00 



186 



p.m., rebel soldiers burned the GHQ building to flush out Ermita and 
Montano. However, an air strike by two Tora-tora planes coming from 
Sangley Air Base relieved the rebel pressure on the government troops 
holed up in the GHQ. 

From then on, rebel troops gradually began to surrender. Many had 
earlier separated from their units, changed into civilian clothes and 
slipped out of the camp. Others had gone to the St Ignatius Chapel to 
surrender or to wait it out. Honasan was said to have left the camp in 
a Huey helicopter piloted by Capt Rogelio Seradoy , not longbefore the air 
strike by Tora-tora planes. There are at least two versions of Hon&san's 
escape from Camp Aguinaldo. One states that the helicopter ferried him 
to VAB, from where he escaped by land and the pilot (Seradoy) later 
abandoned the Huey at Camp Aquino, Tarlac. The other claims that a 
pilot, coming from Camp Olivas, flew to Camp Aguinaldo, picked up 
Honasan and brought him to an undisclosed place in Baguio. 144 

The government's air strike and marine attack seemed to have been 
decisive in the battle at Camp Aguinaldo. By 11:30 p.m., the camp had 
been cleared of all rebel elements with the capture or surrender of 12 
officers, including Lt Cols Acosta and Ochosa, Majs Purugganan and 
Lazaro, Capts Dantes, Calagui, and Legiralde, among others. With the 
retaking of Camp Aguinaldo from rebel h ands, the other rebel-held areas 
were easily regained. 

G.3. PTV-4/Camelot Hotel and Broadcast City 

The troop movements of the rebels who attacked PTV-4 began on 
27 August, at 7:00 p.m., when soldiers from the different PC line 
companies and police stations under the territorial supervision and 
control of the Nueva Ecija Constabulary Command began arriving at 
the PC HQ in Cabanatuan City. At 10:30 p.m., all the troops were 
ordered to board the various vehicles available and proceed to PTV-4, 
arriving there at around 1:30 a.m. 28 August. Upon arrival at the PTV- 
4 gate, one of the rebel soldiers shouted, "Ito na" signaling the exchange 
of gunfire between the attacking forces and the station's security force 
(5 GHQ Bn). The gunbattle ended after an hour, with five of the 
defending troops wounded. 

At 3:00 a.m., Matillano, Nueva Ecija Provincial Commander, and 
his men, numbering about 120, forcibly entered and occupied the 
Camelot Hotel, located near the PTV-4 station. One of the hotel 
executives, who was ordered to cut off the hotel's internal commu- 
nication system, overheard Matillano speaking over the telephone with 



CHAPTER IV 187 



Berroya in Pampanga. Some of the officers with Matillano were 
Assistant Provincial Commander Maj Eduardo Carino, Capt Jessie 
Arriola, Capt Cesario Valencia, Capt Antonio de la Cruz, Lt Paterno 
Orduna, Lt Demetrio Soriano Mamaed, 2Lt Ramon Colet Apolinario 
(PMA'85), and 2Lt Magno Biag. 

PTV4 and ABS-CBN, both located in the same compound on Bohol 
Avenue, went off the air when the network employees and other civilians 
caught inside began withdrawing from the area at about 9:20 a.m. The 
outnumbered military security of the station eventually abandoned 
theirposts due to exhaustion, hunger, and uncertainty of reinforcements 
by midmorning. The rebels then occupied PTV-4 and the Camelot Hotel 
simultaneously. 

At noon, on direct orders from President Aquino, combined elements 
of the police under P/BGen Alfredo Lim and the PC Special Action Force 
from Camp Crame led by Msg Avelino Razon, Jr (PMA '74) attacked the 
rebels at PTV-4. They were able to regain control of the station an hour 
and ahalf after heavy fighting, which resulted in the capture of 12 rebels. 

The rest of the rebels under Matillano then withdrew to the Camelot 
Hotel nearby where they held out until the late evening. A follow-up 
assault by government forces using two V-150s and 90 mm recoilless 
rifles, supported by a helicopter gunship, forced the rebels to negotiate 
their surrender at around 10:00 p.m. However, from mid-afternoon 
when guests and hotel employees were being allowed to leave, many of 
the rebels were able to slip out by changing into civilian clothes or 
uniforms of hotel employees and leaving with the civilians. 

On the same day, at 4:30 a.m., another group of rebels led by Maj 
Benhur Ferandez, 2Lts Marcelino Mendoza (PMA '81), and Andy 
Gauran (PMA '82) went to IBC-13 at Broadcast City and took over the 
television station. The station's chief security officer, Rodolfo Demillo, 
and some 63 soldiers under him put up little resistance. Some of the 
government troops from the 6 GHQ Bn under Lt Col Arsenio Esguerra, 
who had been sent to secure the station, even joined the rebel soldiers. 
These included Lt George Avila (PMA '84), Capts Jose Cruz, and 
Wilfredo Milagrosa. 

At around 9:00 a.m., RAM-HF officer LtSG Robert Lee (PMA '81) 
went to Broadcast City from the rebel-held Camp Aguinaldo. He was 
accompanied by TSgt Carlito Dematera and MSgt Buenaventura 
Clavecilla, both from the PC. Lee's mission was to broadcast over 
television the rebel's prepared statement, which he was eventually able 



188 



to do at 12:00 noon. With other young officers and soldiers in the 
background, Lee appeared as the rebel spokesman on IBC-13. He 
denounced the "overindulgence in politics which now pervades in 
society " and asserted the rebels' supposed role and responsibility to 
"initiate the struggle for justice, equality and freedom which our senior 
officers had failed to do." This seemed to unveil the increasingly popular 
belief, especially among the young officers, that the military, as an 
important social institution, had the overwhelming prerogative to 
determine what was good for the country. 

After the rebels read their manifesto on the air, IBC-13 as well as 
RPN-9 were knocked off the air by a power outage arranged by MERALCO. 
However, some technicians were able to activate their generators and 
put IBC-13 on the air again for rebel use at about 3:00 p.m. Among the 
civilians who were later found to have voluntarily and willingly assisted 
the rebels broadcast their propaganda were Jose and Manuel Jalandoon, 
Godofredo Lim, Felino Janairo, Domingo Torres, Enrique Ochangco, and 
Bert Honasan (brother of Lt Col Honasan). 

By the evening of 28 August, while the rebels were negotiating their 
surrender at PTV-4, the bulk of the combined police forces led by Lim 
went to retake Broadcast City. After a brief firefight, the government 
forces were able to regain control of the media stations by 11:00 p.m. 

G.4, Villamor Air Base 

"Red alert" had been declared at the base since 22 August due to the 
persistent rumors that another coup was going to be launched soon. 
Evidently, BGen Federico Pasion, VAB Commander and PAF Vice 
Commander, had issued an order that when the base siren sounded, all 
military personnel assigned in the different PAF Headquarters (HPAF) 
units should withdraw their firearms and ammunition, and secure their 
respective units as well as all gates to HPAF. This seemed like standard 
procedure, except that Pasion was later suspected of being a rebel 
sympathizer. 

When the siren sounded at 2:30 a.m., 28 August, Pasion together 
with rebel officers Lt Cols Dante Bernarte and Legaspi, Maj Baula, Jr, 
and their men occupied the first and second floors of the HPAF. MGen 
Sotelo was placed under siege in his office on the third floor. The 
directive of Pasion was for all the gates to be closed and only military 
personnel belonging to the HPAF would be allowed entry. Rebel troops 
controlled the lower floors of the HPAF, the 419th Air Force Motor 
Transport Squadron (AFMTS), Gates 1 and 2, the transient officer's 



quarters, and the ramp area where helicopters were parked. Also 
directly held hostage by the rebels was Sotelo's son, Nickie, whom the 
rebels forced to telephone his father several times to try to convince him 
to join the rebel cause, but MGen Sotelo was adamant. Subsequent 
reports revealed that Tarrazona had also contacted Sotelo at some time 
during that morning allegedly saying that the rebel force was "composed 
of 60,000 troops" and that they had to stage the coup because if they did 
not, "the communists would take over the next year." 146 

The takeover of VAB was said to have been planned in four phases: 
controlling the main gates, neutralizing aircraft parked in the base, 
demobilizing the motorpool, and occupying the first two floors of HPAF. 
The seizure of the HPAF was allegedly dependent on the rebels' holding 
Sotelo as hostage, guarding critical areas through the supposed assistance 
of Pasion, using the psychological presence of a V-150 armored vehicle 
(to be procured later by a rebel officer from Fort Bonifacio), and deploying 
armed troopers and base air police for the security of strategic places. 

At 3:00 a.m., rebel Capt Dionisio Balisacan and some 20 men from 
the 521st Air Police Squadron, of which he was EX-O, were able to 
enter the 419 AFMTS on the pretext of gassing up. Once inside, they 
surrounded and disarmed the soldiers there, saying they had been sent 
by Pasion. At about the same time, Col Alfredo Reyes, went to Gate 1 of 
VAB which was already rebel-controlled. He tried to convince the men 
toobeyhim, claiming he was the newly designated acting wing commander 
(WC) of the 520 ABW. Just then, Legaspi and Bernarte arrived and 
asked Reyes to stay "neutral" because by 12:00 noon, they claimed, 
everything would be over and there would be a new government. 
Bernarte further added, u Sa amin ka na t sir. Ginagamit ka lang nila." 
Failing to convince the rebels, Reyes left. 

At the 205 HW Wing Operations Center (WOO, the first indication 
that things were not normal was when they received a call at 4:10 a.m. 
from A2 asking for additional troops to secure the CG PAF. Thus, a force 
kd by Capt Lauro Catalino de la Cruz (PMA '80) was sent to HPAF . 

At around 5:00 a.m., Sotelo, despite being hostaged in his office, 
ordered the manning of all helicopters in the line. However, this was not 
possible because the whole parking area was by then controlled by the 
rebel 521st Air Police Squadron personnel. They had a jeep mounted 
with a .50 cal machine gun and a recoilless rifle trained on the choppers, 
ft was later agreed between the rebel officers there (Bernarte, Maj 
Lorenzo Luistro (PMA 74) and Capt Pablo Honrade) and a pro- 
government officer sent to negotiate,that the 205 HW pilots would not fly 



190 



the helicopters on condition that neither would the rebels. Thus, a 
temporary stand-off was reached. 

At 6:00 a.m., an Air Force Rescue Development Center was hurriedly 
organized, consistingof one officer and 19 enlisted men. It was composed 
of three striking forces, one of which was led by Maj Dexter Huerto. 
Huerto's team was tasked to observe the activities of the rebels at Gate 
1, VAB, particularly of Bernarte, and if possible, to isolate him from the 
group. The team observed about 20 rebels manning Gate 1, amongthem 
Bernarte, Capt Roberto de la Pena, and MSgt Elmo Glorioso. They also 
saw two mini-cruisers, one with a mounted machine gun, a buggy, a 
passenger jeep, and a maroon car parked near the gate. All of this 
information was reported back to the PAF leadership. 

In the meantime, BGen Loven Abadia, 205 HW WC, was able to 
make it back to the base at about 8:00 a.m. from Mactan, where he had 
been on official business when the coup broke out. Abadia immediately 
called for a conference of his officers. At around 9:30 a.m., a firefight 
erupted at the HPAF building between the rebels and troops loyal to the 
government. This went on for about an hour. At 1:00 p.m., rebel Msg 
Allen Querubin (PMA 74) LABde operations officer, took out without 
authorization a V-150 combat vehicle from Fort Bonifacio into VAB. He 
ordered the driver of the tank to go to the Air Police HQ, apparently 
based on previous agreement with VAB rebels. At that very moment, 
with their actions covered by government forces on the ground, Abadia 
led a group of pilots to take off in the helicopters guarded by the rebels. 
Continuous firing went on until the five helicopters were able to take off. 
They landed in Fort Bonifacio some 15 minutes later. 

The getaway of the helicopters accomplished two purposes: the 
escape from rebel stranglehold of the helicopters and pilots, and as aruse 
to allow Gen Sotelo to make a run for it from the HPAF building 
controlled by the rebels. Shortly after the helicopters landed at Fort 
Bonifacio, Col Ruben Ciron (PMA '68) accompanied by another person 
reportedly approached Capt Jorge de Jesus (PMA '79) to try to convince 
the latter not to send out helicopters against the rebels, seeming to imply 
that he was on the rebels' side. When de Jesus suggested that he talk 
with Abadia, Ciron left without a word. 14 * 

With the AOC serving as the temporary command post of Gen 
Sotelo, PAF air operations in support of government troops in the coup 
resumed. For example, a helicopter was able to check the reported 
advance of a convoy of rebel reinforcement troops at the Calamba 
entrance to the South Expressway. 



CHAPTER IV 191 



Back at VAB, rebel forces began withdrawing from Grates 1, 2, and 
3 of the base at 5:00 p.m. By 6:30 p.m., the siege had ended and the rebels 
had left. Residents of VAB reported that they saw rebels board three 10- 
wheeler Army trucks and head for the South Expressway at around 7:45 
p.m. On 29 August, combined forces of the 205 HW and 420 SW 
pressured the rest of the PAF rebels, mostly from the 520 ABW, into 
surrendering. 

It was subsequently reported that elements of the 49 IB led by 
' Aromin had left their station in Guinyangan, Quezon on 28 August in 
answer to the call for rebel reinforcements from Legaspi at VAB, and in 
clear defiance of an earlier order from their superior officer. However, 
when the troops arrived at VAB at 7:30 p.m., 28 August, the siege had 
ended and the rebels had withdrawn. Aromin thus ordered his troops 
back to their station and then went on AWOL himself the next day. 

G.5. RECOM 3 - Camp Olivas, Pampanga 

The rebel occupation of Camp Olivas was effected by parallel actions 
on two fronts: an "internal group" that simply declared they were taking 
over, and an "external group" that invaded the camp. 

From as early as 27 August, in the evening, BGen Eduardo Taduran 
(PMA '58), RECOM 3 Commander, had been receiving continuous 
reports of unauthorized troop movements in Nueva Ecija (probably 
Honasan's group). At 10:00 p.m. , he called his battle staff to a conference 
and ordered the implementation of a Oplan Dimatarusan," which called 
for the setting up of check points and blocking forces, among other 
things. 

Meanwhile, the "external rebel group" was getting ready and their 
staging point was at Valle Verde Lodge in San Fernando, Pampanga. 
The rebel officers who assembled at the lodge on the evening of 27 August 
reportedly included Berroya;Majs Cabauatan, Divina, Nestor Sanares 
( p MA '73), and Alejandro Lapanid (PMA 73); Capts Teofilo Melliza 
(PMA 77), Roque Maranon (PMA 77), Pacifico Avenido, Jr (PMA 78), 
Loreto de la Cruz, Montano Nazario, and Christopher Mesias; Lt Abner 
Kmabuyo (PMA '82); 2Lt Agripino Javier (PMA '85); and others. While 
there, the officers and the soldiers they brought along with them were 
given or asked to invert their flag patches, red side on top over their left 
breast pocket, as a countersign. Firearms and ammunition were also 
distributed. The rebels then left for Camp Olivas in separate convoys 

apparently at different times. 



192 



The PC checkpoint set up along the Gapan-Olongapo road allegedly 
tried to hold off the convoy of 2Lt Javier's group heading towards Camp 
Olivas, but later allowed them to pass through when the rebels pointed 
their guns at them. The convoy consisted of one PC mini-cruiser, one 10- 
wheeler, six cars, and one V-150 as back-up. When the convoy arrived 
at the camp, they passed through the gate without resistance. It was 
even reported that by that time, many military men within the camp 
were already sporting inverted flag patches, and the flag in front of the 
administration building had also been inverted. 

Even as the battle staff was meeting at Taduran's office at midnight, 
elements of the RSAF 3 led by Maj Clifordo Noveras (PMA '73) had began 
to occupy the administration building, specifically surrounding the 
Regional Commander's office. At 2:00 a.m., Taduran was informed that 
Camp Olivas was under the control of the rebels led by Berroya, and that 
at that very moment the rebels were already occupying the offices below. 
Taduran sent two of his officers to find out what the rebels' intentions 
were. Later, RECOM officers locked themselves inside Taduran's office, 
The rebel RSAF 3 elements then fired flares to signal Berroya's group to 
enter the camp. 

As a matter of fact, Javier's group left the Valle Verde Lodge at 2:00 
a.m. and arrived at the camp at 4:30 a.m. Upon arrival, Javier ordered 
his troops to occupy the second floor and rooftop of the administration 
building. The rebels then forced the signal officer to shut off the 
communication lines inside the camp. The principal purpose of the rebel 
takeover of Camp Olivas was supposedly to prevent reinforcement of 
government troops in Manila emanating from the camp and to declare 
the regional command in rebel hands, for propaganda purposes. 

By around 9:00 a.m., reports from Camp Olivas to Camp Crame said 
that Berroya had taken over as RECOM 3 Commander, with Maj Divina 
as his deputy, and Noveras as the camp commander. It was also reported 
that a helicopter had taken off for an air reconnaissance flight. When 
it came back, Sanares, Nazario, and its pilot, Mesias, went to report to 
Berroya. 

At 6:00 p.m., another helicopter arrived at the camp. A meeting 
among the rebels was reportedly held on the ground floor of the 
administration building. At 9:00 p.m., Taduran was informed that the 
rebels were going to change their command post to Basa Air Base and 
would bring him and his key officers with them. Taduran refused to go 
with them, instead he and his officers decided they would stay put at 
all costs. 



CHAPTER IV 193 



Perhaps due to the failure of the mutiny in Manila, Berroya went to 
see Taduran at 11:00 p.m. to inform him that they would be clearing out 
before midnight. Also, perhaps sensing that government troops were 
dosing in on the camp, Berroya and his men quickly slipped out of Camp 
Olivas so that when the liberating forces arrived at 11:30 p.m., the 
mutineers were no longer around. By 6:00 a.m., 29 August, it was 
reported that the situation in RECOM 3 was back to normal. However, 
subsequent investigations found Taduran and his staff to have failed "to 
do their utmost" to defend Camp Olivas because at the time they had 
given up without resistance to the RSAF forces of Noveras, they still 
outnumbered the rebels who were only 75 at the time. It was only at 4:30 
a.m. that the convoy of rebel troops from Valle Verde Lodge arrived. 
Moreover, it was felt that if the RECOM officers had thought their forces 
were not enough to resist the rebels, they could have asked for 
reinforcements from the Zambales or Bataan Constabulary Commands, 
whose commander had offered his troops earlier. 

G.6. RECOM 7 - Cebu 

The rebel actions in Cebu were, unlike in any of the other locations, 
dictated from the top. The Regional Commander himself had openly and 
directly supported the rebels, thus the widespread effect of his authority 
became a boon to the rebel cause, especially in terms of propaganda. 
However, in order not to pre-empt the events in Manila, RECOM 7 
Commander BGen Edgardo Abenina (PMA '58) did not immediately 
announce his defection. 

At 3:00 a.m., 28 August, Abenina called up all the major service unit 
commanders in his area and informed them of the occurrence of a coup 
in Manila. At 4 :30 a.m. , he sent a radiogram to all provincial commanders 
and the Cebu Metropolitan District Command (Metrodiscom) CO, with 
this apparently deceiving text: "In view of recent developments in Metro 
Manila, fortify your stations and strengthen your camp defenses. Do not 
allow any movement of troops and take slant. Obey orders only coming 
from me, repeat only orders coming from me." 

By 8:40 a.m., there were reports about the stand of the RECOM 7 
Commander to support the rebels. An hour later, Abenina called up 
BGen Dominico Casas (PMA '59), WC, 220th Airlift Wing (220 AW) 
based in Mactan to ask him to join RECOM 7 in support of the rebels, but 
*as turned down by Casas. The latter also denied requests from 
Abenina to release a C-130 transport plane to pick up rebel troops from 
JJgaspi City and ferry them to VAB, as well as the appeal to close down 
M *ctan Airport. At about th e same time, Abenina and all his officer s met 



194 



with the RECOM 7 soldiers at the HQ parking lot to explain the rebel 
movement which was allegedly done in the interest of soldiers and 
policemen, and to ask for their support. 

At 10:00 a.m., Abenina came out publicly in support of the rebels. He 
went on the air over DYLA radio and announced that the entire PC/INP 
RECOM 7 was backing the rebels. Abenina said, "We have decided to 
take this stand because we feel that our rights as citizens and policemen 
have been abridged and trampled by the policies of the present 
government* He further added, "We shall be in this status until the 
cause we have been fighting for shall be properly attended to." 147 He 
ordered the takeover of three government buildings and two residences, 
the hoisting of the Philippine flag with its red field on top, and the closure 
of TV and radio stations, except for DYLA which they used for rebel 
propaganda. Abenina also asked Col Anselmo Avenido, Jr (PMA'67) CO 
Cebu Metrodiscom, to secure the city and municipal halls in his area, 
secure the mayors, and request the media stations to stop broadcasting 
temporarily until further notice. Moreover, he asked Maj Digman 
Cenon, Assistant Provincial Commander of Cebu, to secure the provincial 
capitol. *■ 

Later, RECOM 7 officers carried out their commander's orders by 
taking over the PNB offices in Cebu, the Land Bank and its premises, the 
Central Bank regional office, and the DBP-Cebu branch. Similar 
defections and takeovers, but in a minor degree, occurred in Toledo City, 
Siquijor, Cordova, and Naga on the island of Cebu, as well as in 
Dumaguete under Col Samuel Tomas (PMA '67), and Tagbilaran under 
Maj Irving Malunda and P/Capt Benjamin Absalon. Closely assisting 
Abenina in generating support for the rebel cause were, among others, 
Lt Col Hiram Benatiro, RECOM 7 operations officer; Lt Col RodolfoTor 
(PMA '72), RECOM 7 intelligence officer; Lt Col Neon Ebuen (PMA '71), 
Region 7 AFPSLAI Manager; Lt Col Tiburcio Fusilero (PMA '71); andLt 
Cecil Sandalo (PMA '80), RECOM 7 administrative officer. 

Despite the constant requests made by Abenina to Casas to join the 
rebel cause, close down Mactan Airport, and send a C-130 aircraft to fly 
rebel reinforcements to Manila, the latter allegedly refused each time, 
but apparently did not actively attempt to engage Abenina's troops. 
Records show that on several occasions a week before the coup, Abenina 
had made similar appeals for planes to ferry him and his men to Manila, 
but had been refused. 148 BGen Romulo Querubin, then RUC 7 
Commander, also apparently did not actively check Abenina's unlawful 
activities nor arrested him, allegedly because the "flow of information 
was delayed" and the latter "had not taken any hostile action against the 



CHAPTER IV 195 



military.* 149 Querubin, along with his officers, Cols Apolinario Castano 
(PMA'58) and Miguel Abaya (PMA '59), were subsequently found to have 
been indecisive in their actions towards Abenina and the mutiny, and 
thus reprimanded under Articles of War 105. On 29 August, Abenina 
was relieved as RECOM 7 Commander and placed under technical 
arrest. Col Mariano Baccay, Jr (PMA , 59), his deputy, took over as acting 
Regional Commander. Casas was likewise relieved from his post. 

G.7. Legaspi City Airport 

On 28 August, at 4:00 a.m., elements of the Albay PC/INP Command 
consisting of six PC officers, one INP officer and some 135 military 
personnel took control of the Legaspi City Airport for about 27 hours. 
The officers involved were Capt Leovic Dioneda (PMA '78) CO 255 PC 
Coy stationed in Tiwi; Capt Reynaldo Rafal (PMA 79) CO 254 PC Coy 
based in Ligao; Lt Renato Hernandez, OIC 251 PC Coy based in Camp 
Bagong Ibalon; Lt Diosdado Valeroso, Intelligence and Operations; 2Lt 
Eliseo Rasco (PMA '86) Junior Officer Coy RSAF Bn; 2Lt Allan Cuevillas 
(PMA '87) Squad leader of V- 150; and P/Lt Lito Pitallano, Malilipot INP 
Station Commander. The group, using the rebel countersign of inverted 
flagpatches, arrived in two 6x6 trucks, two mini-cruisers, a Toyota staff 
car, and a V- 150 commando vehicle. They hoisted three Philippine flags, 
with the red on top, at the airport and posted men at the arrival and 
departure areas, runway and control tower. They claimed that on orders 
of Batac, Albay Provincial Commander, they would be picked up by a C- 
130 aircraft to ferry them to Manila. We now know that the plane never 
arrived, because it was never released in Cebu. 

Before he left for Manila on 26 August, Batac had requested in 
writing the RECOM 5 Commander for two 6 x 6 trucks and a V-150 
commando vehicle to be available at 10:00 p.m., 27 August, supposedly 
for the use of Albay PC/INP command operations. The request was 
granted with SSgt Rodelito Katigbak, SSgt Alberto Ribay, and 2Lt 
Cuevillas as drivers for the two trucks, and squad leader of the V-150, 
respectively. Cuevillas later voluntarily joined the rebel forces when 
they took over Legaspi Airport. 

At about 6:30 a.m., Lt Col Melecio Asis, Jr and Capt Jose Arne de los 
Santos (PMA '79) went to the airport to verify the report they had 
reived about armed men roaming around the airport premises. While 
*ere, they spoke with Dioneda, Rafal, and Valeroso who claimed their 
°nly purpose in positioning themselves there was to "insure airport 
security" while they waited for the plane to transport them to Manila. 
% added that they would only take orders from their provincial 



196 



commander, Batac, who had left for Manila on 26 August supposedly on 
orders of the Secretary of National Defense (SND). The rebels were 
insistent that they would remain there until their aircraft came but that 
they would not commit any violent acts against other military units of 
the RECOM or against any civilians. 

Earlier, Valeroso, acting as spokesman of the group, contacted local 
radio stations by phone and announced that they were supporting the 
so-called "idealist" soldiers whohad launched in Metro Manila and other 
parts of the country what he termed as "the continuation of the EDSA 
Revolution". 

Meanwhile, BGen Luis San Andres (PMA '57) RECOM 5 Commander, 
assembled his staff to analyze the situation and take appropriate 
actions. The provincial commanders of Cam arines Norte and Sur were 
contacted to set up checkpoints and roadblocks to prevent any rebel 
reinforcements passing through their areas. Then several people were 
called to try and convince the rebel group at the 'airport to give up their 
plan, among them, Bishop Concordio Sarte of Legaspi City, Col Diony 
Ventura (PMA '67), Lt Col Orbase, and P/Lt Fuentes. Relatives and 
families of the rebel soldiers were also contacted to convince their 
relatives-soldiers to forego their plans. Philippine Airlines (PAL) in 
Legaspi was advised to cancel all afternoon flights in order to deny the 
rebels any access to the planes. Moreover, the Albay Electrical Cooperative 
was told to cut off power at the airport to prevent any landings at night 
time. 

For their part, the rebels held a press conference at the airport cargo 
check-in area at 5:30 p.m., presided by Dioneda, Rafal, and Valeroso. 
They had spent the whole day in giving interviews, and press releases 
and undertaking other propaganda efforts. The rebel leaders aired their 
alleged grievances, including their perception of government mishandling 
of the insurgency problem and the deplorable economic conditions of the 
rebels. After the press conference, RECOM 5 emissaries relayed to the 
rebels the assurance of San Andres that no offensive actions would be 
taken against them during the night. Furthermore, according to de Villa 
who had called San Andres earlier, the rebels would not be subjected to 
in vestigations in connection with the coup, if they returned peacefully to 
their stations. At 8:00 p.m., Dioneda sent word to San Andres that he 
and his men would pull out from the airport at 7:00 a.m. the next day. 

On 29 August, at 7:00 in the morning, Dioneda and his men cleared 
out of the Legaspi City airport as promised, with no violent incident 
happening. Regular flights continued after the rebels vacated the area. 



CHAPTER IV 197 



G.8. Minor Incidents 

Three minor incidents merit inclusion here as they reveal what could 
be classified as rebel strongholds in the military: 16 IB, Fort Magsaysay, 
and PMA in Baguio. 

G.8.a- 16th Infantry Battalion 

In the early morning of 28 August, even before news of the rebel 
attack on Malacanang spread, Maj Eufemio Santos and Lt Caraig, Jr 
instructed their men in the 16 IB based in Tigaon, Camarines Sur to 
prepare for a military operation. The men were issued firearms and 
ammunition. At 8:00 a.m., Santos and some 150 battalion soldiers 
boarded three 6x6 trucks, two mini-cruisers and one Philtrancobus, and 
headed for Manila, escorted by a V-150 armored vehicle and three 
crewmen of the 4 PALAB, Maj Morris Perez CO 16 IB, who had that 
morning arrived at Legaspi City from Manila, caught up with the convoy 
in Labo, Camarines Norte, and from there, took charge of the troops. 

Their mission appeared to be to join the rebel forces in Manila. 
However, when they reached Lopez, Quezon province at noon, they were 
blocked by Col Conrado Infortuno (PMA '58), a batallion commander 
from the 202 Bde. They were then instructed by BGen Alejandro Galido 
(PMA'58), CG 2 ID, via radio to proceed to Camp Capinpin, Tanay, Rizal, 
in an attempt to neutralize them. When the battalion reached Atimonan, 
Quezon at 8:00 p.m., Perez decided to bring the men back to their 
headquarters in order to avoid a possible violent confrontation with 
S0LCOM elements manning checkpoints along their route. Upon their 
arrival at Tigaon on 29 August, 7:30 a.m., Perez, Santos, and Caraig 
proceeded to the 102 Bde HQ in Pili, Camarines Sur and reported to 
BGen Abraham Manuel (PMA '57), Brigade Commander. The next day, 
they went to Camp Capinpin and reported to Galido, who placed them 
under technical arrest. The 16 IB enlisted personnel were later redistri- 
buted to different line units by the SOLCOM in its counter-insurgency 
operations. Only 15 from the battalion were subjected to an investigation 
in connection with the 28 August 1987 coup attempt. It must be remem- 
bered that the 16 IB was also the unit supposedly implicated in the 
original RAM plot to overthrow Marcos in February 1986. It was then 
commanded by Malajacan. 

G.8.b. Fort Magsaysay 

Maj Horacio Lactao (PMA 74), CO 3 LAB, had already been suspected 
88 sympathizing, if not supporting the group of Honasan. On 27 August, 



198 

at 10:30 p.m., Army headquarters called Col Antonio Yamzon CO PA 
TRACOM in Fort Magsaysay, Nueva Ecija, and told him to keep an eye 
on Lactao as he was apparently "being pressured" to join the coup 
plotters. 150 After the call, Yamzon went to Lactao' s office and "invited" 
the latter to stay with him at his (Yamzon's) office, with the intention 
of preventing him from going to Manila to join the rebels. Lactao went 
with Yamzon. After breakfast on 28 August, however, Lactao asked 
permission to return to his HQ and by 5:00 p.m., the troops of Lactao 
were ready to leave. Consisting of two Scorpion tanks, two armored 
infantry fighting vehicles, two V-150s, and some APCs, the force of 
Lactao supposedly overpowered that of the PATEACOM, thus, Yamzon 
claimed he had no choice but to let them go. Aside from the combat 
vehicles, Lactao's men also availed of one 6x6 truck, two Pepsi-Cola 
delivery trucks, and a number of military and civilian vehicles. 

On their way to Manila, perhaps discovering that the rebels had 
already lost in the capital and that there would be no troops to reinforce, 
the 3 LAB under Lactao decided to return to Fort Magsaysay at 9:00 p.m. 
They arrived there at 11:30 a.m., 29 August, after which Lactao reported 
to Yamzon. 

G.8.C. PMA - Baguio 

The move by PMA cadets to support the coup effort in Manila came 
too late. ^However, it would be difficult to deny the propaganda leverage 
the rebels gained from the public declaration of support by the whole 
cadet corps. On 28 August, at noon, two broadcasters from Radio Bombo 
in Baguio attended a gathering of some 30 officers at PMA They 
interviewed Lt Fernando Baltazar (PMA '81), who claimed to be the 
spokesman of the group, and Capt Gregorio Catapang. When asked 
about the events in Manila, Baltazar replied that speaking for the 
junior officers at PMA, they were supporting the cause of Honasan's 
group , and renouncing allegiance to the government of President Aquino. 
Furthermore, if asked, he added, he would personally go down to Manila 
to support Honasan. At the mess hall, then Cdt (1C) Allen Paredes (PMA 
'88) read a prepared statement saying, "In behalf of the Cadet Corps 
Armed Forces of the Philippines, we hereby affirm our stand by the 
principle of anti-communism which the forces of Col Honasan are 
fighting for." 151 By 1:00 p.m., the interviews and statements of the cadets 
had been aired on Radio Bombo of Baguio, creating quite a stir among the 
public. 



At 4:00 p.m., a group of four cadets went to the radio station DZWT 
of St Louis University in downtown Baguio and submitted a longer 



CHAPTER IV 199 



statement supposedly expressing the sentiments of the cadet corps. 
They said in consideration of the events of the past 24 hours, PMA 
Classes of 1988 to 1991 were reaffirming their support for the rebel 
cause. Moreover, they believed that politicians should observe a "hands- 
off policy in purely military affairs; that persons in authority must 
exercise justice and good sense in dealing with the rebel soldiers, 
avoiding drastic solutions; and that there should be a dialogue between 
the government and rebel representatives with full media coverage. 

An hour later, three other cadets accompanied by Maj Wilhelm 
Doromal, a PMA tactical officer, went to Radio Bombo in Baguio to 
submit still another manifesto of support. It said that to protect the 
inherent right of the people as mandated by the Constitution, they 
supported the movement seeking the establishment of a better govern- 
ment, and that in order to move the country from imminent collapse, the 
cadet corps was pledging lfcs support to the reformist cause. The 
manifesto was taped and aired over the radio. 152 

By midnight, the cadets were getting ready for unauthorized 
deployment. They received a briefing from Capt Alfredo Bambico, Jr 
(PMA '78), PMA Tactics Group, on the camp defense plan and the 
moving out of cadets from Fort del Pilar to the different roads of entry to 
Baguio City, particularly Kennon Road, Naguillan Road, and Marcos 
Highway. Evidently, the intention was to serve as blocking forces 
against "unfriendly" forces that would enter Baguio, although it was not 
clear why they wanted to isolate Baguio, unless the rebels were thinking 
of making a last stand there. Among the other officers present at the 
briefing were Kapunan, then a PMA instructor, and Nelson Eslao, both 
former PMA classmates of Honasan. It will be recalled that Eslao was 
we RAM contact for the Kamalayan election campaign drive at PMA in 
February 1986, when he served as Assistant Commandant of Cadets. 153 

On 29 August, at 2:00 a.m., the PMA cadets boarded two 6 x 6 trucks 
one bus procured by Kapunan. They began moving out with 
atapang in a jeep that was to lead the convoy. However, they were 
wpped at the PMA checkpoint. Catapang got down to talk to someone 
Jtoegate, then came back shortly after to say the whole thing was off. 
w coup they were supporting in Manila had failed. 

The following day, two cadets delivered a copy of their letter of 
it SKn^ Tebels to the Bfl ^° Midland Courier, which published 
11 restive, some cadets were reported to be arming themselves and 
wmingto go around Baguio. This was thwarted when Col Lisandro 
^ (PM A '62) Commandant of Cadets, confronted them in their 



200 



barracks. Their planned strike in support of the rebels was aborted when 
PMA officials initiated a series of dialogues to thresh out the cadets' 
grievances. 

G.9. The Aftermath 

The 28 August coup attempt lasted for about a day and a half. In 
the end, there were some 53 people dead and more than 200 wounded, 
many of them civilian bystanders who were sprayed with bullets as they 
chided the rebels and cheered for the government troops in the area of 
Malacanang. 154 This was the first time coup participants had ever fired 
directly at unarmed civilians, an act that has done irreparable damage 
to the rebels' reputation and credibility. The failed coup was participated 
in by around 2,160 military personnel, with damage to properties 
surpassing millions of pesos. The Camelot Hotel alone suffered over Ti 
million in property losses, while the burned GHQ building was estimated 
to be worth over 1*41 million. 156 Then, there were the television stations 
whose sophisticatedequipment.costingmillionsofpesos, were destroyed 

in varying degrees. 

As an immediate reaction to the coup, the militant Coalition Against 
Oil Price Increase (COAPI) cancelled their protest against increased 
gasoline rates and the crack-down on participants of the Welgang Bayan. 
The demonstration had been scheduled for 31 August. Other reactions 
to the coup included panic-buying and hoarding of food supplies, 
withdrawals of money from the banks, power outages in some areas near 
Camp Aguinaldo because MERALCO facilities had been damaged by 
heavy fighting, people flocking to buy gasoline, among others. to 
general, it was bad for business because of the uncertainty it created, and 
also bad for the tourist industry, where again hotels suffered huge losses 
in cancellations of bookings not only for individuals but for conferences 
and conventions that were going to be held in the country. 

In Congress, bills were rushed to grant pay increases to soldiers. 
Across-the-board salary increases for the whole AFP were unprece- 
dentedly granted (106 percent for a Master Sergeant, to 36 percent for 
a General). Furthermore, there was a joint Senate and House inves- 
tigation on the coup attempt supposedly to determine whether anti- 
govemment politicians, including deposed President Marcos andrightist 
elements in the US government, were behind the mutiny. Opposition 
Senator Enrile strongly denied any involvement in the coup. He saidhe 
deliberately made himself unavailable to the press because he had no 
knowledge of it and could not answer any questions about it. In & 
interview over DZRH, Senator Enrile was ambivalent at one point, 



CHAPTER IV 201 



refusingto make any statement of "condemnation or absolution". Then, 
he said he did not make any statements because "he did not want to get 
involved," and that because those men once served under him (referring 
to Honasan, et al), the least he could do was to keep quiet. Later in the 
interview, however, he capitulated by saying the mutineers should 
"rethink their positions." 156 

Many political watchers believe that the 28 August coup attempt 
pulled the Aquino administration towards the right in the ideological 
spectrum. They cite, as an example, her having sacked Joker Arroyo as 
Executive Secretary in reaction to the rebels' demand to rid the Cabinet 
of supposedly left-leaning members. Another example was President 
Aquino's tacit approval of armed quasi-military groups by renaming the 
Civilian Home Defense Forces (CHDF) as Civilian Armed Forces Geo- 
graphical Units (CAFGU). Others believe Gen Ramos emerged as the 
second most powerful person in government as a result of the attempt. 
There are some, however, who think the coup revealed some discontent 
within the Armed Forces against the leadership of the Chief of Staff(e.g., 
oneofHonasan's demands was the resignation of Ramos). 157 

It was said that the police emerged with a new role after 28 August. 
They were given the task of retaking the media stations and they 
succeeded. Some observed that the reason for their effectiveness was 
that they were not bound by the fraternal ties that allegedly inhibit 
soldiers from fighting soldiers, and therefore, they had less hesitation to 
shoot at the rebels. 158 

The simultaneous lightning attacks by rebels on key target areas 
tang the 28 August coup constituted a marked improvement in 
strategy compared to the earlier coup attempts. However, these were not 
supported by sufficient forces to execute a successful seizure (as what 
happened in Malacanang), or to sustain control over the occupied area. 
Time was an important factor for both sides. If the rebels had held on to 
foose installations long enough to produce a stalemate, then it could 
Perhaps have induced the shift of allegiance by some regional and 
Provincial commands who may have been wavering to their side. On the 
government's side, it had to act quickly and attack early (as it did in 

* m P Aguinaldo and the television stations), before any of the rebel 
reinforcements arrived. As in all the past attempts, however, the rebels 
not receive any widespread popular backing despite their having 

°sen ™ timing of the coup to coincide with massive discontentment 
J^nst the government. Surely, the best gauge for the success or failure 

acoup is whether the people would support the alternative that the 
Plotters offer.

H. Concluding Observations on Military Interventions, 
1986 - 1987 

The political events in the last four years have shown that the 
Philippines has firmly been introduced to the phenomenon of military 
intervention in politics. When analyzed collectively, the series of coup 
attempts, starting from the February 1986 plot to the August 1987 one, 
present a pattern of interwoven factors that put forward the idea of a 
continuing effort by a group of determined military officers, backed by 
their civilian supporters, to overthrow the administration of President 
Aquino and install a military junta. Although there are some variations 
to this pattern, the underlying image remains the same, that is, there 
were two main groups of people behind all the destabilizing activities 
which culminated in the seven coup attempts discussed in this chapter. 
The groups are the RAM, or more accurately after February 1986, a 
faction of the RAM under Honasan, and the so-called Marcos loyalistsled 
by Zumel. Ironically, they were the opposing protagonists in the 
February 1986 coup attempt who were both left' out after EDSA 

Following this line of argument, the coup attempts may thus be 
classified into those led by the RAM-HF, those by loyalists, and those 
that reveal a possible connection between the two. This is despite th$ 
fact that Honasan had scoffed at the idea of an alliance with the Marcos 
followers, saying that the younger officers of the RAM who were uncom- 
promising idealists would never tolerate working with soldiers and 
civilians tainted by association with the dictator's excesses. 169 The 
February 1986 plot was definitely a brainchild and product of the RAM. 
The July 1986 Manila Hotel Incident, on the other hand, was a loyalist 
attempt, but may have been known to some RAM officers. The latter 
may have bailed out a few of the loyalist plotters, possibly to earn their 
goodwill for some future collaboration. The November 1986 "God Save 
The Queen" plan was principally a RAM-HF plot but could have been 
another attempt at some sort of collaboration between the two groups. 
But because the coup was never launched, the extent of collusion is not 
clear. The January 1987 plot re veals an other loyalist effort, even if again 
Honasan seemed to have stepped in to intervene during the negotiations 
for the surrender of the rebels at GMA-7. The April 1987 destabilizing 
activity should not really be considered a coup, but rather a loyalist 
instigated jailbreak and short-lived blitz possibly intended for propaganda 
purposes. On the other hand, the July 1987 attempt appears to have 
consisted of separate plots by the two groups, though due to the lack of 
official information available on the events, it is difficult to pinpoint 
responsibility. The July effort may have been the premature version of 
the August plot, which was principally led and executed by RAM-HF, but 



CHAPTER IV 203 



with the apparent support of some loyalists. The Commission has 
received testimony that in the Manila Hotel and GMA-7 incidents, the 
RAM-HF planned to step in if the Marcos loyalists were able to produce 
a critical mass of at least 500,000 people. 160 Whether there was an 
explicit "understanding* between the two groups is not established. It 
is clear, however, that the so-called tactical alliance between the Zumel 
and Honasan groups in December 1989 had its antecedents and should 
not have been a surprise to anyone who had done an analysis of the 
linkages between them in previous coups. 

Seen as a whole, the seven cases that were discussed here reveal 
certain common features, as well as some innovations unique to parti- 
cular attempts at political intervention by a section of the Armed Forces. 
Among the common characteristics, we find that each attempt was 
launched during a period of crisis, when the government was perceived 
to be at its weakest and when people were generally at their most 
vulnerable. Observing the political and economic conditions during each 
coup attempt, thus, gives an idea of the different settings that were 
deemed by the plotters as propitious for military intervention. These 
triggering events may be classified into two types: (a) genuine events 
that were brought about by socio-political and historical developments, 
such as labor and peasant unrest, widespread poverty and economic 
hardships, massive discontent resulting from years of authoritarian 
rule; and (b) simulated events that could be created or provoked in order 
to effect the tense and unstable atmosphere necessary for a coup. A good 
example of the second type is political assassination, which the brutal 
lulling of Rolando Olalia could have been. 

It is possible that if a crisis does not exist, coup plotters could find a 
way to bring it about. With the effective use of media, they can exploit 
civilian and military complaints against the government to build a 
favorable political climate for a coup d'etat. There are always popular 
issues against the administration that can be cultivated. Moreover, they 
can and have taken advantage of the President's physical absence from 
fa capital. It is after all in critical periods that the government's ability 
to respond quickly and decisively is put to the test. On this depends its 
Political survival. 

Looking at the pre-coup environments of the seven cases, we find 
similar circumstances that support the idea of coup attempts being 
winched under a particular political climate. The triggering events of 
™ Past coups have included periods of division among the people, 
as during elections and plebiscites; nationwide protests like the 
w *famgBayan; massive student demonstrations; constant labor strikes; 



204 



extensive consumer disaffection with rising prices of commodities; 
strong public reactions against increases in oil prices or transportation 
fares; regular bombings and other terroristic activities; highly publicized 
cases of graft and corruption in government; widespread criminal law- 
lessness; and others. It is under such a climate that the governments 
attention is necessarily divided, while the public is generally unorganized 
and confused. There is another reason for creating an environment 
where the citizens are afraid, insecure or disgusted with the authorities, 
and that is, people would then tend to be more susceptible to the idea of 
drastic military action, such as the imposition of martial law or,the 
establishment of a military junta. 

Another common denominator among the seven cases was the target 
areas attacked by the coup plotters. In all the coup attempts, the focus 
of hostilities and confrontation was Metro Manila because it is the seat 
of the national government which the rebels are trying to overthrow. The 
inclusion as targets of the regions around the capital, such as Central 
Luzon, Southern Tagalog, and Bicol, seemed to have the dual purpose of 
providing easy access for rebel reinforcements to Manila from key units 
where the RAM-HF had built support, or allowing the rebels to intercept 
military reinforcements thereby crippling the government's capacity to 
respond to the emergency in Manila. During the August 1987 attempt, 
the rebels also attacked and/or occupied civilian and military targets 
outside of Luzon (i.e., Cebu, and to a lesser extent, Bohol and Negros 
Oriental). This could be, on one hand, simply because of rebel supporters 
coming from those areas or, on the other hand, it could be indicative of 
the coup plotters' endeavor to widen their sphere of influence and give 
the impression of their movement being national in scope. 

The specific target areas within Metro Manila hardly varied with 
each coup attempt. The rebels invariably attacked or planned to seize 
Malacanang to capture the President; the military camps, for logistics 
and communications; the media stations, to gain public support; and 
Villamor Air Base or the airports, with the intention of controlling air 
power and facilitating the rapid airlift of rebel reinforcements from the 
provinces to Manila. The takeover of the Manila Hotel in 1986 and 
Camelot Hotel in 1987 could be considered as exceptions to the rule. 

The grievances and demands expressed by the coup plotters were 
basically similar in all the attempts. There were complaints internal to 
the military, such as inadequate pay and benefits; insufficient logistical 
services and supplies to soldiers in the field; favoritism in promotions 
and assignments; and discriminatory treatment, in the case of Marcos 
loyalists. Curiously enough, many of these were the same onesraisedty 



CHAPTER IV 205 



the RAM against Marcos in 1985. The complaints directed against the 
government, on the other hand, included the consistent issue of graft and 
corruption and the perceived "soft-approach" of the President in her 
counter-insurgency policy, which the rebels implied was connected with 
the presence of so-called "left-leaning" officials in her Cabinet and their 
alleged anti-military biases. 

While the grievances openly declared by the rebels may be valid, and 
the idealistic aspirations for good government of some younger rebel 
officers may be genuine, it is nevertheless important to delve into the 
possible unstated intentions of the key coup plotters. Most of the leaders 
of the loyalist attempts were senior military officers who had served 
under the Marcos regime. In the Manila Hotel incident, they were 
directly supported by former officials of the past administration. While 
Marcos was alive, they seemed to have a binding commitment to work for 
his return. However, with his death, this unifying factor has been 
removed and the loyalist cause appears to have gradually lost vigor. The 
identified loyalist leaders who have gone underground have little choice 
but to give up, or to support other destabilizing activities in the hope of 
succeeding and regaining power, even if it is shared with the RAM-HF. 

On the other hand, a closer look at the principal coup plotters of the 
other attempts would lead us to the RAM. Although the RAM was 
originally organized to work for reforms within the military, its existence 
was related to the political survival and physical safety of then Defense 
Minister Enrile, by his own account. 161 Thus, it becomes unavoidable for 
his name to be linked with any activities that former RAM officers, led 
by Honasan, undertake. Though some new personalities have surfaced 
as coup participants in the investigations of succeeding coups, the same 
names associated with the February 1986 events keep reappearing. 
Then, as in the succeeding RAM-HF attempts, their ultimate goal 
seemed to be the overthrow of the government and the creation of a 
miutary junta, presumably composed of people of their choice. This 
appears evident in the February and November 1986 attempts, as well 
as in the August 1987 coup plot. In all the seven cases taken up here, no 
clear post-coup political and economic program has ever been presented 
to the public; instead, it appears that this would depend on who sat in 
ftejunta. 

According to Secretary Ramos, the first direct involvement of the 
™ps of the Scout Rangers was during the 28 August 1987 attempt. 
However, according to retired BGen Almonte, a key RAM officer in the 
eai *ly years of the organization, Honasan had recruited battalion 
commanders from the FSRR, mostly majors then, for the February 1986

coup plot 162 This is not surprising as Scout Rangers, like the Marines, 
are considered among the best traine d and disciplined members of the 
AFP. They are mobile units of the Armed Forces, continuously operating 
as a team and assigned from one place to another to influence any given 
military situation. Moreover, and more importantly perhaps, the Scout 
Rangers are given such rigorous, specialized training that they later 
develop strong camaraderie and loyalty towards each other — valuable 
traits in a coup attempt. The FSRR no longer exists today. Its members 
were absorbed by other units of the AFP after their extensive participation 
in the December 1989 coup. 

Another source of recruitment in the past coup attempts was from 
the Guardians organization, a military fraternity composed mostly of 
enlisted personnel said to extend to about 70 percent of the AFP. 168 
There are actually two related groups existing: the Guardians Brother- 
hood, Inc (GBI), which has its roots in the Diablo Squad, allegedly formed 
in the early 1980s; and the Guardians Centre Foundation, Inc (GCFI), 
founded in 1986 with Honasan as the lead signatory in its Articles of 
Incorporation. There was said tobe considerable Guardians participation 
in all the past coup attempts, particularly in the February and July 1986 
coups, as well as in the January and April 1987 ones. It was reported that 
the GBI officially disowned any connection with Honasan after the 
August 1987 attempt. 164 

The bond that unites the coup participants thus appears to be 
primarily based on personal loyalties, friendships, and other personal 
ties, rather than on shared political beliefs, principles, and a vision ofthe 
future. It is true that for many coup participants, the rallying call 
seemed to be anti-communism but the network of RAM-HF recruitment 
still frequently relied on personal relations. 

The general reactions of the government to the past coup attempts 
have included a revamp of the Cabinet, including the ouster of some of 
its liberal members due to the rebels' demands; the announcement of 
reform measures; and the conduct of an investigation on the coup 
attempt (e.g., Bengzon Committee, Cabinet Crisis Committee, Vice 
President Laurel's informal survey of military camps). An immediate 
response has been the increase in budget for the military (e.g., after the 
1987 coup attempts, the Senate restored 1*373 million out of the ^00 
million proposed cut in the DND's ¥ 23 billion budget). There were also 
measures taken to promote the soldiers' welfare by expediting action 
aimed at increasing their material benefits. 



CHAPTER rv 207 



The military, for its part, has also conducted investigations on the 
coups but there appears to be uneven inquiry and reporting into the 
seven cases. Official military reports were only available on the January, 
April, and August 1987 attempts. The executive department also 
seemed to have been left out in the military's pre-coup reporting, as 
evidenced by Malacanang^s lack of information and preparation in 
several of the past attempts. The public, on the other hand, has reacted 
to the coups by giving unprecedented attention and interest in military 
affairs. Academic studies and public fora dealing with the topic have also 
increased. Even religious groups have now focused on the Armed Forces 
as subject of prayer rallies and pastoral letters. Moreover, there has 
been heightened media coverage on the military since the advent ofthe 
iudeta. The importance of mass media, especially radio, in informing 
people ofwhat was happening during the coups cannotbe overemphasized. 
However, it has also been in this environment that the release of 
misinformation and disinformation about the coups has occurred. For 
instance, much speculation and even inaccurate information coming 
from foreign media were repeated in the Philippines through the wire 
services during some of the past attempts. 166 On the other hand, plotters 
have admittedly also manipulated the media with half truths and false 
leakages" for their own purposes. 166 

In retrospect, the coup plotters employed certain strategies that 
manifest careful planning and perseverance in their implementation. 
In recruitment, for example, the rebels generally harnessed the active 
participation of strategically situated, middle-level troop commanders. 
For the August 1987 coup, it is said that their major effort was directed 
at field commanders who controlled significant units in the AFP, like 
battalion commanders of the Army, provincial commanders of the PC, 
some squadron commanders of the PAF, and maybe some unit 
commanders of the Navy. The officers who command infantry or tank 
battalions stationed in or near Manila, as well as those who have control 
over helicopter gunships and other aircraft within striking distance of 
jhe seat of power, are crucial for a coup's success. It was easy for the 
KAM-HF to recruit because most ofthe commanders were of their age 
group and from the PMA, either former classmates or contemporaries at 
»e PMA of the Honasan group. This was in contrast to the February 
!986 plot where, outside of the RAM members, recruitment went up 
vertically to the major unit commanders with the rank of brigadier 
general. I n 1987, the RAM-HF worked on the "horizontal cut" at 
battalion level and below, as MGenMontano pointed out. 167 The plotters 
^dermined tn e chain of command by likewise getting the loyalty of 
c °inpany commanders. They talked to captains and lieutenants who 
a «y handle the troops. 



208 



Former CSAFP and now DND Secretary Ramos disclosed that rebel 
recruitment for the August 1987 coup was done among junior officers, 
sometimes even involving key non-commissioned officers, under the 
guise of school reunions, training sessions, dialogues, and ordinary get- 
togethers 168 For the August attempt, it was observed that Honasan, 
then head of the Special Operations School (SOS) of the Arm/sTraining 
Command in Fort Magsaysay, Nueva Ecija, trained various classes of 
Scout Rangers but did not graduate them. About five or six classes were 
accumulated at one period, and instead of being graduated normally one 
class after the other, they were extended at the school and later 
mobilized for the coup. 169 

To begin with, the reassignments of Honasan at the SOS and 
Kapunan at the PMA after the November 1986 coup attempt appear to 
have been used to maximum advantage by the coup plotters. These are 
precisely the places where they could considerably influence the younger 
soldiers and recruit them for coup or terrorist activities. Between a 
group that had a single-minded purpose of taking power, regardless of 
means, and the Ramos/de Villa group which was sincerely workingfor 
genuine reconciliation, the former had a clear edge in planning and 
conspiring. There are lessons to be learned from these past coups for 
purposes of handling the aftermath of the December 1989 coup. These 
will be discussed in Chapter VII.

(1) Retired Col Guillermo G. Cunanan, who was then assigned to the * 
MND, places the date of RAM's founding as 1982, see "Open Letter 
to Gringo," Philippine Star, 7 September 1987, pp. 1 and 10. 
Journalist and author Cecilio T. Arillo gives a more exact date of 
23 July 1982 in Breakaway: The Inside Storv of the Four-Dav 
Revolution in the Philippines. February 22-25. 1986 (Manila: CTA 
and Associates, May 1986), p. 166. On the other hand, retired 
BGen Jose Almonte, Commissioner of the Economic Intelligence 
and Investigation Bureau and RAM member, says the idea for 
RAM was crystallized in 1985, although discussions had been 
going on long before that [from his Sworn Testimony before the 
Fact-Finding Commission (FFC), 4 January 1990]. American 
writer and Political Science Professor Alfred W. McCoy mentions 
two conflicting dates of "late 1984" and "early 1985" as RAM's 
founding dates in two separate articles in "RAM Boys Series," 

Philippine Daily Inquirer. February 1990, p. 3 and p. 4.

(13) Tarrazona was promoted to the rank of colonel by President \ 
Aquino. It appears, however, that by virtue of a recommendation i 
of a panel that he be severely punished under Article 105 of the \ 
Articles of War for his alleged involvement in the 28 August 1987 | 
coup attempt, for which in time he was reprimanded, the CSAPP 
recommended to the President that his name be stricken off lie 
list of officers for promotion submitted to Congress for confir- 
mation. This recommendation was favorably acted upon by the 
President. Tarrazona, nevertheless, continues to wear the insignia 
of a colonel because he filed a motion for reconsideration which, 
according to him, is still pending.

THE FAILED DECEMBER 1989 COUP: PRE-COUP 
EVENTS AND BATTLE ZONE NARRATIVES 



A, Overview 

Thischapter deals with the events associated with thefailedDecember 
1989 coup attempt in great detail. This overview gives the reader the 
broad picture, like a road map in a manner of speaking. The illustrations 
on page 259 show the battle sites during the December 1989 coup. The 
Commission hopes this will help him link one event with the others 
which occurred in different places at the same time. 

AA. Strategy and Planning of the Coup dTEtat 

The basic assumption behind the launching of a coup is that a 
concerted attack conducted with speed, surprise, and surgical precision 
against key facilities of a government in crisis, actual or perceived, will 
cause its immediate collapse. Such a strategy, however, calls for the 
total commitment of all the coup forces at one time. 

As pointed out in Chapter I, in a coup there is no opportunity to 
change strategy and tactics, replace weapons and men, or correct errors 
and omissions. The planning stage of a coup is thus of crucial importance. 
^ strategy, the propaganda, the recruitment, the logistics, and every 
move necessary for the success of the coup must be set beforehand, 

AA Pre-Coup Activities 

The Commission has, therefore, included in this chapter a report on 
Pre-coup activities (both the rebels' and the government's) as gathered 
ro ^h direct testimonies, sworn statements, affidavits, exhibits, and 
intelligence reports. These sources indicate that by at least the first 
garter of 1989, an extensive conspiracy amongst the coup plotters was 
to motion. 



222 



The major players, ex-Lt Col Gregorio Honasan, BGen Edgardo 
Abenina, ex-BGen Jose Ma Zumel, 1 and others, met frequently with 
BGen Alejandro Galido, who was reportedly then acting as a deep 
penetration agent for Gen Renato de Villa, Chief of Staff Armed Forces 
of the Philippines (CSAFP). Galido also had meetings during this period 
with, among others, Cherry Cobarrubias, Enrique Cojuangco, and Luis 
Tabuena. An alliance between the RAM-HF (Honasan Faction) and the 
Loyalists (Zumel Group) was forged at this time. Individual efforts at 
recruitment, such as those conducted by Lt Col Tiburcio Fusilero in Cebu 
and other parts in the south, were taking place in various units of the 
Armed Forces. The activities of the government, on the other hand, 
consisted of monitoring the various moves of the conspirators and of 
taking such preventive action as was possible under the circumstances. 

A^J. Execution of the Coup 

A«3.a. 29 November - Tagaytay Incident 

The failed December 1989 coup began inauspiciously on 29 November 
1989, when a Scout Ranger team prematurely destroyed the AFP 
communications station in Tagaytay. This mission was not supposed to 
take place until 30 November, since it was meant to signal D-Day for the 
1 December coup. 

Nonetheless, despite this false start, rebel ground and air forces 
commenced hostilities against their pre-chosen targets almost simul- 
taneously in the late evening of 30 November and in the very early 
morning of 1 December. These targets, picked in accordance with the 
aforementioned strategic principles, were: Fort Bonifacio, Villamor Air 
base (VAB) together with the Domestic and International Airports, 
nSTm^ST ' Channels 2 *> Sangley Point, Mactan Air Base 
(MAB), Malacailang, and North and South Harbors. The Makati business 
district appears to have been outside the initial plan. 

A^.b. 30 November and 1 December - Fort Bonifacio and 
Villamor Air Base F 

At about the same time that two rebel Marine companies, supported 
by three LVTs and two V-150s, launched an attack on VAB, three 
fS££**a J SC0Ut ***** Regiment (FSRR) occupied the 

PhSw a 1 S^ 0 * ca P turin g the Commanding General of the 
PhilippineArmy(CGPA^ 

ot *ort Bonifacio without encountering any significant resistance. 



CHAPTER V 223 



However, the rebels were unable to use the armor of the Light Armor 
Brigade (LABde), nor the artillery pieces of the Philippine Army light 
Armor Regiment (PALAR), whose range is capable of reaching Camp 
Aguinaldo and Malacafiang, because these units remained loyal to the 
government. 

Meanwhile, rebel Marines succeeded in entering VAB, neutralizing 
the 205th Helicopter Wing (205 HW) and its assets, sealing off the 
Commanding General of the Philippine Air Force (CG PAF) on the third 
floor of his HQ, damaging the 205 HW HQ Building, and the Bachelor 
Officers' Quarters, as well as disabling the helicopters and taking over 
the entire base. 



A3.c. 1 December 



Domestic and International Airports 

At the Manila Domestic Airport, gunfire erupted early in the morning 
as Philippine Air Force Security Command (PAFSECOM) soldiers 
engaged rebel troops in defending the airport terminal. However, 
shortly after 5:00 a.m., the PAFSECOM personnel at the Domestic 
Airport were overpowered. A rebel force of about 100 men took over the 
Baggage Area near Terminal No. 2. Another group led by ex-Maj Lyle 
Tugbang and Maj Jose Gamos, composed mainly of civilians and 
Guardians, occupied the main Terminal Building where defending 
PAFSECOM personnel were herded into a room inside the Terminal 
Building. 

At the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), a PAFSECOM 
Battle Staff was established which ordered Runways 06-24 and 13-31 
wmcaded with firetrucks and baggage containers to prevent their use. 
However, rebel forces made no attempt to capture it. By 2:30 p.m., rebel 
orees led by Gamos and Tugbang left the Domestic Airport and moved 
w the vicinity of Quirino Avenue and Coastal Road. 

Coastal Rood 

So ^ Gam0S ' Tugbang " led rebel tro °P s were blocked by a unit of the 
viri ff eCt0r Capital Command (CAPCOM) who were deployed at the 
Ho V °l Coastal Road corner MIA Road - A firefight ensued when the 
thfeMf 0FCe refused to J° in the rebels. At around 5:00 p.m. , troops from 
^Metropolitan Police Field Force (MPFF) arrived to assist the blocking 
e » causing the group of Gamos-Tugbang to withdraw shortly after. 



224 



Camp Aguinaldo 

At Camp Aguinaldo, the AFP Logistics Command (LOGCOM) under 
Commo Domingo Calajate declared their open support for the rebels at 
about 8:00 a.m., occupying the Joint Operations Center (JOC) Building 
by force. The LOGCOM rebels backed off, however, and returned to their 
compound when confronted by BGen Lisandro Abadia, AFP Deputy 
Chief of Staff for Operations, who was supported by the 72nd Infantry 
Battalion (72 IB) under Lt Col Alejandro Lasan. Thereafter, the 2nd 
Infantry Division (2 ID) under the command of BGen Javier Carbonell, 
supported by five armor vehicles, launched an attack against LOGCOM. 
After a firefight, LOGCOM surrendered. 

The following reinforcements arrived to defend Camp Aguinaldo: 

1. 72 IB at 7:40 a.m.; 

2. 701st Infantry Brigade (701 Bde) of 7 ID at 8:10 a.m., along 
with other elements of the 72 IB, a total of 260 men; 

3. 2 ID at 11:30 a.m., a strength of 826 men; 

4. AFP Training Command (TRACOM) at 11:46 a.m., a strength of 
345 men; 

5. RECOM 3 at 5:27 p.m.; 

6. 1st Marine Brigade (1 MBde) of NCRDC at 7:05 p.m.; and 

7. On the following morning at 3:30 a.m., the 202 Bde and the 203 
Bde. 

ABS-CBN and PTV-4 

Before dawn, some of the rebel Marines, who took over VAB, 
proceeded to ABS-CBN and PTV-4 compounds in Quezon City and easily 
occupied the government television station PTV-4, since the security 
platoon assigned there withdrew in the face of superior forces. At around 
2:00 p.m., a group of civilians, led by Rafael Recto, arrived and entered 
the PTV-4 premises ostensibly to look for his daughter Plinky who works 
at ABS-CBN. However, Recto was overheard to say that he was there to 
attend a press conference. Lito Gorospe, who was inside the ABS-CBN 
area at that time, allegedly intended to air some messages, but since the 
management of ABS-CBN and PTV-4 had disabled the transmitters, 
none of these events took place. 



CHAPTER V 225 



Mactan Air Base 



BGen Jose Comendador, the Commander of the 2nd Air Division, 
took parallel action in MAB by assuming control of the base, and while 
initially not declaring his position, he later took the rebel side. Army 
troops from Mindanao composed of elements from the 23 IB and 30 IB 
joined Comendador later that day, and secured MAB for the rebels. 

Sangley Point 

With the use of minimal force, the rebels took control of Sangley 
Point At 12:30 a.m., two 6 x 6 trucks loaded with rebel soldiers in full 
battle gear disarmed the guards manning the main gate. The rebels 
then successively took over the flight line and the government air assets, 
then isolated the Wing Commander of the 15th Strike Wing (15 SW) 
in his HQ. The same action was taking place on the naval side of the base. 
The rebels equally restricted the Commander of the Philippine Fleet to 
his HQ, after failing to convince him to join them, and then proceeded to 
occupy several units of the Philippine Fleet Headquarters. 

However, by around 1:00 p.m., the rebel air assets were destroyed by 
the government F-5s. By mid-afternoon, combined elements of Cavite, 
Laguna, and Batangas Philippine Constabulary/Integrated National 
Police(PC!/INP) Commands launched an attack which eventually resulted 
in the retaking of Sangley. Also, the two rebel battalions of the 68 IB and 
24 IB which had earlier arrived from Bataan aboard a fishing vessel 
were permitted to return to their home base. Thus, by early evening of 
1 December, Sangley Point was back in government hands. 

Malacanang and Sta Mesa 

At around 6:25 a.m., three T-28s (Tora-Tora), manned by rebel pilots 
tod assisted by a British Norman Islander acting as a forward air 
controller, took off from Sangley Air Base. They conducted bombing and 
strafing runs over the Malacanang complex. Although two F-5 fighter 
MafrornBasa Air Base were scrambled to intercept the Tora-Toras, no 
^gfight occurred. 

Meanwhile, rebel soldiers mostly in civilian clothes, blocked certain 
approaches leading to Malacafiang to prevent it from being reinforced. 
,p 0 * ever > a Task Force, composed of the Presidential Security Group 
6rfi« ^ Manila police personnel, augmented by seven armor infantry 
^ong vehicles, assaulted rebel positions in and around the Sta Mesa 



226 



district At about 7:00 p.m., this area was cleared of rebel soldiers by 



the Task Force 

North and South Harbors 



t?^ I ™' m " RAM - HP forces some Customs personnel, led by 
ex-Lt Col Billy Bibit, had control of the main entrances and exits of the 
North and South Harbors, and occupied key buildings in both areas. 

The Zaragoza Gate (Gate 1) and Moriones Gate (Gate 2) of North 
Harbor were barricaded with container vans and cargo trucks by heavily 
armed rebels. The same thinghappened at Gate 3 of the South Harbor. 
Personnel at the Coast Guard Station located at the North Harbor were 
disarmed, and the Philippine Port Authority (PPA) office there wai 
made the headquarters of the rebels. At the South Harbor, the rebels 
occupied the Customs Police Station and raided the Enforcement and 
Security Services (ESS) HQ, while disarming the personnel on duty, and 
carting away guns and goods of various sorts. 

r, r H °eT! er ' in the late ^"^on. RAM-HF soldiers around the PPA

Scout Rangers occurred at this point but when it failed, most of the rebel 
forces moved out of Fort Bonifacio for the Makati business district. 

Upon reaching Makati, the rebel Scout Rangers occupied some 22 
high-rise buildings in the Ayala business area. Snipers were deployed 
at the rooftops of strategically located buildings, supported by maneu- 
vering forces on the ground. In response, the government organized a 
Task Force Makati, composed initially of elements from CAPCOM and 
the PC from Laguna and Batangas, to block off escape routes and 
eventually to retake Makati. 

At this time and for some days thereafter, intermittent en-counters 
took place and sniper shots were exchanged between the rebels and 
government forces. 

ABS-CBN and PTV-4 

Government forces attacked in the early morning, and after a two- 
hour resistance, rebel soldiers withdrew from the PTV-4 station and 
joined their comrades near Camp Aguinaldo. 

Camp Aguinaldo and BGen Blando 

The rebel Marine forces, which came from VAB and PTV-4, utilizing 
LVTs and V-150s, commenced their attack on Camp Aguinaldo, 
alternating between Gates 1, 2, and 3. However, government troops held 
on to their defensive positions. Meanwhile, the rebels situated by the 
Mormon Church at White Plains were being subjected to frequent air 
strikes. No significant inroads were made by the rebels on this day. 

In the morning, BGen Marcelo Blando's forces, composed of two 
infantry battalions of the 7 ID plus one Scout Ranger company from Fort 
Magsaysay, Palayan City, Nueva Ecija, reached Metro Manila and, 
instead of proceeding to Camp Aguinaldo, positioned themselves at the 
Greenhills Commercial Center in front of Unimart. After pretending all 
the while to be on the government side, Blando finally declared himself 
for the rebels. Fortunately, his two infantry battalions refused to commit 
bright andto fightthe government forces in Camp Aguinaldo, eventually 
causing Blando to surrender the following day, 3 December. However, 
the company of Scout Rangers detached themselves and attacked Camp 
^inaldo through Gate 4. 



228 



Mactan Air Base 

The pilots in MAB, under the leadership of Lt Col Antonio Anciano, 
Commander, 208th Tactical Helicopter Squadron, escaped from the base 
and proceeded to the Visayas Command (VISCOM) HQ in Cebu City. 
Thus, BGen Comendador was left with airplanes but no pilots to fly 
them. Both BGen Renato Palma, Commander VISCOM, and BGen 
Cesar Go contacted Comendador and tried to convince him to give up, 
The latter refused to surrender, and threatened that should government 
forces attack Mactan, he would blow up the aircrafts in the base, 
particularly the two 747s belonging to Philippine Airlines (PAL). 

A*3.e. 3 December - Camp Aguinaldo 

From 1:30 a.m. to 6:00 a.m., the battle of Camp Aguinaldo raged 
in earnest. 

Rebel forces, coming from the White Plains area, initiated combined 
artillery and mortar attacks. Backed by Marine LVTs and other armor 
vehicles, ground assaults were launched in the northern vicinity (Gate 

1 of Camp Aguinaldo and Main Gate of LOGCOM), as well as the eastern 
vicinity (LOGCOM perimeter). But loyal troops repulsed the attacks 
using artillery, mortar, and recoilless rifles, which disabled the enemy's 
armor. A rebel V-150 was destroyed, while an LVT was totally burned 
and partially blocked Gate 1. 

Meanwhile, some rebel Marines led by Maj Cesar de la Pefla 
infiltrated Camp Aguinaldo but government defenders were able to 
isolate them at the General Headquarters (GHQ) Dispensary and St 
Ignatius Chapel. After a brief firefight, the rebels surrendered. 

Later, at about 6:30 a.m., the rest of the attacking rebel forces under 
Lt Col Romelino Gojo PN, Operations Officer, Philippine Marines, 
withdrew towards White Plains but were subjected to continuous air 
strikes by PAF F-5 jets and Sikorsky helicopter gunships. Enemy forces 
then dispersed and finally withdrew from the camp's vicinity. At 7:00 
a.m., rebel remnants and their armor located near the Mormon Church 
at Katipunan Avenue were bombed by government jets. Elements of the 

2 ID then cleared the area of all rebel resistance and secured it against 
possible counter-attacks. 



CHAPTER V 229 



AJJi. 4 to 9 December - Makati and Mactan Air Base 

In Makati and Mactan, the period between 4 to 9 December was 
spent with both sides intermittently threatening, posturing, fighting 
or negotiating. Finally, by 2:30 a.m. of 6 December as a result of the 
negotiations led by BGen Arturo Enrile, Superintendent of the Philippine 
Military Academy (PMA), with the rebels, a ceasefire was declared, 
culminating later in the morning in the departure of foreign tourists and 
apartment dwellers from the rebel-occupied Makati area. On 7 December, 
at around 9:00 a.m., the rebels ended their occupation of the commercial 
district of Makati and marched back to their barracks at Fort Bonifacio. 
Mactan followed suit on 9 December when the rebels, headed by BGen 
Comendador, formally surrendered to BGen Palma in the middle of 
Mandaue Bridge. 

A3.g. 1 to 2 December - Air Strikes

A^Ji, 1 to 7 December - Other Hostile Acts In the Provinces 

* While Metro Manila was under seige by various rebel forces, the 
following incidents took place in Regions I, II, IV, V, VI, X, and XL 

1 December 

1. Twelve soldiers in the Cordillera region entered a local radio 
station and insisted in broadcasting their support for the rebels. 

2. Rebel Scout Rangers took over Legaspi City Domestic Airport. 
However, after lengthy negotiations, they ended their occupation 
of the airport and were escorted back to Camp Bagong Ibalon. 

3. Elements of 253rd PC Company left Sorsogon in two buses for 
Manila but were stopped in Camarines Norte where the Pro- 
vincial Commander convinced them to return to Camp Escudero, 
Sorsogon. 

4. Two hundred men from 339th PC Company gathered at Bacolod 
Airport waiting for a PAF C- 130 to fly them to Manila. When the 
airplane did not arrive and subsequent efforts to use a shipping 
vessel at a nearby wharf failed, they were persuaded by the PC 
Provincial Commander of Negros Occidental to return to their 
camp. 

5 - Lt Emil Ong, Team Leader, 7th Riverine Assault Company, 
wrote BGen Raymundo Jarque, Commander Negros Island 
Command, offering to resign because he was disappointed with 
the AFP. Later, Ong with four men from his company attempted 
to use the PuJupandan Port but was refused entrance by the 
. se curity guard at the gate. 

6 A ' 
' £/ r ° Up of J unior Pilots at Fernando Air Base wanted to fly an 
&F-260 aircraft and conduct persuasion flights over Manila in 
support of the coup. Col Hector Tarrazona, Director for Opera- 
tes, 100th TrainingWing, was instructed by Wing Commander 
Lo1 Felipe Abando to persuade the pilots not to do so. While the 



232 



meeting was going on, Col Abando ordered the maintenance 
officer of the 443rd Field Depot and Maintenance Squadron to 
disable the aircrafts. 

7. Cagayan Gov Rodolfo Aguinaldo went on the air over DZRH in 
the morning, declaring support for the coup. Five hundred of his 
men attempted to reach Manila but were blocked in Nueva Ecya, 

» 

2 December 

1. An officer of the HQ Service Company, PC TRACOM, at Silang, 

Cavite displayed a banner expressing support for the RAM-HP. 

2. Lt Col Teodorico Viduya, Davao del Norte PC/INP Provincial 
Commander, with a group of 30 officers sought guidance frfcm 
BGen Mariano Baccay, Jr, RECOM 11 Commander. They 
wanted to issue a manifesto in favor of the rebels. He dissuaded 
them from doing so; but an unsigned manifesto was circulated 
just the same. 

3 December 

1. Elements of the 56 IB based in Palayan City, Nueva Ecija left for 
Manila but were stopped in Pampanga. 

2. Before an assembly of officers and men of PC TRACOM, 
Superintendent Col Renato Motus issued a manifesto expressing 
support for the rebel cause. 

3. Capt Gregory Ramos, Commanding Officer (CO), Alpha Coy, 
2nd Light Armor Battalion (2 LAB) LABde, with 20 of his men 
and five armor vehicles left his station at Tuburan, Mawab, 
Davao del Norte to secure the Davao City Airport in a show of 
sympathy for the rebel cause. They encountered a roadblock at 
Barangay Sasa, Davao City. They were eventually brought to 
BGen Baccay by Col Danilo Olay, and after a lengthy dialogue, 
Capt Ramos and his men returned to their camp. 

4. Six truckloads of rebel soldiers from 30 IB led by Lt Generoso 
Bolina boarded MV Nasipit Princess in Nasipit, Agusan del 
Norte bound for Cebu. However, the vessel was unable to depart 
due to the absence of the ship's captain. 



CHAPTER V 233 



7 December 



forty officers of the 4 ID at Camp Evangelista, Cagayan de Oro, led 
by Lt Col Reynaldo Rivera, sought a meeting with their Commanding 
General to air their grievances, among which seems to have been their 
objection to the participation of the US Phantom jets. However, they 
were made to resign before their Commanding General would dialogue 
with them. It appears that their resignations were not accepted. 

With the foregoing overview as a background, a detailed narrative 
of significant pre-coup events and of each battle zone follows. 

B, Pre-Coup Events 

B.l. Activities of Major Coup Plotters 

The conspiracy and planning which took place prior to the coup is 
best unraveled by recounting the activities, as gathered by the Commis- 
sion, of some of the major coup plotters and their supporters and sympa- 
thizers. Some of their activities were made public for the first time in the 
now famous "Galido Expose" which disclosed the alliance between the 
forces of Honasan and Zumel through the efforts of Abenina, as well as 
the role which the military coup plotters wanted to give some civilian 
political leaders of the opposition. 

B.l.a. Honasan, Abenina, Zumel 

Haying his role as a "deep penetration agent" for the CSAFP, 2 BGen 
Alejandro Galido, 3 CG Southern Luzon Command (SOLCOM), instructed 
hlssecunt y of ficer, Capt Oscarlito Mapalo, to find a way to get in touch 
RRP a ^ e , group of H onasan. Honasan escaped from detention on board 
^Andres Bonifacio while it anchored ofFManila Bay on 2 April 1988. 4 

Initially, Mapalo could not establish the desired contact, despite his 
Jtting in touch with his former classmates, Capt Ed Oban and LtSG 
M e * pma. However, after meeting Lt Col Marcelino Malajacan, 

apalo was able to attend a meeting somewhere in Cavalier's Village, 
Lt PiD RlZal * This meetin g was attended by Col Anselmo Avenido, 

Ul Rodolfo Tor, Lt Col Malajacan, ex-Lt Col Billy Bibit, Cmdr 

occasi Patin °' ° therS wh ° Ma P al ° could not identif V- 0n this 
Galid 00 ' * rran S ements w ere discussed for a future meeting between 
ao and Abenina. Also, Mapalo was apprised of the objective of the 
ement whicn was purportedly for reform and to establish a civilian- 



234 



military junta to consist of Abenina, Zumel, Honasan, and Galido (if he 
joined the movement), together with some civilians who are non- 
traditional politicians. 5 

In January 1989, Enrique "Henry" Cojuangco, younger brother of 
Eduardo "Danding* Cojuangco, Jr, picked up Galido in Greenhills, 
Mandaluyong, Metro Manila, and brought the latter to a parking place 
in the Makati Commercial Center where Galido met Honasan in a van. 
They (Galido and Honasan) talked while the van cruised along the South 
Expressway. Honasan asked Galido's support for a planned destabi- 
lization to be launched in March 1989. 6 Later, Galido confided to BGen 
Raul Aquino, CG 2 ID, the fact of the meeting without disclosing its 
subject matter. Galido also revealed that during the August 198? failed 
coup attempt, he had an overseas phone conversation with ex-President 
Marcos, and kept the latter informed about the progress of the attempt 7 

Meanwhile, on 5 June 1989, the office of the AFP Deputy Chief of 
Staff for Intelligence (J2) received information on an alliance forged 
between the Zumel and Honasan groups for a destabilization attemptto 
be staged during the first or second week of June 1989. 

In July 1989, Galido had a meeting at the Manila Garden Hotel, 
Makati, Metro Manila — arranged by one Cesar Lopez — with a certain 
Harold Magleo (or Maglio, as in some news reports), who claimed he 
was a colonel with the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). 8 Magleo 
informed Galido that the DIA favors the overthrow of President Corazon 
C. Aquino and the return of the Marcoses to the Philippines. According 
to Col Juan Mamorno, Chief of Staff and Operations Officer SOLCOM, 
Galido commented after the meeting that he doubted that Magleo was 
a colonel because he did not behave in a military manner. 9 

In a press statement issued on 3 April 1990, the US Embassy in 
Manila confirmed that Magleo met Galido once, sometime in April 1989 
(not July 1989 as Mapalo testified), but denied that Magleo was ever a 
colonel in the US Air Force or that he was in any way connected with the 
DIA. The Embassy also said Magleo is employed at the Norton Air Base 
in California and was vacationing in the Philippines as a private 
individual. 10 

On 2 August 1989, Galido, Abenina, and Malajacan met at a house 
in Kamuning, Quezon City. 11 Abenina tried to convince Galido to join 
the group planning the coup 12 and suggested that destabilization activities 
be undertaken, citing Malacanang and VAB as targets, and President 



CHAPTER V 235 



Aquino, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, and Gen de Villa as persons to 
be assassinated. 18 

Abenina also gave Galido a series of documents regarding the 
creation of a new Government Council to be composed of military 
officers, namely, BGens Abenina, Artemio Tadiar, and Zumel, as well as 
Honasan, and three unnamed civilians. Abenina then tried to convince 
Galido that he should be the seventh man in the Council, in lieu of 
Honasan who was viewed as "so junior*. 14 In his testimony before the 
Commission, BGen Tadiar, Deputy Commander, Subic Naval Base 
Command (SUBCOM), denied any knowledge about his proposed 
membership in the Council. 15 

In the same meeting, Abenina briefed Galido on the military officers 
joining the coup, namely: Col Avenido, Secretary, Head-quarters, 
Philippine Constabulary StafT; Lt Col Gojo, Cmdr Patino of SUBCOM, 
reportedly representing BGen Tadiar; Col Mamorno, Maj Artemio 
Gamayo of 16 IB in Magdalena, Laguna; Lt Col Renato Jamora of 42 IB 
in Catamayan, Quezon; Lt Col Ramon Garcia in Pamplona, Camarines 
Sur; Col Victor Mayo of 49 IB; and Col Edgardo Espinosa PN (M). 
Abenina further claims that BGen Blando, CG 7 ID, and BGen Eduardo 
Cabanlig, Commandant, Philippine Marines (PMAR), were supporters 
of the planned coup. 16 It is possible that these officers mentioned were 
not necessarily supporters of the coup, but dropping names of "credible" 
officers is a classic strategy in planning for a coup, as mentioned in 
Chapter I. 

Galido asserted that, according to Abenina, the following officers 
hadbeen assigned to make destabilization tactical plans: LtCols Avenido, 
Gojo, and Malajacan, Cmdr Patino, and Col. Mamorno. 17 

i 

Abenina also informed Galido that, for the planned coup, funds and 
logistics would be provided by Cesar Lopez and Cherry Cobarrubias. 
Tadiar testified that Cobarrubias was a close friend of the Marcoses. 18 
According to Patino, she regularly dealt with the Navy, selling various 
applies. 19 Lopez's role was supposedly to extend support in terms 
of transportation. Cobarrubias, on the other hand, promised to give 
wtween f*2 million andF4 million once the final plan for execution was 
completed. She is also supposed to have relayed the promise of Imelda 
Marcos to give Galido "ten million" pesos within 24 hours after the 
^val of Mrs Marcos and her family in the Philippines. 20 



his testimony before the Commission on 15 June 1990, Luis 
ia, manager of the Manila International Airport during the 



236 



Marcos regime, confirmed that Cobarrubias is close to the Marcoses. 
She arranged his meeting with Galido at a room at the Mandarin Hotel 
on 6 September 1989; she likewise arranged for the long distance 
conversation between Galido and Imelda Marcos the day before. 

Tadiar, meanwhile, testified before the Commission that at a meeting 
with Galido in June or July 1989 21 or July or August 1989 at a house in 
Times St, Quezon City, he (Tadiar) was surprised to see Cobarrubias 
whom he last met in Malacanang in 1986. She was with a man who was 
introduced to Tadiar as one Mr Lopez. Actually, this Lopez is Cesar 
Lopez, another close associate of former President Marcos and the 
"Liaison of Marcos with the loyalist forces." 22 

In a letter received by the Commission on 10 August 1990* 
Cobarrubias is described as a coup operator or coup financier tied to the 
Zaldivia-Aguas front whose dealings link Mrs Marcos to the coup 
plotters. Diane Aguas admitted that Cobarrubias is a friend of her 
former live-in partner, who originally introduced himself to her as Kit 
Santiago. Santiago later became known as Capt Francisco de la Pefia, 
and later still, when he "died" on 5 August 1989, as Franco Sanchijo.* 
Sanchijo's "death" is surrounded by suspicious circumstances. 

Evidence obtained by the Commission further discloses that on 
29 November 1989, Cherry Cobarrubias (under the name Serafia C. 
Cobarrubias) checked in at the Philippine Village Hotel. 26 She checked 
out on 2 December 1989. 

In his sworn statement dated 19 January 1990, 26 Galido stated that 
Col Avenido, according to Abenina, was a member of the planninggroup; 
that Col Espinosa had promised to support the coup with two Marine 
battalions assigned in Bulacan; and that Lt Col Gojo would take care of 
getting all the Marines in Fort Bonifacio to join the rebel forces. Galido 
further said that he ordered Col Mamorno to join the planning group as 
his (Galido's) means to monitor the group's plans. 

On 12 August 1989, Rico Mendoza, representing himself as a close 
friend of exiled Danding Cojuangco, met Galido in the Quezon City 
residence of a certain Rafael Ayoste, a businessman from Lucena City. 
Mendoza purportedly relayed Cojuangco's wish to return to the 
Philippines and support a takeover of the government. 27 

From August to October 1989, on Galido's verbal instructions, 
Mamorno attended four meetings of a certain group. The first two of 
these meetings were heldin Manda^^^ 



CHAPTER V 237 



of a certain Medardo Pestano, reportedly an uncommissioned PMA'72 
graduate. The latter fetched Mamorno at the parking area of the Manila 
Peninsula Hotel in Makati for these meetings. Present in the first 
meeting were Avenido, Pestano, Tor and a PAF officer whose name 
Mamorno could not recall. 28 In attendance during the second meeting 
were Avenido, Pestano, Tor and one Col "Joe" Espinosa of the Philippine 
Marines (Mamorno knows Espinosa by his nickname "Joe* but was 
uncertain ifj ose* is the former's correct first name. He is sure, however, 
that Espinosa belongs to the Marines). 29 

The next two meetings were held in the residence, either in Marikina 
or Antipolo, of a certain "Tor*, introduced to Mamorno as a PC officer. On 
those meetings, Malajacan, Tor, Avenido and Pestano were present. The 
group asked Mamorno to commit SOLCOM forces for the coup ; however, 
he consistently replied that he would refer the matter to his commander. 30 

Galido further said in his affidavit that Luis Tabuena receivedf*5 
million, evidently from the Marcoses, of which T2 million would be for 
Zumel and T 3 million for Galido. It was BGen Luther Custodio who 
informed him (Galido) about the money during a family reunion on 2 
September 1989 at the residence of Rico Mendoza in San Fernando, 
Pampanga. This affair was also attended by Henry Cojuangco and Baby 
Asistio. Galido then asked Capt Mapalo to contact Cobarrubias to 
mform Tabuena that he would like to talk to him. His meeting with 
Tabuena eventually took place in a room at the Mandarin Hotel in 
Makati on 6 September. 31 

According to Tabuena, he was contacted by Cobarrubias at the 365 
Club of Hotel Intercontinental, informing him that Galido would like to 

him. It was Cobarrubias who arranged the 6 September meeting at 
we Mandarin and when he arrived there at 2:00 p.m., Cobarrubias and 
wwdo wer * already there. In the presence of Cobarrubias, Galido asked 
labuena about the delivery of the money to Zumel. Tabuena denied 
™ngknown about it, while Cobarrubias did not say anything. According 
w Tabuena, Zumel was the Military Supervisor of the Manila Inter- 
zonal Airport for two years when Tabuena was its General Manager. 32 

Se k!° c °barrubias had been at the Mandarin Hotel since 5 
Ptember. Accordingto Galido, in the eveningof said date, Cobarrubias 
j^ged a long distance call for him with Imelda Marcos who asked him 
so ft* v° hasten ^ P ,an to destabilize the government through a coup 
gttat the Marcoses could return to the Philippines and help the new 
A 6 ** rs Marcos further expressed her willingness to support 

manually, however, at that moment she was hard up. She 



238 



promised to provide support within 24 hours following her arrival in 
the Philippines. 33 

Tabuena admitted that he had known Mrs Marcos since college days 
when he played basketball and she used to watch the NCAA games. A 
year after the Marcoses left the Philippines, Mrs Marcos used to call him 
once or twice every two weeks; as a matter of fact, two weeks before he 
gave his testimony to the Commission, Mrs Marcos had called him. She 
also called him before the December coup to ask what was going on and 
also after the coup to inquire how many were killed. 

Ten days after that Mandarin Hotel meeting, he met Cobarrubias at 
the Intercontinental Hotel and confronted her: "O iyon long pala ang 
tatanunginmosaakin f eh,hindimopasinasabisaakin? n She answered 
that she did not know what Galido wanted to take up with him. Tabuena, 
however, admitted that he was of the impression that what Galido 
wanted to take up with him was secret, but that Cobarrubias knew what 
it was about. He did not confront Galido as to why the latter insinuated 
that he (Tabuena) may have misappropriated the money nor did he 
inquire as to the source of the money. When he obtained a copy of Galido's 
affidavit implicating him, it did not occur to him to communicate with 
Galido or to try to see Cobarrubias. 34 

Tabuena confirmed that Cobarrubias resides abroad and travels a 
lot to the Philippines, often passing through Honolulu where she has a 
travel agency. She told him that she visited the Marcoses in Honolulu. 
He used to see Cobarrubias at least twice a month; however, since after 
the December 1989 coup when she was implicated, he has not seen her. 

Other Meetings ofBGen Galido 

On 14 November 1989, Galido, Zumel, Abenina and Honasanmetto 
discuss a coup slated to be staged before Christmas. On the way to the 
meeting, Galido rode in a car with Abenina and Atty Homobono Adaza. 35 
Also present at the meeting were Avenido and Tor, both of whom were 
implicated in the 28 August 1987 failed coup. This meeting was allegedly 
held either in San Francisco del Monte, 36 or Tierra Pura, Tandang 
Sora 37 , both in Quezon City. 

In Camp Aguinaldo at about 2:00 p.m., 30 November, Galido received 
a note from Abenina stating that H-Hour for the coup would be at 3:00 
a.m. of 1 December, and for Galido to bring all his SOLCOM forces to 
support the rebel forces in the National Capital Region (NCR). GaHdo 
said he was annoyed at this unexpected change of date for launching** 



CHAPTER V 239 



coup, since the original date mentioned by Abenina was 8 December. 
Upon being contacted by Galido for an explanation, Abenina said that he 
was just notified of the change by Honasan and that he (Abenina) had no 
control over the matter, since RAM-HF was calling the shots. 38 

That evening, during the Command Conference called by Gen de 
Villa at Camp Aguinaldo, Galido briefed the officers on the different 
coup countersigns (white-day 1, pink-day 2, red-day 3, and again, white- 
day 4, pink-day 5, red-day 6, they had plans for six days) as disclosed to 
him by Abenina. 39 . After the Command Conference, Galido met Abenina 
somewhere in the Araneta complex in Cubao during which time Abenina 
kept urging Galido to support the coup despite the change of date and 
time, or at least to remain neutral. Galido claimed he turned down both 
propositions. 40 On the following day, Abenina telephoned Galido almost 
every hour trying to convince him to support the coup. As an inducement, 
he allegedly offered Galido the initial position of Commanding General 
ofthe Philippine Army and eventually that of Chief of StafTof the Armed 
Forces, if the coup succeeded. 41 

Other coup leaders played the following roles during this period: 
Commo Domingo Calajate at the LOGCOM; Col Alexander Noble in 
Agusan del Sur and Metro Manila; ex-Lt Col Bibit and Lt Col Victor 
Batac, in Quezon City and Holiday Inn, Manila; Lt Rasco in Quezon 
Province, and Lt Col Tiburcio Pusilero in Cebu City. 

B.l.b. Calajate 

On 26 November, after the flag ceremony in Camp Aguinaldo, a 
conference was held at the AFP LOGCOM at which all officers were 
wormed that there might be a coup sometime during the second week 
^December. Commo Calajate, Commander LOGCOM, instructed all 
officers to proceed to camp immediately once they hear about it over the 
run Accordm S to him » this information came from a conference at 
tS ° n 24 November - 42 Three days later, Calajate sent his family out 
0 heir resi dence at Camp Aguinaldo to some place outside the camp. 43 

In breach of the code of honor of an officer and a gentleman, all the 
i me , aware °f his participation and role in the unfolding coup, and 
Rowing the exact hour it would be staged, Calajate had the temerity to 
theCSA 16 CoTnmand Conference at 5:30 p.m. of November 30 called by 
^AFP on which occasion government defense plans were discussed. 



lays before the coup, Lt Col J erry Albano was a frequent visitor 



240 



of Cmdr Proceso Maligalig, Deputy Commander AFP LOGCOM. On 1 
December, Albano joined Calfgate at the LOGCOM, Camp Aguinaldo. 44 

B.I.C. Noble 

From October up to the second week of November 1989, at the latest, 
Col Noble had been going around Mindanao. He sought to establish links 
with the Mindanao Independence Movement (MIM) of Reuben Canoy. 48 

He also tried to establish links with landowners who opposed the 
Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, and who organized themselves 
into the Mindanao Freedom Movement (MFM). 

As testified to by former Bukidnon governor, Carlos Fortich, Noble 
attended conferences of the Mindanao Freedom Movement In one of 
these, which was either held in Cagayan de Oro City or Bukidnon, either 
early or in the second week of November, both Noble and Canoy 
attended. This is further evidenced by pictures taken on that occasion. 48 
Others present were Atty Romeo Montalban (brother-in-law of Fortich) 
and Atty Odilon Mallari of Davao City, an organizer of the MFM. 

In said meeting, Noble read a paper in which he mentioned secession. 
Canoy read the MIMs proclamation of independence. The subject of a 
coupd'etatwas also discussed. Thestandof the MFM was that if a coup 
succeeded, Mindanao should secede. Noble assured the Movement of 
protection. 

On 26 November, while in Esperanza, Agusan del Sur, Noble told 
Sgt Asterio Dejarme of the 401 IBde, 4 ID based in Camp Evangelista, 
Patag, Cagayan de Oro City, that they would go to Manila to get 
instructions from the RAM-HF command control, and that they would 
return to Mindanao to set up the Federal Republic of Mindanao. 47 That 
same day, at 6:00 p.m., Noble and Dejarme arrived at the Manila 
Domestic Airport aboard a PAL flight from Butuan City. They proceeded 
to Noble's house at 135 MacArthur Avenue, Fort Bonifacio. There, 
Dejarme was tasked to operate Noble's radio and to handle communication 
with contacts in Agusan del Sur. Dejarme learned that codes 949 and 
375 referred to Noble and Honasan, respectively. 48 

On 27 November, Sgt Romeo Evangelio, Noble's close-in bodyguard, 
joined Noble and Dejarme in Fort Bonifacio. At 10:00 a.m., Evangelio 
and Noble lea the latter's residence in Fort Bonifacio for an unknown 
destination, returning at 7:00 p.m. 49 



CHAPTER V 241 



On 28 November, Evangelio left Noble's house, returning later with 
one Galil, one machine pistol cal 9 mm, and one Zig assault rifle. 60 

At noon of the same day, on Noble's instructions, Dejarme went to 
the South Harbor on a red Land Cruiser. At the gate, the driver of the 
Land Cruiser approached the security guard who directed the former to 
a van located just outside the gate. Without askingfor pertinent papers, 
the guard unloaded from the van a wooden box which he turned over to 
the driver and Dejarme. The latter noted that there were four other 
similar boxes left inside the van. The driver told Dejarme that the items 
intheboxwerefinancedbytheCentral Intelligence Agency (CIA). Later, 
when Noble opened the box at his Fort Bonifacio residence, Dejarme saw 
thatit contained an Armburst anti-tank weapon. Earlier in the morning, 
Noble revealed to Dejarme that there would be a coup. 61 

B.1.A Noble/Batac 

On 29 November, around 9:00 p.m., a driver on board a Pajero came 
andfetched Noble and Dejarme in Fort Bonifacio. 52 They were brought 
toahouse in Gen Segundo St, Quezon City where Noble stayed for almost 
one hour 53 while Dejarme stayed in the Pcyero. 54 In Dejarme's 
supplemental statement of 3 January 1990, Dejarme pointed to this 
house near Maalikaya. It turned out to be No. 62 Gen Segundo St. 56 

Other evidence obtained by the Commission disclosed that the 
address of Crismel Verano, who was mentioned in the Galido affidavit, 
is No. 60 Segundo St, Heroes Hill, Quezon City, just adjacent to No 62^ 

According to Emmanuel Lao, owner of the lot where House No. 56, 
ken Segundo St is located, a certain Verano is the owner of the two lots 
where houses No. 58 and 60 stand. 67 

Around 10:00 p.m., Noble, with two companions — one of whom was 
identified by the Pajero's driver as Lt Col Vic Batac and who was 
o served by Dejarme to be carrying a bulging brown envelope — emerged 
™n the house and boarded the Pajero. 58 

group proceeded to Holiday Inn Hotel where Noble, Batac and 
Jf^^ entifiea companion alighted and went inside, leaving Dejarme 
jj^tne driver behind. The brown envelope was left in the Pajero; 

use it was open, Dejarme could see that it contained money which 
J|™ res tirnatedat ¥1 million. 59 Thirty minutes later, Batac called 
env 1 ^ ^dheld radio and instructed the driver to bring the brown 

ope into the hotel. The driver complied. Upon returning to the 



242 



Pajero with the envelope ("parang bawas na iyonglaman" [it seems some 
of its contents were taken] because it was no longer bulging, according 
to Dejarme), the driver told Dejarme that there were around 30 persons 
in the room with Batac and Noble. 60 

Noble and Batac stayed inside the hotel for approximately two 
hours. Later, Noble and Dejarme were brought back to the former's 
residence in Fort Bonifacio at around 2:00 a.m., 30 November. 61 

As shown in the discussion below, Bibit had already checked in at 
Room 1701 of Holiday Inn by 29 November. 

In his testimony before the Commission, Dejarme confirmed the 
foregoing. 62 He declared further that he and driver Alex Callada, on 
board a Mitsubishi car together with Noble and Evangelio, were 
intercepted at a checkpoint in Sta Rita, Samar on 5 December 1989. 
Noble and Evangelio subsequently managed to escape. Found and 
seized from the car were 1*70,000 in crisp 1*500 bills, sophisticated 
weapons including one Armburst anti-tank weapon, a rifle with a laser 
sight, and documents tending to show the tie-up of the RAM-HF and 
troops which Noble referred to as the "Armed Forces of Mindanao", and 
which he was to lead in the last coup attempt. 

Also found from the car were several documents, among which are: 

1. Aletter dated 28 November 1989 of one Yk addressed to SitAlfii 
The latter was told to contact or see Sonnv . A ndy ftauran. MJ 
Mendoza. or to relay his messages through their base (code 581); 
after making all these contacts, Alex was to meet "TF Diamond" 
at Room 1701 of the Holiday Inn. Alex was also to call Eilly. or 
Jak£ or Ah£. The codes for them were 757 for Billy, 507 for Jake 
and 711 for Abe. 

2. A draft of a press release/public statement addressed to the 
"Soldiers of Mindanao." 

3. Alertcodes for broadcast which read "Theroses that latelybloom 
in November will surely warm cool hearts by December" and 
"Dear Pare, comadre Rose will give birth anytime after 29 
November 1989. Please contact other Maninoys for the grand 
binyag." 

4. Instructions on the countersigns to be used and attached to 
/ uniforms/clothes and vehicles of coup participants. 



CHAPTER V 243 



5. Codes for pick-up points, like (a) New Library for McDonalds, 
Quezon Blvd, (b) Library for McDonalds, Paseo de Roxas, (c) 
Pennis for McDonalds, Greenhills, (d) Adamson for Shakey's 
along Katipunan Road, (e)Ealafifi for Tropical Hut, corner EDSA 
and Ortigas Avenue, and (f) HI for Holiday Inn. 

6. Papers regarding the establishment of the Armed Forces of 
Mindanao under the Federal Republic of Mindanao. 

7. Last of confirmed radio frequencies of various military units, 
base stations, and group operations centers. 

8. Code numbers relating to Malacafiang, such as the President's 
car; cars and drivers of Presidential kin Noynoy, Viel, Eldon, 
Ballsy, Pinky, Kris and Manolo and their individual code numbers; 
those of the PSG and its officers; and other operational codes. 

9. Handwritten notes containing entries about an apparent bank 

heist. 



10, A handwritten note referring to the radio network of the rebels 
containing the telephone number 810-1701. The Commission 
traced this number to someone answering on behalf of Royal 
Match, Inc, and when asked about his location answered that he 
was in Ayala Avenue. 

MGen Flores believes that Yfc referred to Victor Batac, Alex to 
Alexander Noble, Billv to Billy Bibit, Jake to Marcelino Malajacan, and 
Alifi to Abraham Purugganan. 63 

B.U. Bibit 

BibithadearlierbeenappointedbyCustomsCommissionerWigberto 
Tafiada to serve in the Customs intelligence service. Commissioner 
Jhson subsequently appointed him as Assistant Chief, Operations 
^vision of the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service (CIIS). 64 

In August 1989, Bibit had been seen in Bacolod City with an 
identified companion. 

qJ*J htelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines 
AFP) had earlier warned Mison of the recruitment activities of Bibit 
111 toe Visayas in September 1989. Mison assigned Atty Jereos, CIIS 



244 



Chief, to watch Bibit. However, Mison later admitted he had not given 
the matter his personal attention, explaining that his business was to 
raise revenues for the government. 66 

On 28 November, Bibit checked in at Room 1701, a suite at Holiday 
Inn, Manila, accompanied by another man. The room reservation was 
made in his behalf by his sister-in-law, Fe de los Reyes, secretary of the 
Chief Engineer of the hotel. 66 

During Bitot' s stay, de los Reyes wen t to his room twice for merienda- 
dinner at his invitation. On the first occasion, de los Reyes overheard 
Bibit making a telephone call; on the second occasion, the phone rang 
twice and she heard Bibit talking to the calleKs). 67 

Records of Holiday Inn show that during this period, long-distance 
telephone calls from Room 1701 were purportedly made by one Boy 
Fuentes to telephone number 22376 in Bacolod.City. This is a private 
PLDT line subscribed to the residence of one George Yap, a former 
member of the PC-Regional Security Unit 6 operating in Bacolod City. 68 
Yap went into hiding after the December 1989 failed coup attempt and 
remains at large 69 

On 29 November, at 3:11 p.m., four persons, with one transceiver, 
entered Room 1701. 70 

At about 7:30 a.m., the following day, Bibit telephoned P/Capt Job 
Gavino, Station Commander, North Harbor Port Police, and told the 
latter that he (Bibit) would be sending over his representatives for some 
important business. At 11:00 a.m., 20 men in civilian clothes arrived at 
the North Harbor Police Station looking for Gavino, supposedly on 
Bibit's orders. They tried to convince Gavino to join the rebel forces but 
he allegedly refused. 71 

In the early morning of 1 December, Bibit's room was discovered 
vacant. Because Bibit did not check out properly, de los Reyes had to pay 
his bill since she was the one who made Bibit's hotel reservation. De los 
Reyes was later reimbursed by her sister, Mrs Bibit. 72 Evidence received 
by the Commission discloses that at 2:00 a.m. of 1 December, rebel 
soldiers in full battle gear equipped with high-powered weapons arrived 
and deployed themselves all over the area of Gate 3, South Harbor, 
Manila. The soldiers numbered approximately 200 and were commanded 
by Bibit. 



CHAPTER V 245 



Rli. Rasco 



At 1:00 p.m., 28 November, in Sariaya, Quezon, a Philippine Army 
officer approached and informed 2Lt Eliseo Rasco PC, CO of the 1st 
Special Action Company, RSAF Battalion, RECOM 4, of a coup d' etat, 
and asked him to bring his troops to Sangley Point, Cavite City. 73 Two 
days later, or on the night of 30 November, a BLTB bus was found parked 
inside Camp Nakar, Lucena City. Subsequent investigation showed 
that this bus was originally contracted by Rasco to transport soldiers to 
Sangley but mistakenly, was sent to Camp Nakar instead of to Barangay 
Sto Cristo, Sariaya, Quezon. Rasco and his group got another bus and 
eventually reached Sangley. 74 Rasco used to be under Lt Col Marcelino 
Malqjacan when the latter was Battalion Commander of 16 IB. 76 

B.l.g. Fusilero 

LtColFusilero played a leading role in Cebu, particularly in Mactan 
during the December 1989 coup attempt. He was the PC Provincial 
Commander of Negros Oriental for sometime until his relief for having 
assaulted a human rights lawyer in Dumaguete City on 4 September 
1986. 76 Recalled to the RECOM 7 Headquarters in Cebu City, he was 
accused together with Abenina, then RECOM 7 Regional Commander, 
andPAF ex-Lt Col Neon Ebuen, then manager of the AFPSLAI Office 
in Cebu City, of joining the 28 August 1987 coup attempt. The three were 
charged with violation of Articles ofWar 67, 68, 96, and 97 before General 
Court Martial (GCM) No 8. Fusilero was placed under house arrest 
under the custody of the commander who took over from Abenina, BGen 
Mariano Baccay , Jr. Baccay was later transferred to Davao and replaced 
by BGen Benjamin Dizon who retired shortly before 30 November 1989. 
Kzon allowed Fusilero to roam around freely. 77 BGen Raul Imperial 
took over RECOM 7 a few days before the coup. 

During the months of September and October 1989, Fusilero was 
sighted in Negros Occidental in the company of Bibit, a former PMA 
psmate, courting the support of military officers and enlisted men 
5 » COUp attein Pt. Intelligence reports were submitted by NICOM 
Jjwmgence Officer, Maj Alphonsus Crucero, on the recruitment activities 
0 ^'ero and Bibit as early as September. 78 No pre-emptive action was 
We by higher headquarters and thus recruitment of coup supporters 
Reared to continue. 

^ Although Fusilero was facing charges before GCM No 8 for his role 
toe 28 August 1987 coup attempt, he was not prevented from going 
yte ' cer tain parts of Mindanao, and Luzon. With his motorcycle 



246 



buddies called the Cyclones, he went to Agusan del Norte and contacted 
logging concessionaire Cesar Magsay say , in whose company a brother of 
Fusilero has been employed. 79 A book entitled "A Path of the Masters" 
bearing Cesar Magsay say's name, was among the things found in 
Noble's attache case when the tatter's car was intercepted at a checkpoint 
in Sta Rita, Samar on 5 December 1989. 80 Apparently, Fusilero made 
these motorcycle caravan trips with the Cyclones as a good cover to make 
contacts with his military and civilian friends in various areas, including 
Bicol and the islands of Leyte and Samar. 81 The Cyclones also visited 
Aparri, Cagayan, bailiwick of former Governor Rodolfo Aguinaldo, 
another one of Fusilero's classmates. 

Sometime before 1 December, Fusilero was also seen at the Alavar's 
Seafood Restaurant in Cebu City, dining with Atty Homobono Adaza, an 
opposition leader from Mindanao, and BGen Comendador. 82 

In the morning of 29 November, Fusilero instructed Lt Attgusto 
Marquez, Chief, Regional Operations and Plans Branch of the R3 
Division, RECOM 7, to contact Maj Anacleto Chagas, CO of the 347th PC 
Company based in Toledo City, and to tell Chagas to go to Roy Khan 
Station Restaurant located at Osmena Boulevard, Cebu City at around 
8:00 p.m. that day. 83 Chagas went directly to the office of the Operations 
Officer or R3, RECOM 7, thinking that it was Lt Col Alphonso Uranza, 
Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations, RECOM 7, who called for him. 
Upon reaching the R3 Division office and before he could go into the office 
of Uranza, Marquez told him that there would be a meeting at Roy Khan 
Station Restaurant at 7:00 p.m. 84 While in Cebu City on official business, 
Capt Cecil Ezra Sandalo, former Aide-de-camp of Abenina and CO of the 
342nd PC Company based in Bogo, Cebu, also received a message in his 
residence from Fusilero for him to proceed to the restaurant. 86 Marquez, 
who was at the quarters of Uranza that evening with his future bride and 
in-laws, also received a call from Fusilero for him to proceed to said 
restaurant himself. 86 

During this meeting at Roy Khan Station Restaurant, Fusilero 
informed those in attendance, namely, Chagas, Sandalo, Marquez, 
Ebuen and others, who were all in civilian clothes, that the coup they 
have been waiting for, would be staged at 10:00 p.m. of the following 
day, 30 November. 87 Fusilero then gave Chagas the amount of R0,000 
in 1*100 bills in the presence of the conferees, and told Chagas to send 
troops to Mactan at 2:00 a.m. on 1 December. 88 Fusilero also requested 
Sandalo for his support, promising logistics and a handheld radio. 89 
Fusilero told Marquez that the coup would not really affect Cebu as 
troops nationwide would converge in Manila. 90 



CHAPTER V 247 



After the meeting, Chagas followed Marquez to the quarters of 
Uranza where they revealed to him the disclosure made by Fusilero. 91 
The three had a drinking session which lasted until 2:30 a.m. of 30 
November. 92 None of them saw it fit at that time to inform either BGen 
Imperial, the Regional Commander, Col Andres Superable, the Chief of 
Staff, or Lt Col Enrique Cuadra, the Provincial Commander, of what 
transpired at the restaurant. 93 

At around 6:30 a.m. of 30 November, Chagas left Toledo City and 
went directly to the quarters of his immediate superior, Lt Col Cuadra, 
informing him about what had taken place at the Roy Khan Station 
Restaurant the previous night. 94 Sandalo was also there to report the 
samematter. Cuadra instructed the two not to allow any troop movement, 
and to adhere to the chain of command. 96 

Ataboutthe same time, Marquez, whobarely hadfour hours of sleep, 
reported to his office and advised Superable that a coup would be staged 
Manila that evening. 96 Superable then instructed Marquez to gather 
more information. 97 It seems that Superable did not elicit anymore 
information from Marquez, nor did Marquez, who was briefed by Fusilero 
the previous evening, appear to have volunteered much information. 

After advising Lt Col Cuadra, M^j Chagas reported to Col Super- 
able the incident at restaurant. Superable was surprised and got mad 
upon learning that Fusilero had asked Chagas to send troops to Mactan. 
Chagas was then instructed not to make any troop movement and to 
follow the chain of command. Chagas said that he later went to see 
Marquez and gave back the ^10,000 to be returned to Fusilero; 98 
Marquez confirmed that he received the amount from Chagas and 
%d that he had returned it to Fusilero the same day at the RECOM 
7 HQ, right after Chagas told Superable that the coup would be staged 
at 10:00 p.m. that day. 99 It was only upon learning about the planned 
wupfrom Fusilero that Superable informed BGen Imperial that there 
were strong indications that a coup would be staged that day, prompting 
taperia] to call PC Chief MGen Ramon Montano. As Montano was not 
^nd at that time, Imperial called up BGen Victor Natividad, then PC/ 
p Deputy Chief, and inquired about the developments in Manila, 
imperial asked Natividad: "Sir, may mga bali-balita dito na may 
y&ayari ngayon. Mayroon ba kayong balita riyanT (Sir, we have 
^shere that something is going to happen. What's the news on your 
To which query Natividad retorted: "Anong ibig mong sabihin na 

y nmgyayari ngayon (What are you referring to), can you give me 
21 detail8?w Imperial answered thus: "Wala nga Sir, hay a nagtatanong 

kun 8 "uyroon kayong balita riyan mo ° (We have none, Sir, that's why 



248 



I'm asking if you yourself have news). Imperial said that Superable did 
not convey to him the information given by Fusilero that the coup would 
occur at 10 p.m. on 30 November, although, he admitted that Superable 
mentioned to him of troop movements scheduled for 2:00 a.m. the 
following day. 

B.1 Ji. Purugganan and Lim 

Maj Abraham Purugganan and Capt Danilo Lim held meetings in 
Fort Bonifacio in October and November respectively. The first meeting 
was reportedly held at the office of Purugganan. In attendance were 
Col Luisito Sanchez, Capt Rogelio Bonifacio, Capt Lim, Capt Nestor 
Flordeliza, Capt Joe Cruz, Lt Stephen Flores, Lt Charles Galvez and 
enlisted personnel including MSgt Demabildo. It was mentioned that 
an "activity" may happen sometime. 101 

The second was held at the FSRR office and was also led hy 
Purugganan and lim. Other officers who attended were Capt Felix 
Calimag, Capt Roberto Rusio, Capt Jose Barao, Capt Pablo Casalme, Lt 
Allen Capuyan, Lt Samuel Bactad, and 2Lt Napoleon Mabalot. Each 
was asked for his particular field of interest and function in office. 102 

B.2. Related Activities 

B.2.a. Davao del Sur 

The 19-25 January 1990 issue of the Philippine M usllTP TiTnea 
reported that certain Army authorities based in General Santos City 
were behind the alleged arrival of Irwin Ver and Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr 
at the latter's farm in Malita, Davao del Sur, on 23 November 1989. An 
intelligence report of a senior NBI agent in Davao City dated 22 January 
1990 further revealed flights of two private aircrafts during the week of 
20 November in the vicinity of Malita at a private airstrip owned by a 
company controlled by the Cojuangcos and at the Davao International 
Airport. 103 

Taking these news item and report as leads, the Commission was 
able to obtain information and evidence which may have some connection 
with the arrival of Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr, a personality mentioned in 
the Galido affidavit who incidentally arrived a few days before the coup 
attempt. 



CHAPTER V 249 



The Chartered Flight to Kota Kinabalu 

On 20 November at 9:15 a.m., a plane registered as RP-C585 left 
Manila for Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia with a lone passenger, Roberto 
Huang. Theplane waspilotedby Capt Adriano Morales and Capt Loreto 
Vergeire. 104 

Capt Morales initially told the Commission that the flight was 
chartered by Jayapuri Brunei Ltd and arranged through the Executive 
and Tourist Aviation, a company owned by Chemical Industries of the 
Philippines, Inc and managed by him. Huang, later testified that "about 
two or three* months before 20 November, a certain Oliver Ker, a 
Malaysian whom Huang had accidentally met in one of the casinos in 
Metro Manila, called him by telephone. Ker told Huang that he would 
arrange for him to visit Kota Kinabalu. Around 20 October, Huang was 
allegedly calledby another man (whose name Huang could not remember), 
claiming to be the manager of Jayapuri, who told him that "they were 
contacted by Ker to arrange for a chartered flight for me [Huang] . . In 
any case, Huang was requested to assist in getting a charter and so he 
asked Capt Vergeire to arrange it. 

The route contracted for, as authorized by Jayapuri, was Manila- 
KotaKnabalu-Manila. 105 Without the prior knowledge of either Jayapuri 
or Ker, Huang added Davao City to the itinerary. According to Huang, 
aridetrip to Davao City would not make that much difference in price, 
and so he and Capt Vergeire decided to do it on their own . However, the 
Price differential and the flying time are not likely to be negligible 
^use Capt Morales, in a sworn statement, said that Manila, Kota 
Enabalu, and Davao are like the three points of an equilateral triangle 
N shown in Figure V-l. 



250 



Figure V-l — Flight Diagram of 
Manila-Kota Kinabalu-Davao-Manila 




At any rate, the total cost of the charter flight was a little over US 
$6,000. About two weeks before 20 November, around US $5,000 was 
sent to Huang allegedly from Ker through an emissary whose identity 
Huang could not remember. The foreign exchange was not surrendered 
to the banking system. Approximately US $4,000 was given to Vergeire 
as down payment, while Huang kept the balance. When asked whether 
Vergeire issued him a receipt, Huang first said a I cannot remember, but 
I think so . . " and then corrected himself and said a receipt was issued 
"because I remember he [Capt Vergeire] wrote 'Jayapuri' on the receipt" 
But in the end, Huang confessed that he was not really sure a receipthad 
been issued. Capt Vergeire, he said, was not really authorized to issue 
a receipt because, "from what I know, the airline is not his own or he does 
not work for the airline" whose plane they had used. 



When asked whether a charter contract was in fact executed to cover 
theflight, Huang claimed: "I am not familiar with it. I don't know if there 
was a contract signed by Mr Vergeire with whom, to whoever, I don't 
know." Ker, for his part, apparently did not object to the informality of 
the arrangement, even if this was the first and only time Ker had 
arranged for Huang to charter a flight to Kota Kinabalu. 

Huang alleged that the purpose of the trip was to make a deal about 
an oil mill, belonging to an insolvent company under receivership. It was 
situated about 200 kilometers from Kota Kinabalu, in a place whose 
exact name Huang could not remember. 

The plane landed in Kota Kinabalu at 11:50 a.m. of 20 November. 
The pilots and Huang stayed there for three days, billeted in separate 
rooms at the Hyatt Hotel. Neither Morales nor Vergeire claimed to know 
what Huang did or whom he met. Capt Morales even disclaimed 
knowing whether Huang stayed at the Hyatt Hotel in Kota Kinabalu. 106 
On the other hand, Huang admitted that he told the pilots that he was 
checkingin at the Hyatt Hotel and that on one occasion, the pilots invited 
him for a drink at the hotel lobby. 

Huang did not meet with Ker until "in the afternoon, in the evening*. 
They agreed to see the oil mill the next day, after which Huang would 
meet its receiver. 

On 21 November, Ker and Huang went to the mill site and were there 
for less than two hours. They were permitted by the guard to look at the 
machineries and they saw that "there are about 12 units of them . . 
Huang considered the mill as still saleable, but, as a bargaining ploy, he 
described it to Ker as "in a very bad condition". 

The following day, Ker told Huang that the receiver would not be 
Me to meet him. No reason was given. In fact, not even the name of the 
receiver was revealed by Ker. The wasted time, effort and money did not 
seem to bother Huang. After all, he claimed to have "earned a few bucks,* 

said that the money spent was not his. 

On 23 November, the plane left Kota Kinabalu at 2:00 p.m. for Davao 
Cl ty, allegedly with only Huang as the passenger. 107 At Davao Inter- 
national Airport, it was met by PAFSECOM, the Bureau of Customs and 

Commission on Immigration and Deportation personnel. After 
filing, the plane left for Manila. 



252 



There are conflicting testimonies on the number of passengers 
aboard the flight to Manila, but there was unanimity on the point that 
Huang was not one of them. 108 

The plane arrived in Manila at 7:45 p.m., 23 November. 



Huang maintained that although the leg from Davao to Manila was 
already paid for, he really intended to disembark in Davao all along 
because it was imperative for him to brief his business associate, a 
certain Jess Quiogue, on what had transpired in Kota Kinabalu, He 
admitted, however, thathe had made no prior appointment with Quiogue. 
Yet, instead of calling Quiogue from the Davao airport to find out if they 
could meet, Huang went to Davao Insular Hotel. He took his time before 
trying to contact Quiogue, who turned out to be in Manila. So Huanghad 
to take the last PAL flight to Manila. 

The Commission also received evidence showing that on 21 November, 
another aircraft, registered as RP-C410, ownedby Agricultural Investors, 
Inc, an Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr company presently under PCGG 
sequestration, left Manila at 10:43 a.m. for Bacolod with Enrique 
Cojuangco, Ramon Ang, and Danilo Gamboa, as passengers. 109 The 
aircraft arrived in Bacolod at 11:57 a.m. and stayed there until 12:06 
noon of 22 November, at which time it flew to Malita, Davao del Sur with 
Cojuangco and Ang as passengers. Gamboa was left behind in Bacolod. 
At 4:33 p.m. of 23 November, RP-C410 flew from Malita to Manila 
allegedly with Enrique Cojuangco and Ang as the only passengers. 110 

These two flights present a number of coincidences. For instance, all 
the pilots are somehow connected with Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr. Hie pilot 
of RP-C410, Capt Jose Castillo, admits to having piloted for Eduardo 
Cojuangco, Jr several times in the past. He met with him personally at 
least once, between 23 November 1989 and 30 November 1989 at 
Cojuangco's residence at Balete Drive, Quezon City. The co-pilot of RP- 
C585, Capt Vergeire, was a pilot of the Cojuangcos for 14 years. He too 
admitted that he met with Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr at his residence after 
he had learned of his return. Morales initially denied knowing Eduardo 
Cojuangco, Jr personally, but later, in his sworn statement of 7 
September 1990, he confirmed what Castillo had stated under oath, 
namely that "Morales, . . . taught them [Eduardo and Enrique Cojuangco] 
how to fly years ago . . ." ln 

In addition, both Vergeire and Castillo were aware of each other's 
whereabouts on 23 November without having actually talked to each 
other. When Vergeire lea Manila, as pilot of RP-C585 on 20 November, 



CHAPTER V 253 



hedid not know that Castillo was going to fly RP-C410 the next day. But 
Vergeire claimed to have known that Castillo was flyingnear Davao City 
on 23 November in the afternoon because he allegedly "heard him 
through the radio" Castillo also admitted knowing Vergeire's where- 
abouts at the same time because he "heard his voice over the radio." 

It must be noted that by the time Vergeire in RP-C585 flew into the 
Davao Airport at 4:45 p.m., Castillo had already taken off from Malita 
about twelve minutes earlier. Morales admitted that he and Vergeire 
started radio contact with the Davao International Airport tower only 
when they were over Cotabato. Furthermore, the Aircraft Flight 
Logbook Report (No 6301) of RP-C410 reports its "microphone weak" and 
"radio altimeter out". Still, both pilots claimed they knew where the 
other one was during this time. 

What seems significant to the Commission is the admission made by 
Morales that RP-C585 could have flown from Kota Kinabalu and landed 
atMalita before proceeding to the Davao International Airport 112 without 
the government authorities finding out. Malita is on the direct line of 
aflight from Kota Kinabalu to Davao City. Morales insisted that they 
did not land at Malita. However, it took them two hours and 45 minutes 
to fly from Kota Kinabalu to Davao City and only two hours and ten 
minutes to negotiate the nearly equal distance from Davao City to 
Manila. 113 Varying flight conditions could possibly account for the 
difference of 35 minutes, although such time could also be used to land 
and unload a passenger in Malita, 

B& Government Activities 

In the meantime, bits and pieces of information related to a coup 
attempt were either gathered by or filtered into the various intelligence 
services of the Armed Forces. 

National Capital Region 

In Manila, on 3 November, BGen Rodolfo Biazon, CG, National 
Capital Region Defense Command (NCRDC), detected that a coup 
attempt was shapingup and that there would be an alliance between the 
KAM-HF and the Loyalists. 114 

&&b. Camp Aguinaldo 



On 21 October, in Camp Aguinaldo, elements of the security force of 
& President Laurel under M^j Gamos and Lt Calimag were reportedly 



254 



preparing plans, vehicles, codenames and numbers, and sketches of 
streets and buildings, all presumably in preparation for the coup. 116 

At Camp Aguinaldo, on 28 November, an unconfirmed report was 
received from the Intelligence Office of the Philippine Marines regarding 
the plan of some officers to launch a coup within the week FSRR 
elements were pinpointed as participants. The wife of Lt Rodolfo 
Cachola was identified as the source of the report. Mrs Cachola revealed 
that her husband and another officer undergoing Scout Ranger training 
in San Quintin, Pangasinan were called to FSRR HQ in Fort Bonifacio 
and were briefed on the forthcoming coup. Lt Cachola relayed this 
information to his wife with instructions to report it to the Philippine 
Marines. 116 

B.S.C. Fort Bonifacio 

In Fort Bonifacio, also in October 1989, Col Raul Urgello recommended 
to MGen Manuel Cacanando, CG PA, the relief of Capt Lim and Lt Julius 
Flores from their positions as FSRR's Assistant Chief of Staff for 
Operations (G3) and Intelligence Officer, respectively, based on Urgello's 
observation that said officers had united the Scout Rangers against 
BGen Rene Cardones, CG FSRR. 117 

On 2 November, on suspicion that the Scout Rangers and the 
Marines would participate in a coup attempt, an artillery battery 
consisting of five pieces of 105 mm Howitzers were pulled out of the 
Rangers leaving the FSRR with three defective ones. 118 

Before 30 November, BGen Cardones received reports that certain 
FSRR officers were holding meetings which he believed were for the 
purpose of motivating people to participate in a coup. Moreover, before 
1 December, he received reports of visits made by BGen Blando to FSRR 
HQ which were not cleared with him, contrary to military protocol. 
Cardones also observed that Blando continued to have contacts with 
Purugganan, Lim, Galvez and Sanchez, all FSRR officers. 119 

B.3.d. Villamor Air Base 

In J une 1989 , Ebuen was reported to be visiting PAF bases recruiting 
officers and men for the coup. 120 

On 3 October, the PAF Intelligence Office received reports about a 
RAM-HF plan to undertake a coup attempt during the visit of President 
Aquino to the United States in November 1989. 121 The following day the 



CHAPTER V 255 



Air Intelligence and Security Group received information on the formation 
of a group calling itself the Young Officers Union (YOU) reportedly 
poised to stage a coup if the Aquino government did nothing about the 
Uzi-Galil-Car-Buko scandals. 122 

On 27 November, PAF received information about YOlTs plan to 
stage a coup, making their first move in Sangley. 123 



B,3.e. Cavite 



In October 1989, a group of military personnel was reported to be 
recruiting at Sangley Point for another coup attempt, allegedly 
offering flO,000 to 1*20,000 to each recruit. 124 



B.3i. Central Luzon 



In November, elements of the Angeles Metropolitan District 
Command (METRODISCOM), Pampanga PC/INP Command, Olongapo 
METR0DISCOM, Zambales PC/INP Command and SUBCOM were 
purportedly recruited for a coup attempt. 126 

B.3.g. Laguna 

In August, Capt Rafael Cardeno, reportedly of the PC Criminal 
Investigation Service (CIS), visited his PMA classmate, Capt Melito 
Mabilin, police station commander of San Pedro, Laguna, at the latter's 
office, and gave Capt Mabilin 10 to 15 photocopies of infor-mation sheets 
on the YOU, which was said to be composed of officers from the ranks of 
captains to majors only. According to Mabilin, his wife burned the 
papers. 126 



B^Ji. Pampanga 

In Angeles City, before the opening of classes in June 1989, Capt 
*elizardo Serapio, Jr, CO 174th PC Company, was visited by his 
compadre and PMA classmate (Class 77), Capt Roque Maranon. At that 

^Maranon was under detention for his alleged involvement in the 
* e ge of Camp Olivas during the 28 August 1987 failed coup. Maranon 
^3 allegedly out on pass from detention to attend a court hearing. 

though Serapio disclaimed that Maranon tried to recruit him, he did 
^discount the possibility that Maranon's mention of his "assets" in 
Jj!^ ity was : the latter's indirect way of recruiting him. Serapio also 
eff ^ tim e, he had received information regarding recruitment 

°n» in his area by rightist elements in the Constabulary. 127 



256 



B,3J. Cebu 

During the PC Day Anniversary celebration in Cebu City in August 
1989, Fusilero spread the news that a coup would take place. 128 

At Punta Engano, Lapu-Lapu City, in September, an enlisted man 
under the Negros Island Command (NICOM) was approached by 
unidentified persons to join Fusilero in the planned coup. Members of 
the "Lost Command" of ex-Col Carlos Lademora were reportedly in Cebu 
meeting with some coup plotters. 129 

Maj Alphonsus Crucero, NICOM Staff Officer for Intelligence, 
overheard FSRR officers complaining about the military leadership 
and about reforming the whole system. 130 

In October, BGen Palmaheld a meeting with major unit commanders 
in Camp Lapu-Lapu, Cebu City, to discuss rumors of a coup and to 
emphasize the importance of following the chain of command. A 
separate meeting was held with BGen Comendador, who, when asked 
what his stand was, allegedly answered that he would follow the chain 
of command. 131 

B.3 j. Negros Occidental 

In the first week of September, Fusilero and other suspected RAM- 
HF leaders were reportedly in Negros Occidental courting the supportof 
officers and enlisted men. 132 

At Negros Occidental, in the second week of September, Lt Col 
Anthony Lim of the 5th Scout Ranger Battalion (5 SRB) and Lt Col Roy 
Kyamko, CO 7 IB reported to BGen Jarque, CG NICOM, that Bibit was 
soliciting their support for a coup attempt. 133 In Hinigaran, Negros 
Occidental, in the fourth week of October, ex-Lt Col Bibit arrived with a 
group at the wake of the late MSgt Tomas Angostura PC. He also 
inquired from Lopez, CO 332nd PC Company, about the peace and 
order situation and the morale and welfare of the men. When asked why 
he was in the area, Bibit said that he just wished to condole with 
Angostura's family and that he was going around visiting "friends". 184 

At Bacolod City in August, Bibit was seen with an unidentified 
companion at the Alice Log Cabin ; he was also seen by MSgt Zoilo Ramos 
at the Golden Field Complex. 136 



CHAPTER V 257 



In September, a conference was reportedly held on the island of 
Pulupandan near Guimaras attended by some prominent businessmen 
and military officers. A separate report was received on the frequent 
meetings between some hacienda owners and disgruntled PC officers 
concerning a coup attempt. 136 

In Bacolod City, on 4 November, it was learned that a coup had been 
planned to be carried out during President Aquino's visit to the US. 
However, it was allegedly aborted because the RAM-HF could not secure 
fall support from its contacts. Continuous rebel recruitment to the level 
tf battalion commanders and officers of NICOM was being monitored. 137 



B.S.L Dumaguete City 



AtDumaguete City in the third week of November, P/Capt Rogelio 
Bais, INP, Deputy Station Commander for Administration of the 
Dumaguete City police station, received a call that some armed men 
were at the South Sea Hotel & Restaurant. A team responded and 
reported that the armed men were military personnel led by Fusilero. 
No further action was taken by the police authorities. 138 

B.31 DavaoCity 

On 20 November, an alleged study group from the Special Intelli- 
gence Training School (SITS), ISAFP, under a certain Capt de Guzman 
of the PAF, arrived in CampCatitipan, Davao City, supposedly to 
conduct a survey among officers and enlisted personnel, directed by the 
CSAFP. Questions asked related to the probability of a coup d'etat. 139 

On 23 November, Capt Gerry Diamante appeared at the 8 IB HQ, 
Camp Catitipan, Davao City and talked to the Battalion Executive 
^cer (EX-O), Maj Roberto Bara, warning the latter of the movement 
which had started its "countdown" and that it would soon "explode". 140 

The local government officials in Davao del Norte were alerted of 
«ors of coup d'etat which would take place at Davao City and the 
Central Bank branch therein would be the target of rebel soldiers. 141 On 
^November 1989, the study group of SITS, ISAFP was tasked to survey 
we military camps in view of the information of a pending coup d'etat, 
nence, full red alert status was enforced in all units by BGen Baccay, 
. 0 also called an emergency conference. It was learned that some 
pior officers had been conducting clandestine meetings in Davao City 
ttthe past few days with 2Lt Cesar Mancao as one of the active 
Participants in the meeting. 142 



258 



B.3an. Agusan del Sur 

On 22 November, Capt Diamante appeared at 401 Bde HQ, Agusan 
del Sur, to inform the Brigade Commander, Col Cristobal Gurrea, and 
staff officers about the "Movement to Free Mindanao," which he said 
would be launched within the month. Initiated by young military 
officers, the movement plans to sever Mindanao from Luzon and establish 
a revolutionary government. Diamante stated that the revolutionary 
government would be organized in coordination with other secessionist 
groups. 143 

Other pre-coup activities which form an integral part of certain 
events are left out of this section and are included instead in the 
respective battle zone narratives.

NARRATIVES OF BATTLE ZONES 

C. Fort Bonifacio and Villamor Air Base 

The takeover of Fort Bonifacio was critical because of the tactical 
importance of the camp. Fort Bonifacio has the biggest ammunition 
depot in the Philippines where the Light Armor Brigade (LABde) with 
their armored vehicles, plus armories of high-powered weapons and 
combat equipment are found. Howitzers based in Fort Bonifacio can lay 
its deadly ammunition all the way to Malacanang and Camp Aguinaldo. 
Another reason was that the headquarters of the elite fighting units of 
the AFP, the First Scout Ranger Regiment (FSRR) of the Army and the 
Philippine Marines (PMAR) of the Navy, are based inside the camp. 

Signals of a Coup 

After hearing several reports of an impending coup, a group of 
Philippine Army Intelligence Officers of the 15th Intelligence and 
Security Unit (ISU) held a meeting in the morning of 29 November at 
their headquarters. 144 However, the conferees merely confirmed receipt 
of such information and dismissed the same as rumors. 

Unfortunately, the unconfirmed reports proved to be true. On the 
evening of 29 November, Scout Rangers of the 14 SR Coy, FSRR, under 
Capt Jaime Junio based in Tagay tay, attacked the PAF Repeater Station 
in Tagaytay City. This was to signal the start of the attempted coup. 148 
By 10:00 p.m. of 29 November, reports were received that elements from 
this company had destroyed the antennae of the PAF Repeater Station. 146 
However, they failed to cut the cable of the communications equipment 
This enabled the radio operator in Tagaytay to contact the duty operator 
atVABandwas able to report the incident to Col DominadorSalac, pAF 
Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence (A2), at about 10:15 that 
evening. 147 

This message was relayed to Col Rene Dado, PA Assistant Chief of 
Staff for Operations, (G3), who was at the Army Operations Center 
(AOC). The AOC is near the Communications Center (COMCENTEB) 
which houses the communications facilities of the Army. As Operations 
Officer of the Philippine Army, Dado issued a directive to the Post 
Commander of Fort Bonifacio to strengthen the security of all vital 
installations. He also directed the CO of Task Force Bonifacio to send 
elements of his unit to beef up security at the AOC. 148 



CHAPTER V 261 



There were indications that the attack in Tagaytay was premature. 
In subsequent interrogation of the arrested rebels by men under BGen 
Rene Cardones, (CG FSRR), one of the men arrested remarked to the 
investigator: "Napauna lang 'yung tira ndmin doon kagabi, [actually] 
mmayanggabipayungpukpukan (Last night's attack was premature, 
the action is later tonight). 149 As pointed out by BGen Loven Abadia, 
WingCommander 205 HW, Junio "got his signals crossed" as the attack 
•got everybody curious". 150 

C.l. Movement of Scout Rangers in Fort Bonifacio 

C.l.a. 30 November 

Preparation of Scout Ranger Troops 

At 2:00 a.m., Capt Jose Agdeppa, course director of the FSRR on 
traininginstructedhis trainees to withdraw their rifles and ammunitions. 
He issued M-16 rifles and 60 rounds of ammos with magazines per 
soldier. It must be noted that at this time, aside from the FSRR HQ staff 
and trainees, there were no Ranger units assigned in Fort Bonifacio as 
all other units were deployed outside the camp. Most of the Rangers 
inside the camp were trainees at the Retraining Center under Agdeppa. 
The Rangers were supposed to graduate by 28 November but to allow 
them to stay longer in Fort Bonifacio, their graduation was deliberately 
delayed. 161 Capt Lim coordinated the other Scout Rangers who belonged 
to the HQ Company. 152 

It was reported that the sudden increase in the number of Scout 
Rangers inside the camp was due to the arrival of personnel comingfrom 
other SR units, like the 4 SRB under Lt Col Galvez stationed in Isabela, 
we 9 SR Coy under Capt Albert Yen at Fort Magsaysay, and the 14 SR 

under Junio in Tagaytay City. These troops moved from their home 
to to Port Bonifacio, and "infiltrated'' or un-officially joined the other 
wt Rangers based inside the camp a few days before 30 November 



By early dawn of 30 November, intelligence officers were receiving 
ounti ng information which pointed to an impending coup. There were 
*»U that Honasan and Bibit were present at Ilang-ilang St, North 
jmbo in Fort Bonifacio. Counter-intelligence operatives conducted 
glance in the area but found no sign of them. 164 Thirteen of the 
ers who raided the AFP communications station in Tagaytay were 
SRC * CAPC0M tro °P s - The arrested soldiers belonged to the 14 
°y- Three of these soldiers, Pfc Joseph Soriano, Sgt Eduardo 



262 



Acevedo and Cpl Maguillen were investigated by personnel of BGen 
Cardones. 

Meeting of PA Officers 

At 8:00 a.m. of 30 November, seeing that the veracity of the reports 
about an impending coup was becoming clearer, Capt Jaime Yangzon, 
Assistant Chief, Operations Branch G3, PA called a conference of all 
junior battle staff officers to disseminate the information received about 
the coup. He then ordered the officers to take the necessary security 
measures in the event that the reported coup materialized. 166 

At 10:00 a.m., Col Dado instructed the intelligence officer of the 
Headquarters and Headquarters Service Group (HHSG) to monitor 
activities of Scout Rangers within Fort Bonifacio. 167 

Also by this time, Col Cesar llano, Commander of the PA Security 
and Intelligence Service Group (SISG), received a report from Capt 
Ralph Villanueva, Commander 3 ISU, that a coup was to be launchedin 
the evening of the same day or early dawn of 1 December. 168 llano called 
a conference of officers of the SISG. He asked his EX-O, Lt Col Rodolfo 
Garcia, to preside over the conference, so that the former could call up his 
chief, Col Raul Urgello, PA Intelligence Officer (G2). Urgello, however, 
was tired and dizzy from lack of sleep due to the interrogation he 
conducted on Junio, and so he in structed llano to inform MGen Cacanando 
directly. 

At 3:00 p.m., llano went to HPAbut did not find Cacanando who was 
then in Baguio attending the launching of the "No Hazing Movement? 
and the Recognition Day rites at the PMA. llano instead met Dado and 
told the latter of the impending coup. At that time, Dado was preparing 
to leave for Bataan the following day (1 December) to assume the 
command of the 702 Bde. He told llano that if a coup occurs after his 
departure, Lt Col Jaime Ligot, the Deputy Operations Officer, can take 
over. llano rejoined the conference of the intelligence officers, who were 
still waiting for him, at about 5:30 p.m. 159 

Cacanando left Baguio at around 3:00 p.m. 160 On his way to Manila, 
he first heard about the impending coup at 7:00 p.m. when President 
Aquino called him by phone and asked "What's this startling report, 
General?", referring to the reported attack by the Scout Rangers on the 
PAF communications facility in Tagaytay City. She also asked him to 
cancel his 4 December trip to the US. 161 



CHAPTER V 263 



Cacanando immediately called his General Staff by phone and 
ordered that a conference be held at his quarters later that evening upon 
his arrival. He also ordered Col Abraham Paray to put all armor assets 
within Fort Bonifacio on alert status, to which the latter complied. 162 At 
about5:OOp.m., the junior battle staff of the AOC was activated to direct, 
monitor, and prepare contingency forces. 163 

Meanwhile, the number of Scout Rangers in Fort Bonifacio had 
Bwelled to include elements of the 4 SRB from Isabela, which arrived in 
batches at Brgy Militar (Brgy Sto Nino) in Fort Bonifacio. They reputedly 
were the same elements who were monitored at about 1:15 p.m. by the 
NuevaEcija Constabulary Command, passing through the area aboard 
three 6x6 trucks, one jeep and one pick-up. 166 

In the early evening of 30 November, Col llano went to the G2 (PA) 
(ColUrgello's) office to wait for MGen Cacanando. There, Maj Rodolfo 
Espiritu, Intelligence Chief Operations Officer, reported the entry of 
civilians carrying bayongs on board jeepneys and going to the FSRR HQ. 
This information was submitted to the G2. 166 By 7:00 p.m., ISU Ope- 
rations Officer Capt Percival Abu had obtained information about a plan 
to hold Cacanando hostage by the Special Intervention Platoon (SIP) 
under Lt Vicente Gregorio Tomas, who was reported to have sided with 
the rebels. 187 Ironically, the SIP was supposed to be the unit assigned to 
protect the CG PA in case of a coup. Likewise, Tomas was a most 
unlikely coup participant. He was with Col Dado in Camp Aguinaldo 
during the August 1987 coup attempt, when they both defended the 
government against Honasan. During that engagement Tomas was 
wounded. 



At 6:30 p.m. llano prepared a written report of the intelligence 
formation he gathered. 168 He sent copies thereof to Cacanando and to 
pother units. The copy for Cacanando was delivered by Capt Rodrigo 
wang and was received by Maj Yano at the quarters of Cacanando. 169 

The Scout Ranger rebel troops were consolidated and made combat 
at about 8:00 p.m. of 30 November. In preparation for the planned 
Macks, M^j Purugganan and Capt Lim held a third meeting at the 
^ce of the G2 FSRR to finalize their plans. It will be recalled that their 
Wtwo meetings were held in October and early November. 

At this third meeting, the group already included Capt Ed Malabanjot 



wino Valencia. They were informed that the "activity* would 
J place b y 3:00 a.m. of 1 December 1989. Their task included the 
«*eoverof HPA, AOC, 808 Custodial Company, INPTRACOM, and 



264 

Gates 1 and 2. Capt Jose Cruz, FSRR Logistics Officer, was assigned 
to provide supplies and equipment. 170 

At 9:00 p.m. the rebel Rangers had started to move in different 
directions. Thirty minutes later, they took control of the Area Research 
Center. Further information revealed that Marcos Loyalist troops were 
ready to lend their support. 171 Rebel soldiers aboard two 6x6 trucks 
passed through the vicinity of the HPA and moved towards the AOC. 17 * 

At about 10:00 p.m., MGen Cacanando arrived at his quarters. He 
convened the Staff Conference which he had called for while en route 
from Bagnio City. This was attended by the General Staff of the PA with 
selected Post Unit Commanders. 173 Cacanando and the Staff discussed 
the reports about the attack on Tagaytay and on the reported coup. The 
former ordered the security at Gates 1, 2 and 3, including the detention 
centers, strengthened. He gave further instructions to his officers to 
meet him in a conference at the AOC with the entire Battle Staff. They 
then proceeded to the AOC at about 12:00 midnight. 174 



The Takeover of the Headquarters Philippine Army 

Lt Col Ligot was at his office inside the HPA when rebel soldiers on 
board the two 6x6 trucks passed by the vicinity of the HPA reception 
area. He called the AOC, to which Dado had proceeded upon Cacanando's 
instructions, to verify if the troop movement was authorized. He learned 
from Capt Edgardo Gurrea that the soldiers were not friendly troops. 
BGen Lisandro Abadia called from Camp Aguinaldo and, upon being 
briefed about the development instructed Ligot to lock the HPA doors 
and not to let the troopers enter. Ligot complied. 

Lt Col Julius Javier, the PA EX-O, who was at the AOC, tried to call 
HPA but to no avail as he found the phone lines dead. Ligot then ordered 
the accounting of personnel who were also told to stay dispersed inside 
the Army Operations (G3) office. Capt Glorioso Miranda who was among 
the armed troopers outside, went to the HPA to talk to Ligot, who was 
the highest ranking officer present at that time. Miranda gave the 
assurance that there was no intention to harm anyone and requested 
that the door of the building be opened. Upon hearing this, Ligot acceded 
but only Miranda was allowed to enter the building. The latter also 
requested that the offices of MGen Cacanando and BGen Ramberto 
Saavedra, Chief of Staff PA, be opened. 

^ S^°i7 0 5° ^ the rest of Miran <k's troops had assumed control of 
the HPA. Government personnel did not resist because they were 



CHAPTER V 265 



outnumbered. The rebels pointed their guns and rifles at Government 
personnel and demanded their surrender. The latter were disarmed and 
told to follow whatever instructions the captors would give. 176 The 
raiders were led by Capts Pablo Casalme and Miranda and 2Lt Arnulfo 
Pajarillo. 177 

Then at 10:30 p.m. power lines in Fort Bonifacio were cut, resulting 
in a total blackout. 178 Rebel troops took over Gate 1 of Fort Bonifacio at 
Pateros. These troops were students of the Mortar Gunnery Course 
of the FSRR. They took their firearms, M-60 machine guns with 300 
bullets each, from the Regimental Troop School. Supply room personnel 
didnot want to allow the withdrawal of the firearms, but were prevailed 
upon to do so by Capt Fidel Legiralde, Jr. 179 There were reports that 
Capts Cruz, Agdeppa, Lim, and Jose Barao and Lt Cesario Almendras 
supervised and distributed firearms, ammunition, and equipment to 
rebel Rangers. 180 

The intelligence information gathered by Capt Abu about Lt Tomas 
of the SIP siding with the rebels came as a surprise. Upon learning this 
from Abu by phone, Lt Danilo Estropia of Cacanando's Security Services 
team confronted Tomas about the report. Tomas confirmed it saying "Go 
m sila (referring to the SIP)". 181 

The situation became serious as the very platoon tasked to guard the 
AOC had joined the rebels. Worse, the AOC was the venue of MGen 
Cacanando's conference with the PA staff officers scheduled at about 
midnight of 30 November. 182 

U Estropia then went to the ISG Office and broke the news to Col 
llano. At about 11:00 p.m. of 30 November, Estropia and llano went to 
*e AOC and tried to warn Cacanando, who was not yet there when the 
tooarrived. llano then relayed the information to BGen Saavedra who 
» turn asked Capt Morales what troops were below the AOC Office. The 
latter said they were the SIP. Overhearing this, Col Dado interrupted 
and said u atin yan n (They are ours). llano warned the personnel at the 
AOC not to let them come up because they would capture Cacanando. 
hereafter, llano left the AOC and went back to his office. 183 It remains 
^confirmed, however, whether Saavedra received llano's report. 

As recounted by Col Paray, Lt Tomas was manning a checkpoint 
J^rfche Bachelor Officers Quarters (BOQ) in Fort Bonifacio at about 
ll; 40 p.m. of 30 November. Paray was allowed to pass through and 
Proceeded to inspect the 4th Light Armor Company Separate (4 LACS) 
* check on the readiness of armored vehicles and crew in case of any 



266 



eventuality. 184 Then, he went on to the AOC for the staff meeting called 
by Cacanando. Paray reached the AOC at 12:35 a.m. 1 December and 
saw Cacanando, Saavedra, Col Dionedo Villanueva, PA Personnel 
Officer (Gl), Col Dado, Col Reynaldo Gopilan, PA Logistics Officer (G4), 
Majs Benjamin Magday and Cesar Javier, Capts Gurrea, Yangzon, 
Jesus Abante, and some other AOC junior officers. 186 

C.l.b. 1 December 

Escape ofMGen Cacanando from the AOC 

Before midnight of 30 November, rebels had already taken over the 
HPA, located some 100 meters from the AOC. Col Gopilan at the AOC 
received a report from Capt Carlos Holganza of the PA Plans Office (G5) 
about the presence of rebel Rangers around the HPA 186 At this time, Lt 
Estropia asked MGen Cacanando's Aide-de-camp, Lt Ronaldo Manahan, 
u Alam na ba ni CG na si Tomas ang papasok diloT (Does the CGknow 
that Tomas will take over here?). Surprised, Lt Manahan relayed this 
to Maj Carlos Calanog. 187 Immediately, Calanog led Cacanando out of 
the AOC, boarding a wagon together with two aides, Lts Manahan and 
Sayson. 188 

At the same time, Rangers entering the AOC compound stopped the 
outgoing wagon at the gate. They pointed their guns towards its 
occupants and shouted "Halt! Halt!" Pretending to be with the Rangers, 
Estropia shouted back "Clear na yan. Si Maj Calanog yan" (That 
vehicle has clearance. Maj Calanog is inside). The wagon was allowed 
to pass leaving Estropia behind. He later noticed that Lt Yogyog was 
leading the team of Rangers manning the gate. 189 Cacanando and his 
group then proceeded to the HHSG about one kilometer to the left of 
AOC. Phone lines at the AOC were suddenly cut. 190 

FSRR elements aboard two trucks arrived at the AOC at about 12:40 
a.m. of 1 December. No resistance was put up by the SIP under Tomas. 
By 1:00 a.m., all SIP elements wore the rebel forces' countersign. The 
guards previously manning the gates were herded to one side and 
instructed not to make any false moves. 191 

Because MGen Cacanando was incommunicado, Gen de Villa 
appointed BGen Galido as acting CG PA 

The officers at Cacanando's conference were held hostage by rebel 
Rangers. Among the rebels were Col Sanchez, Lt Col Galvez, M*U* 
Valenciaand Purugganan, Capts Yen, Dominador Pagulayan, Fernando 



CHAPTER V 267 



Abuan, Ernesto Cutiyog, and Essel Soriano and Lts Galvez, Tomas, 
Alvin Tiamwatt and Agane Adriatico. 192 The rebel Rangers also took 
control of the nearby JUSMAG compound. 193 Capt Yen, together with 
some FSRR radio operators, sent out communications in the name of 
MGen Cacanando. 194 

Apparently the transmitted misinformation was used to move troops 
stationed in the north. 195 One of the messages was addressed to BGen 
Marcelo Blando, CG 7 ID. 198 The rebel Rangers also broadcasted radio 
messages in the name ofMGen Cacanando, stating that the whole PA 
was fully supporting the rebel forces in their alleged effort to reform 
the political structure, and urging all Army units to contribute to the 
attainment of this objective. BGen Orlando Antonio, CG NOLCOM, 
received the radio message at about 8:00 a.m. of 1 December while he was 
aboard a Huey helicopter bound for Tarlac. However, he disregarded 
this message since no radio telephone contact with the HPA could be 
established for verification. It was instead referred to BGen Lisandro 
Abadia. 197 

Col llano said he sent Capt Abu and Capt Maclang to go around and 
try to obtain information about the Ranger's activities. Maclang and 
Abu wore rebel countersigns allegedly to be able to move freely. After the 
attempted coup, the two were relieved by MGen Cacanando. He also 
relieved Col llano of his command for the failure of his intelligence 
operations. 198 llano denied the imputation, claiming they were in fact 
able to establish the occurrence of the coup several hours before it 
began. 199 

Takeover of Vital Installations 

The Scout Rangers led by Capt Legiralde moved swiftly. Aside from 
during the HPA, AOC, the JUSMAG compound, Gates 1 and 2, they 
also attacked the 808th Custodial Company at the Army Detention 
1 2oo ter * Anrefi S nt ensued at the area, including the vicinity near Gate 
1- The Scout Rangers prevailed. They disarmed the personnel at the 
808th Custodial Company and released the 1987 coup detainees from 
™e detention center. 201 

The Scout Rangers also rushed to COMCENTER. They disarmed 
toe personnel there, including Capt Feliciano Fernandez, Commu- 
?<X nS Officer, PA Signal Group, who was in charge of the 
WMCENTER. An unidentified Ranger announced a coup d'etat, 
toe capture of AOC, G3 HQ, and the PALAR and instructed that 
tofcmunications and power lines be destroyed. However, Capt Fernandez 



268 



was able to negotiate and the Rangers agreed not to blow up the 
communications system; instead, they disconnected the telephone 
lines at the main distribution frame. 202 

By 2:00 a.m., the rebel Rangers had already taken control of 
HPA, AOC, COMCENTER, JUSMAG compound, the 808th Custodial 
Company, Gates 1, 2, 3, including the INP/NCRDC Field Force, 203 and 
the National Mapping and Resource Inventory Authority (NAMRIA) 
where they took the firearms of the security guards and nine vehicles 
which they used subsequently in transporting officers and hauling 
supplies and equipment. 204 

A group of about 20 Scout Rangers searched the quarters of key 
military officers including those of MGen Cacanando and BGen 
Cardones. 206 One company of Rangers led by 2Lts Raymundo Acorda 
and Angel Adrian Sievert arrived at Cacanando' s quarters and disarmed 
the guards assigned at the gate. The Rangers then made the guards drop 
to prone positions. Lt Estropia, who proceeded to Cacanando's quarters 
after leaving the AOC, talked to the Ranger officers and noting that 
Cacanando was not there, ordered them not to search his quarters. The 
Rangers obeyed and proceeded to man the JUSMAG. 206 

BGen Cardones was also not in his quarters when the Rangers 
arrived, since he was attending the Command Conference held by Gen 
de Villa at Camp Aguinaldo. When he returned to his office at the FSRR 
HQ in Fort Bonifacio, and upon hearing that Scout Rangers had taken 
over major points in Fort Bonifacio, he took temporary refuge in the 
quarters of Lt Col Javier. Cardones hid by the creek, staying there the 
whole night and then escaped by going over th e wall towards Dasmarinas 
Village. 207 

Build-up of Rebel Ranger Logistics 

After taking control of various vital facilities and locations in Fort 
Bonifacio, the Scout Rangers sought to acquire additional arms. The 
troops of both "B" Company and U CT Company, 1 SRB, FSRR were 
instructed to withdraw their M-16 rifles with magazines and 140 rounds 
of ammunition. 208 The rest of the 14 SR Coy based in Tagaytay City 
arrived in Fort Bonifacio by 4:30 a.m. of 1 December and stayed in the 
Liaison Office of the FSRR HQ. 209 

Later, they were called to formation and boarded a 6 x 6 truck with 
Lt Galvez and were brought to man Gate 2. 210 At 6:30 a.m. Lt Col 
Salvador Limsiaco, Chief of Staff of LABde, Lt Col Paypon of PAFC, Maj 



CHAPTER V 269 



Nescarito Ramos of SSBde and M^j Pablo Bayot of Gl, LABde were 
stopped by FSRR elements at Gate 2 on their way to their offices. They 
were made to board a white Land Cruiser of NAMRIA and they were 
brought under escort to the FSRR Officers Lounge where they were 
detained for 11 hours. 

Limsiaco later reported the presence at the lounge of officers who 
were not organic to the FSRR and were wearing rebel countersign 
patches, namely, Lt Col Franklin Brawner, Lt Col Iigot, Col Leopoldo 
Aliac, Capt Soriano.and Capt Cutiyog. Iigot, however, said that he had 
to wear the patch because otherwise he could not have left the AOC. 211 
He requested Col Sanchez and Capt Lim to allow him to go to his office, 
promising to return. He was then allowed to leave. 212 

Presence of BGen (Ret) Felix Brawner 

Limsiaco saw BGen (Ret) Felix Brawner, Jr and MGen (Ret) Jaime 
Echevarria, both in civilian attire, moving about freely in the area near 
the Officers Lounge. Limsiaco requested BGen Brawner to contact his 
(Limsiaco's) wife to assure her of his safety. 213 

By morning, Capt Lim and other Scout Ranger officers had gone to 
theAOC. 214 Col Dado and the rest of MGen Cacanando's staff were still 
beingheld there as hostages. Some of the rebels at the AOC, particularly 
UCol Galvez and Lts Adriatico and Tomas, tried to recruit him to join 
4e rebel cause. He refused. 216 In his testimony, Col Dado confirmed 
the presence of BGen Brawner in the area. ColParay, one of the officers 
hostaged at the AOC, stated that at about 10:00 a.m., BGen Brawner 
visited the AOC and spoke to him about the "importance of the armor" 
saying "if the rebels had them, this would hasten what they (the rebel 
Hangers) were doing." When Col Paray did not agree, BGen Brawner left 
and walked towards the HPA and there conversed with Col Sanchez and 
Maj Valencia. 216 By this time, the rebels had intensified their defense 
Position at the AOC by placing a V-150 and establishing lookouts and 
^emplacements at every corner of the AOC complex. 217 

Recruiting the Light Armor Brigade Commander 

Knowing the importance of the 

assets under the control of Col Paray, 
UCol Galvez, Valencia, Lim and other FSRR officers exerted efforts to 
Evince him to release the 4 LACS and place it under the FSRR Paray 
^d. Lim told him that some of his men had sent feelers wanting to 
Jwn therebels. While Paray was confident none ofhis men would join the 
'wels.he agreed to go to the 4 LACS area to ask for the stand ofhis men. 



270 I 

At 3:00 p.m., they proceeded to the 4 LACS compound and the personnel 
there immediately took defensive positions so that the Rangers couldnot 
approach them. Only Paray was allowed to step forward. He spoke to 
Capt Amado Contreras, Company Commander, who reaffirmed the 
company's position to follow orders only from Paray. Paray then went 
back to the Ranger officers and told them his unit would not join* 8 

Before the coup, as a precautionary measure, Paray instructed his 
men that if a coup occurs, the 4 LACS should obey only orders given ty 
him personally. 

Lim persisted in trying to convince Paray, who continued to refuse. 
In their heated argument, the former dropped the name of BGen Blando 
who he said was expected to arrive at the AOC by helicopter. 21 * There 
were also reports that a helicopter was sent in the morning to Fort 
Magsaysay to fetch Blando. The latter, however, did not arrive at AOC. 
M^j Purugganan was heard to ask "Bakit wala pa si Tatang OneT (Why 
is Tatang One not yet here). Among the Rangers, 'Tatang One" was the 
code name for Blando. 220 

Seeking Artillery Equipment 

Aside from the armor, the rebel Rangers also sought artillery 
equipment. At 9:00 a.m., Capt Constante Pante, Operations Officer of 
the Honor Guard Battalion (HGB) HHSG, PA, with a RAM-HF counter- 
sign placed on his left arm, went to the firebase (the place where the 105 
mm Howitzer guns were located), gave Capt Eugenio de los Santos, head 
of the Battery Command, six pieces of countersigns, and tried to convince 
the latter and his personnel to wear them. De los Santos refused. 

At 3:00 p.m., de los Santos saw Pante, Galvez, Lim, Soriano, Cutiyog 
and Paray at the 4 LACS area, which is beside the Battery Command. 
All except Col Paray were wearing countersigns, and Capt Pante said to 
the others "atin yan" referring to Capt de los Santos. At 11:30 p.m.» 
Pante returned to the firebase and approached de los Santos with a map 
and instructed him to compute the "data" of Camp Aguinaldo and 
Malacanang. As used in the military, "data" mean the calculations 
needed to aim the 105 mm Howitzers, which have a firing range of about 
1 1 kilometers. Both Camp Aguinaldo and Malacanang are well within 
the range. Pante also instructed de los Santos to "lay the guns," butde 
los Santos stalled, saying it was too late in the night. Pante, who claimed 
to be the new HGB Commander, allegedly threatened de los Santos that 
if he would not join the rebels he would be liquidated. 221 



CHAPTER V 271 



Regrouping of Rebel Rangers 

Failing to persuade the COs of the 4 LACS and the Artillery unit of 
HGB, the Rangers had to make do with only five armored vehicles which 
they took from the Maintenance Depot, and two platoons of the HGB. 222 
By this time, PAF jets had destroyed the rebel air assets in Sangley 
Point and BGen Blando had failed to arrive at Fort Bonifacio. The Scout 
Ranger officers sought to regroup. They left the AOC by early afternoon 
of 1 December. 223 Some of the hostaged government officers were released 
by that time. 224 At about 2:30 p.m., Capt Lim and Lt Col Galvez arrived 
at the COMCENTER and instructed its personnel to restore one hot line 
at the AOC to the FSRR headquarters and one local line at the AOC. 226 

At the FSRR Officers Lounge, Col Sanchez released Lt Col Limsiaco 
and M«g Bayot, but instructed for them not to leave the camp compound. 
The two reported to the LABde. 226 

By late afternoon, Sgt Logan of the monitoring team had reported 
that some Scout Rangers and AWOL soldiers numbering about 300 had 
been observed changing their white countersigns to red countersigns. 227 
The monitoring team under SSgt Oscar Obenia, HQ Intelligence 
Company, reported to the NCRDC Command Operations Center the 
sighting of 100 Scout Rangers in full combat gear aboard two V-150s 
and two 6x6 trucks moving from Fort Bonifacio towards Ayala Avenue 
andEDSA 228 

CAjc. 2 December 

Early in the morning, Lt Tomas and his security, wearing the RAM- 
HF countersign, arrived at the firebase and asked de los Santos to tow 
one 105 mm Howitzer to the AOC building. The latter refused and said 
that unless Col Dado or M^j Magday instructed him to do so, he would 
not comply. 229 

Shortly thereafter, Capt Pante arrived again and asked de los Santos 
to bring out the 105 mm Howitzers to defend Fort Bonifacio in case of an 
attack by government troops from SOLCOM. 230 De los Santos again 
refused. 

Government Troop Movements 

Between 8:00 to 10:00 a.m., the 4 LACS personnel maneuvered and 
redeployed all their armor vehicles away from the area near the firebase. 
They then consolidated at the LABde HQ to rescue the remaining 



272 



hostages at the AOC. 231 At the same time, the personnel at the HHSG, 
which is just across the AOC, began to take defensive positions. 2 " 

FSRR elements, noting the movement of the armor vehicles, alerted 
Maj Valencia; he then asked Col Paray to explain the 4 LACS movement 
The latter took this opportunity to request that he be allowed to leave 
AOC to meet the men. His request was granted and he went to the 
Brigade HQ to talk to his officers and men. He reminded themto remain 
loyal to the duly constituted government. He also wrote a note to BGen 
Lisandro Abadia regarding the situation which was delivered by courier. 283 

The maneuver of the 4 LACS which resulted in all the armor moving 
out of the firebase left the Howitzers of de los Santos without protection. 
To avoid having the artillery fall into rebel hands, de los Santos 
instructed his men to remove the firing pins of the 105 mm Howitzers, 
bury them in the nearby field, and to leave their post. 234 

Feelers for Negotiation 

By 9:00 a.m., the Scout Rangers at the AOC had received reports 
that General Headquarters was planning to stage an offensive operation 
against them, employing two brigades under the NCRDC. 235 This news 
led Capt Agdeppa to instruct his troops of "C" Company, 1 SEB, FSRR, 
to establish a defensive perimeter against government troopers. 236 By 
mid-morning, some Scout Rangers started abandoning their positions in 
Fort Bonifacio. At about 1 1:00 a.m., feelers for a dialogue were received 
by Cacanando shortly after Maj Valencia and Capt lim arrived at the 
AOC for this purpose. Col Dado held a short dialogue with the two. One 
of their requests was for the CG PA or G2 to call former CG PA MGen 
(Ret) Rodolfo Canieso of NICA and discuss some demands of the 
Rangers. 237 

In the meantime, Capts Yangzon and Gurrea slipped out of AOC 
through the back exit and established contact with the PA Battle Staff 
at HHSG. 238 They briefed Cacanando on the situation at the AOC. 2 * 
Gurrea and Yangzon returned to the AOC, informed Dado about their 
contact with Cacanando, and presented their escape plan in case the 
negotiations failed. Dado then went to see Cacanando. 240 The latter sent 
Col Urgello, who was designated as his official emissary, and Dado to 
talk with the rebel leaders of the Scout Rangers 241 to settle the matter 
peacefully. Col Sanchez, Lt Cols Galvez and Ochosa, Maj Valencia, 
Capts Lim, Yen, Pagulayan, Abuan, Cutiyog, Soriano and Tiamwatt, 
and Lts Tomas, Galvez and Adriatico met with Cols Urgello and Dado, 
Maj Magday, and Capts Gurrea and Yangzon at the G2 section of the 



CHAPTER V 273 



HHSG building. 242 Urgello revealed that Tomas was disgusted because 
he thought they were just being used in a power play. 243 

Capt Lim served as spokesman for the rebels. As a result of the 
negotiations, it was initially agreed that there would be no fighting 
inside Fort Bonifacio and that the rebels would recognize the authority 
of MGen Cacanando. They also agreed to assemble at HPA Grandstand 
for accounting of personnel and inventory of equipment 244 Lim, however, 
indicated that the matter must be cleared with Maj Purugganan, giving 
rise to the impression that Purugganan was the leader of the rebel Scout 
Rangers in Fort Bonifacio. 245 

At 1:00 p.m., as the rebel Rangers abandoned AOC, government 
troopers led by the Headquarters Intelligence Security Group 
(HISG) immediately secured the building. 248 The Rangers also left the 
C0MCENTER with instructions not to restore the communications 
system without their clearance. 247 At around 2:00 p.m., they started 
pulling out from the areas they occupied, as earlier agreed upon. 
However, instead of assembling at the HPA Grandstand, they consolidated 
at the Golf Club area near Gate 2 fronting McKinley Road at Forbes 
Park. 24 * About 350 rebel Rangers, excluding those who may have left 
earlier, under Maj Purugganan, Lt Col Galvez, and Capt Lim, instead of 
returning to barracks went to the Makatd Commercial Center. Some 66 
Rangers under Col Sanchez, Lt Col Ochosa and Maj Valencia returned 
to barracks. 240 

Retaking of Fort Bonifacio by Government Forces 

HPA personnel immediately took control of all vital installations in 
Fort Bonifacio 250 as soon as the rebel forces vacated the occupied areas 
in the camp. 

MGen Cacanando then directed the reorganization and consolidation 
of his forces to man designated areas including vital installations such 
as the AOC, HPA Building and COMCENTER. He directed HHSG to 
strengthen the security of Gates 1, 2, 3, the detention center, and the 
ammo dump. BGenCabanlig's Marines manned Gate 3. The Command 
Contingency Task Force was reorganized under Col Paray. Inventory of 
equipment and physical accounting of personnel were conducted by all 
Post unit commanders. 261 At the COMCENTER, Capt Fernandez ordered 
the restoration of normal operations and the inventory of all equipment, 
firearms and ammunition. 



274 



C.2. Movement of the Rangers to Makati 

It is not exactly clear why the rebel soldiers, contrary to prior 
agreement reached with Dado and Urgello, marched from Fort Bonifacio 
and occupied Makati's commercial district. The government forces did 
not anticipate the rebel seizure of Makati's tall buildings. When every- 
thing was over and done with, they theorized that it was simply a 
delaying tactic to allow rebel reinforcements to arrive and to prevent 
additional government forces from assisting the defenders of Camp 
Aguinaldo. 252 

On the other hand, the Mayor of Makati, Jejomar Binay, called it 
a "last ditch" stand taken by the rebels who had been defeated at Fort 
Bonifacio. 253 

In an interview with rebel-at-large Maj Purugganan conducted 
by journalist Sheila Coronel of the Philippine Center for Investigative 
Journalism on 14 January 1990, Purugganan said that Makati 
Commercial Center figured in the planning prior to the December 1 
activity as a defensive fallback position. Said Maj Purugganan: "Now, 
if you will take note, "there are I think more than 40 embassies there and 
... 109 multinational centers in Makati. And that position, if you will 
be able to occupy that, and lookingfrom other areas adjacent . . . the place 
is like a fortress. And controlling that area is practically controlling the 
whole of Makati." 254 

The Makati takeover was a very costly incident. lives were lost; 
property was destroyed; the tourism industry suffered a very serious 
blow; and for several days the financial life of Metro Manila, and to a 
considerable extent of the entire country, was paralyzed. 

C.2.a. 1 December 

Although various reports indicated rebel presence in the Makati 
Commercial Center on 1 December, nothing foretold the events that 
were to occur the following day. At around noon, ex-Lt Col Honasan was 
sighted at the Coffee Shop of the Hotel Intercontinental Manila 
(Intercon). 255 In the early evening, DZRH reported rebels pulling out of 
the PLDT Building, in Legazpi Village. 

Commo Calajate dropped off Navy Capt Ison from his beige staffcar, 
somewhere along PasongTamo Street sometime around 7:30 p.m. From 
there Ison proceeded to his sister's house in Quezon City where, sometime 



CHAPTER V 275 



later, he was picked up by the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) personnel 
after surrendering to Commo Pio Garrido, Jr, PCG Commandant. 256 

02.b. 2 December 

Things began to stir by midmorning. At about 10:00 a.m., reports 
were received by Mayor Binay that about 20 rebel soldiers, riding in four 
private vehicles, were converging at the area around the Intercon 267 
where ameetingof the Central tor^ 

Party (NP) was scheduled to be held at 1:30 p.m., to be followed by a press 
conference at about 3:00 p.m. 258 

Evidence received by the Commission disclosed that sometime 
between 9:30 and 10:00 a.m., Amy Castillo from the Office of Vice 
President Laurel called up Emelinda Santos, Banquet Coordinator of 
the Hotel Intercontinental (Intercon), and reserved the Dasmarinas 
Room for 30 to 35 persons. 269 The charges for the room and the snacks 
served amounted to 1*3,715.00. It was paid for in cash and covered by 
an official receipt numbered 399281, dated 2 December 1989, made out 
to the Nacionalista Party. 260 

As early as 1:00 p.m. rebel soldiers were seen massing at the corner 
of Ayala Avenue and EDSA. About 30 Army troopers were scattered on 
the sidewalk beside the Hotel Intercontinental and in the car park 
behind. An armored personnel carrier was parked at the sidewalk along 
Ayala Avenue north of the Intercon. 261 

The NP CENCOM Meeting started as scheduled at 1:30 p.m. Although 
the press conference was scheduled to follow only later at 3:00 p.m., 
media people came early so that the meeting of the CENCOM was also 
covered by the media. 262 The press conference ended by 4:00 p.m. 

It is not clear at what time the rebels first entered the Intercon; 
whether it was before or during the Nacionalista Party press conference. 
Newsman Ramon Isberto declared that he saw no uniformed soldier 
inside or in front of the Intercon during the press conference; but Mayor 
frnay testified receiving reports saying that the hotel's elevators were 
manned by rebel soldiers. Gloria Diaz, who was at the coffee shop of the 
h <>tel testified that the rebel soldiers entered the hotel lobby, "after 
tanch, merienda time." 263 

The exact time for the entry of the rebels could have been easily 
pointed had two hotel officials, Chief of Security Pedro G. Rojo, 264 and 
Rodent Manager Jean Pierre Etroit, 2 * who were most of the time in the 



276 



lobby of the hotel, during this period, been either more observant, or 
more cooperative as witnesses. 

Etroit, liberally embellished his testimony with "I don't know" or "it 
is difficult to say" and other vague responses. To the question "can you 
tell us more or less in the evening what time they [rebel soldiers] went 
into the hotel?" he simply replied: "It was still light outside, so I believe 
5:00, 6:00 or 5:30, something*. 266 

Rojo, whose office was located at the ground floor of the hotel, 
claimed twice before the Commission (first on 1 March and then on 25 
June 1990) that he learned of the Nacionalista Party press conference, 
which was held on 2 December, only on 6 December 1990 and from a 
television news report at that. He averred 

As far as I can recall on December 2, 1989, regarding the presence of soldiers, 
all I can say was on or about 6:00 in the evening of December 2 that was the only 
time that a grou p of soldiers entered the hotel lobby and asked me where the way 
to the second floor was. But before that time all I can remember was there were 
really soldiers but not inside the lobby but outside the hotel.**' 

The firmnessby which he clearly remembered 6:00 p.m. , however, is 
a stark contrast to his recollection of his whereabouts between noontime 
and 6:00 p.m. He said 

I cannot exactly say where I am between that time but Tm sure Tm in the 
hotel. 1 " 

In any case, it was established that at about 2:00 p.m., around 500 
Scout Rangers had entered the Makati Commercial Center and began 
the occupation of the area. 269 Part of the group headed by Capt Lim 
entered the Intercon around 3:00 p.m. 270 Another group led by Galvez 
proceeded to the parking lot behind the hotel and then went to Twin 
Towers where they stayed most of the time. 271 

In quick succession, and meeting very little resistance, the rebels 
set up their positions in 22 buildings and establishments in the Makati 
Commercial Center. 272 

By about 3 :30 p.m. , DZRH reported the presence of snipers in almost 
all of the tall buildings in the commercial center, notably the Twin 
Towers, the Hotel Nikko Garden (Nikko), the Intercon Hotel and the 
PCIB building.™ 



CHAPTER V 277 



GHQ AFP could hot immediately send its own reaction forces since 
Camp Aguinaldo was still under attack from the rebel forces at the 
White Plains area under Lt Col Gojo. 274 Instead, MGen Montano 
assigned the task of confronting the rebels at Makati principally to the 
available units of the PC 275 under BGen Aguirre, who was at Camp 
Bagong Diwa waiting for instruction to go to Camp Aguinaldo and assist 
in its defense. 276 The government forces, composed of elements of PC 
Lagunaunder Lt Col Edgar Aglipay, PC Batangas under Lt Col Regalado, 
and the Regional Special Action Force of RECOM 4 (RSAF 4), and an 
assault force of MPFF under P/Lt Col Romeo Maganto supported by 
SWAT teams, left Camp Bagong Diwa at about 3:45 p.m. They arrived 
at Makati at about 4:00 p.m. 277 

The MPFF, composed of 92 enlisted men, in full battle gear encamped 
atUgarte Field, established a blockingforce at the intersection of EDSA 
andPasay Road, and positioned troops along the left lane of EDSA (going 
to Quezon City) fronting San Lorenzo Village. 278 

Upon its arrival, the Laguna PC deployed its units. Elements of the 
RSAF 4 and the 229 PC Coy under Capt Rodolfo de Garcia established 
an advance command post near the intersection of Ayala Avenue and 
Herrera Street. The 223 PC Coy under Maj Ismael Rafanan and PHQ 
elements under Capt Ricardo Marquez conducted reconnaisance at the 
vicinity of the Mandarin Hotel and along Makati Avenue. The 224 PC 
Coy under Capt Felipe Buena occupied various buildings at the inter- 
section of Ayala Avenue and Paseo de Roxas. The 226 PC Coy under Capt 
Leo Kison augmented the Batangas PC command at the corner of Pasong 
Tamo and Pasay Road while the 228 PC Coy under Capt Luisito Palmera 
occupied de la Rosa Street. 279 

To prevent loss of civilian lives and to minimize possible damage to 
property, the government forces decided to retake Makati from the 
rebels "block by block, building by building . . . sniper to sniper." 280 The 
general plan was to slowly constrict the area under rebel control until the 
rebels realize that, having been surrounded by a superior force, it was 
time to give up. 281 

Although initially the government forces were not as heavily armed 
as the rebels, they nevertheless were able to chalk up some immediate 
successes. 

At 5:40 p.m. DZRH reported that the Paseo de Roxas and the Makati 
weenbelt areas were clear of rebels but the glass walls and doors of the 
Interbank Building were shattered. 282 At around 7:00 p.m., elements of 



278 



the 15 RSAF 4 occupied the Pacific Star Building at the corner of Makati 
and Sen Gil Puyat Avenues as the rebels retreated towards the 
Mandarin Oriental Hotel (Mandarin). 283 DZBB reported a stalemate at 
Ayala Avenue, 384 while DZXL reported that there was sporadic firing 
going on at about 9:40 p.m. at the other end of Paseo de Roxas and at 
the corner of EDSA and Ayala Avenue. 286 At 10:00 p.m. government 
troops attacked the rebels occupying the PCIB Building. 286 

The day ended with government forces suffering some casualties. At 
about 11:30 p.m., while some MPFF elements were with Patrolman 
Macalino and a certain G. Mojica, a civilian police aide, checking their j 
road block near San Lorenzo Village, rebels riding a dirty-white Hi-Ace 
van came by and opened fire killing Macalino and Mojica and wounding 
Maganto. The latter, after instructing P/Capt Renato Valeria to take 
over the operations, was rushed together with other casualties to the 
Makati Medical Center. Reinforcements from the RSAF 4 arrived and 
positioned themselves at the overpass infront of Mantrade. 287 

C.2«c. 3 December 

At 4:00 a.m. on orders of the Commander of the Task Force Makati, 
the MPFF pulled out of their roadblocks and returned to the Command 
Post to provide perimeter security. The troops were divided into three 
teams: one team under Capt Valeria was deployed in the vicinity of the 
Sean Philip Building; another, under P/Capt Vicente Vargas at the 
Makati Fire Central Station ; and the third, under P/Lt Jose Rayco at the 
Makati Medical Center. 288 

At about 8:30 a.m., the elements from the 15 RSAF 4, under Capt 
Ronald Sabug and Capt Philmore Balmaceda, occupied and secured the 
DBP Building. 

At 9:30 a.m., 15 RSAF, four elements encountered rebels at Ayala 
Avenue. One V-150 of the government was hit by rebel anti-tank 
weapons. Two enlisted men were killed and Capt Tagaca and five other 
members of his assault group were wounded. 289 Shortly there-after, VI 
LtNelson Yabut was also wounded as rebels fired their 90mmrecoilless 
rifles while he was boarding the V-150. Finally, at 10:45 a.m., a V-150 
was neutralized by rebel soldiers while it was on a reconnaissance 
mission at the corner of EDSA and Ayala Avenue. 

BGen Aguirre believed the rebels had M an oversupply of sophisticated 
communication ... not [of the kind] from the basic supplies of the 
military" which were able to jam the radios of the government troops. 290 



CHAPTER V 279 



At 2:00 p.m., MGen Montano ordered the Task Force Makati to 
assault any target where the presence of Honasan is confirmed. 291 

About 3:00 p.m., elements of the Eastern Sector Command under Col 
Jewel Can son, Rizal PC Commander, arrived at the Makati Advance 
Command Post to reinforce the government troops at the corner of Paseo 
de Roxas and Puyat Avenue. 292 

At about 4 : 00 p.m. 3 December, a BO- 105 helicopter with tail number 
RP 183 belonging to the PC Aviation Group, piloted by Lt Col Alfredo 
Silapan with Capts Tito Ticman and Dante delos Trinos, and under the 
guidance of Lt Col Meynardo Carpio, CO PC RIU, took off from the 
CAPCOM helipad and proceeded to the Makati area. The helicopter 
maneuvered over Fort Bonifacio and delivered several rounds of 50 cal 
HMG fire at the rebels located at the multi-level parking lot behind 
the Intercon. On its second and third attempts, the helicopter gun 
malfunctioned forcing the aircraft to return to CAPCOM headquarters. 293 

At about 5:30 p.m., shortly after elements from the Rizal PC arrived 
at the Task Force Makati Advance Command Post, a convoy of three 
cars wandered into a no-man's land in the area of Makati Avenue by 
the DBP Building and was met with heavy rebel fire. One car had to 
be abandoned; two security personnel and BGen Aguirre were wounded. 294 

Close to midnight, the 1st Marine Brigade moved its tactical command 
post from the corner of EDSA and Boni Serrano Avenue to the area 
between Ayala Avenue and Pasay Road, to act as a blocking force. 296 

At an undetermined time, Pedro Samatela, a security supervisor of 
the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, and Jesus Nava, an 
assistant, were executed by the rebels who occupied the building. This 
was recorded in the firm's closed circuit television, unfortunately, the 
perpetrators could not be identified through the video tapes. 296 

C.2.d. 4 December 

At8:00a.m.,thegovernmenttroopsfromthe 15 RSAF 4 occupied I the 
Mandarin. 297 At 10:00 a.m., elements from the PC Batangas had an 
encounter with rebel soldiers at the vicinity of Gibson's at the Landmark 
Building. 298 

With the Mandarin in government hands, troopers of the 15 RSAF 
4 exchanged fire with the rebels at the Grand Atrium, PCIB and UCPB 
Buildings. 299 Meanwhile, at the Rustan Commercial Corporation's store 



280 



at Ayala Avenue, rebels sought permission from Rustan's Security 
Chief, PC Col (Ret) Virgilio Poblete to plant snipers on top of Rustan's 
Building. Poblete was able to dissuade them from doing so. Instead, at 
the request of the rebels, he gave them two cases of sardines and a case 
of coffee. 300 

At 3:00 p.m., Gen de Villa, on account of feelers received from the 
rebels that they wanted to talk to BGen Arturo Enrile, PMA 
Superintendent, called the latter to Camp Aguinaldo to establish contact 
with the rebels. From Camp Aguinaldo at 11 p.m., BGen Enrile was able 
to establish telephone contact with Lt Col Galvez at the Tuscany. The 
latter informed the former that they, the rebels, intended to hold on until 
President Aquino resigned or until they died in the process. At 11:45 
p.m., contact was also made with a certain Lt Dario at the Twin Towers. 
BGen Enrile impressed on him the futility of further resistance and 
asked that he be allowed to talk directly to the rebel group. Lt Dario said 
he would inform their leader. 

During the night, the Mandarin hired a fleet of taxis and safely 
evacuated its guests. 301 

At about midnight, PMAR troops under BGen Cesar Abella, after 
conducting patrols at the Forbes Park area, arrived at the Task Force 
Makati Command Post. They were deployed along Paseo de Roxas, 
Pasay Road, Ayala Avenue, EDS A vicinity Mantrade, and McKinley 
Road. 302 

C.2.e. 5 December 

At 1:00 a.m., the 2nd Marine Battalion Landing Team (MBLT2) 
established a blocking position at McKinley Road together with the 
Command Group, 1st Marine Brigade (1 MBde) which had its tactical 
command post at the San Antonio Arcade. 303 Heavy fighting occurred 
very early in the morning. The Marines at McKinley Road, at about 2:00 
a.m., were fired upon by the rebels posted at the high-rise buildings in 
the commercial center. The firefight lasted for two hours. 304 At about 
4:30 a.m., rebel snipers at Nikko also engaged the MBLT 2 at the corner 
of Pasay Road and Palm Avenue. 305 An encounter occurred at 5:00 a.m. 
between the rebels and the 2 Marine Coy MBLT 2 at the multi-level car 
park behind Intercon. Twelve government troopers were wounded. 308 

At 6 a.m., the 15 RSAF 4 troopers under Lt Leodegardio Regis and 
Lt Rogelio Moral attacked the Gran d Atrium under coveringfire provided 
by the team commanded by Capt Romeo Sabug. 307 



CHAPTER V 281 



While all this fighting was going on, the Department of Tourism, 
between 4:00 to 6:00 a.m., established contact with the rebels through 
feelers from the rebels wanting to find out whether the Department was 
really acting in good faith in seeking; the safe evacuation of tourists 
trapped in the hotels controlled by the rebels. At around 9:00 a.m., 
Tourism Undersecretary Rafael Alunan, with an announcer of DZAM 
acting as intermediary, received a call from Maj Purugganan who 
wanted to hear directly from Alunan about the government's intentions. 
After a brief discussion, the evacuation was agreed to in principle, and 
with the assurance from Maj Purugganan that they were ready to open 
the gates of Makati at 10:00 a.m., Alunan agreed to meet with the rebels 
in an hour at the Petron Station outside the Dasmarinas Village gate on 
Pasay Road. Because it took some time to mobilize buses, Alunan got to 
the meeting place only at about 11:00 a.m. By then he was told that the 
evacuation would not push through because the rebels complained of 
"intermittent firing*. Alunan was advised to settle the matter with 
BGen Aguirre. 

The intermittent firing complained about must have been the 
firefight at the Grand Atrium at about 6:00 a.m., when the 15 RSAF 4 
troopers attacked, and at 10:00 a.m. when the rebel snipers fired again 
at the Marines on Pasay Road. 308 

At any rate, Undersecretary Alunan with Tourism Secretary Peter 
Garrucho, personally went to the Headquarters of BGen Aguirre and 
asked for the troops to cease firing. Aguirre gave them 30 minutes, 
extendable upon request, to iron out the details with the rebels. Aguirre 
agreed also to give two hours for the actual evacuation of the tourists. 

At about the time that the Tourism officials were negotiating with 
the rebels, BGen Enrile, together with volunteer-negotiators, Lt Col 
Edilberto Adan, Capt Ricardo Morales, Lt Jose Manuel Faune, Lt 
Clemente Enrique and Capt Arturo Ang, all of the Philippine Army, 
proceeded to the FSRR Headquarters to gather information about the 
rebels. There they were informed by BGen (Ret) Emilio Luga that he 
was also able to establish telephone contact with Galvez, Purugganan 
and Iim at the Intercon. Enrile accordingly invited Luga to join the 
negotiating team. 

Garrucho and Alunan returned to EDSA to meet with Purugganan 
only to find that they were at the Intercon being interviewed by the 
media. After thirty minutes of mingling with rebel soldiers at Nikko, 
Garrucho and Alunan were invited to meet with the rebels at the 
Intercon. After an hour and a half of discussions, the negotiations 



282 



■?3 



encountered a hitch as the rebels demanded that the government troops 
should move back one kilometer from all sides. Since that was a military 
issue, the talks were suspended and both parties agreed to meet again 
the following morning. 

It must be pointed out that even while the negotiations were going 
on, sniping from both sides continued. Garrucho noted that he was at 
one point so close to the shooting that he personally saw a guy on a 
motorbike get hit during one of the exchanges. 309 

By about 3:30 p.m., a portion of the Insular life Building caught fire 
after being hit by rebel mortar. Nevertheless, by this time, about seven 
buildings had already been retaken from the rebels. 310 There was one 
incident of intense firing at about 4:00 p.m., with the government 
suffering one casualty, Pfc Acosta. 311 Heavy sniper fire harassed the 
Marines who did not fire back. 312 At about 5:50 p.m., the combined forces 
of the government captured the Grand Atrium as the rebels retreated to 
the Manila Peninsula and the Makati Tuscany. 313 

Two rebel soldiers, Pvt Clarito Bongo and Pvt Mario Anos, trying to 
escape in civilian clothes and under cover of darkness, were intercepted 
at 7:00p.m. along Ayala Avenue 314 Anhour later, MPFF elements were 
dispatched on orders of the Task Force Makati Commander to secure the 
BPI Building and others along Ayala Avenue. The MPFF troops were 
divided into three groups: one, under P/Lt Rayco which secured the 
Philbanking Building; another group under P/Capt Santos took the 
Banco Filipino Building and the third under P/Capt Vargas took the new 
Makati multi-level car park. 315 

Ceasefire was announced at 8:00 p.m. 

At 9:00 p.m., Lt Col Galvez called to ask for the evacuation of their 
two wounded soldiers to the Fort Bonifacio General Hospital. To prove 
the government's sincerity, the request was granted and the two wounded 
rebels were picked up by a Red Cross Ambulance at about 9:45 p.m. 
Upon being informed by BGen Enrile, Lt Col Galvez agreed to consider 
Enrile's proposal for them to return to barracks. He also promised to call 
back Enrile. At 11:45 p.m., an unidentified caller told Enrile that the 
rebel officers were ready to receive him at Nikko. In response, Enrile 
asked the caller to contact the Chief of Staff by phone and thereafter 
call him. 



CHAPTER V 283 



At 12:00 midnight, the 1st Marine Brigade established a blocking 
force at vantage points in EDSA at the corners of McKinley and Pasay 
Road. 316 

C.2J. 6 December 

Fifteen minutes after midnight, BGen Enrile was again contacted by 
the unidentified caller, who claimed that deVillahad been contacted and 
that the rebels were waiting for him at Hotel Nikko. With the clearance 
from de Villa, the government negotiators left Fort Bonifacio at about 
1:20 a.m. in two private cars owned by BGen Enrile and a certain Capt 
Pangilinan. They passed through the Dasmarifias gate and then to 
Nikko. Galvez, Purugganan, Lim and five other members of the rebel 
group were waiting for them at the hotel lobby. It was revealed at this 
time that , the contacts made by the unidentified caller were arranged 
by Galvez. 

At 2:15 a.m., BGen Enrile reported to de Villa that he and the 
negotiating team had established face-to-face contact with the rebels, 
who agreed to release all the hotel occupants and residents of the rebel- 
controlled buildings at daylight. De Villa ordered a total ceasefire 317 and 
prohibited troop movements. 318 At about 4:00 a.m., de Villa advised 
Garrucho to bring the evacuation buses to the Makati Commercial 
Center at about 6:30 a.m. 

Negotiations specifically for the return to barracks started at 2:45 
a.m. After twohours, the parties decided to recess and resume negotiations 
after the evacuation. 

The guests in the occupied hotels and the residents of the condominium 
buildings under rebel control started leaving the area at about 7:00 a.m. 
Some 20 tourist buses under the supervision of Tourism Secretary 
Garrucho and Undersecretaries Narzalina Lim and Alunan were made 
available for evacuation. Alunan, who had the opportunity of meeting 
with Galvez and Purugganan during the evacuation, observed that 
Galvez looked demoralized, except when he was talking to media. He 
described Maj Purugganan as "gung-ho." 319 He further told the 
Commission that while the evacuation was going on, he heard from 
foreign journalists that Alona Alegre, aknown Marcos loyalist, was seen 
at the top of the Intercon wearing a red cross uniform together with some 
armed persons dressed as civilians. 320 

From Nikko, the government tourism officials proceeded to the 
Intercon, then to the Manila Peninsula Hotel, and the other buildings 



284 



thereafter. 321 At about 11:00 a.m., the evacuation of about 878 guests 
and civilians was completed. 322 Most of them were brought to the Fiesta 
Shopping Center Complex near the NALA 

Things were not, however, at a standstill on the military side. 
Garrucho reported that just before he left Makati after the evacuation, 
he saw a Fiera-type vehicle transporting ammunition to the rebels at the 
Intercon. 323 

Enrile sought to resume negotiations with the rebels but was 
unsuccessful on account of continued rebel complaints about govern- 
ment troop movements. Talks were formally resumed at 4:00 p.m., and 
continued on and off until about 8:00 p.m. 

At about the same time the 15 RSAF 4 were occupying the Manila 
Peninsula Hotel, the rebels were consolidating their forces at the PLDT, 
Allied Bank, Ritz Tower and Twin Towers. 324 

Finally, after the rebels were informed by BGen Enrile that they had 
only up to midnight to finish their negotiations, an agreement for a 
return to barracks was reached at about 8:00 p.m. However, it was 
agreed that no media announcements would be made until the next day. 
The rebels were to remove the mines they had planted in the area during 
the night. 325 Purugganan was not present during the last phase of the 
negotiations. It was learned later that he slipped out just before the final 
talks. 

C.2.g. 7 December 

After arrangements were made for the turnover of the buildings to 
the PA soldiers and the safe passage of the returning rebels to Fort 
Bonifacio, BGen Enrile ordered their return to barracks at 7:00 a.m. 

By 8:30 a.m., the rebels came out of their positions in the still 
occupied buildings — PLDT, Allied Bank, Ritz Towers and Twin Towers. 
Shortly thereafter, the government forces at the Pacific Star, the 
Mandarin, PCIB, UCPB and the Grand Atrium buildings advanced and 
conducted mopping up operations to make sure that the buildings were 
free of mines. Afterwards, the buildings were turned over to the civilian 
security guards to prevent looting and other untoward incidents. 326 

On their way back to Fort Bonifacio, the rebels were able to project 
before the television cameras and the onlookers at the sidewalks a 
victorious image. At about 3:00 p.m., the government held a Makati 



CHAPTER V 285 



victory parade for the forces that defended the Constitution and the 
duly constituted authorities. 

C.3. Philippine Marines Headquarters, Fort Bonifacio 
C.3.a. 30 November 

Doubtful Red Alert 

At about noon, BGen Eduardo Cabanlig, Commandant PMAR, 
claimed that he instructed all units, including the Marine Battalion 
LandingTeam 4 (MBLT4) under Maj Cesar de la Pefia, to go on red alert. 
He said he sensed unusual happenings. He learned on 28 November 
from the Marines, who were training with the Scout Rangers at Fort 
Bonifacio, that their graduation was postponed because they were to 
move to Pangasinan. Then, in the morning of 30 November, YOU posters 
were noticed along EDSA and in the Makati area. At that time too, he 
was informed of the Command Conference called by the CSAFP to be 
held at 5:30 p.m. in Camp Aguinaldo 327 

It appears, however, that the instruction was not implemented. In 
the list of red alert declarations from 1 September 1987 to 1 December 
1989 for the Philippine Marines HQ submitted by the Assistant Chief of 
Staff for Operations PMAR, Lt Col Armenio Cristal, Jr, 328 no red alert 
was declared on 30 November 1989. The last was on 3 November which 
was downgraded on 13 November. 

BGen Cabanlig attended the Command Conference in Camp 
Aguinaldo where they were briefed of the impending coup which was to 
occur at 2:00 a.m. the following day. Thereafter, he returned to his HQ 
and upon arriving at his HQ at 10:30 p.m., he immediately held a 
conference among his officers. 329 The conference was attended by Capt 
Jonathan Martir, Operations Officer of the MBLT 4, and other officers 
of the battalion namely, Capt Basilio Calimag, EX-O; Capt Romualdo 
Gualdrapa; Capt Ben Chavez, Logistics Officer; Capt Celestino Ferrera, 
Intelligence Officer; Capt Santos Petalio, a company commander, and 
other junior officers. BGen Cabanlig briefed the officers about the 
impending coup 330 and instructed Capt Calimag to prepare the MBLT 
4 to move to Camp Aguinaldo (LOGCOM/NCRDC) HQ because Maj de 
la Pena had not yet reported having been on "pass* since 25 November. 

Interestingly, according to Cabanlig, Lt Col Gojo, a relative of 
Honasan, was also on leave for 15 days before the coup attempt allegedly 
because of family problems. 



286 



Meeting of Marine Officers 

After the meeting, they went back to the Battalion HQ. Capt Martir 
was surprised to see three officers and 12 enlisted personnel who were 
not organic to the battalion. These officers were Capt Ariel Querubin of 
the Western Command (WESCOM), Capt Jaime Napoles of LOGCOM 
and Capt Juancho Sabban of SUBCOM. 331 

Querubin and Sabban, who were Martins classmates at the PMA, 
were involved in the 28 August 1987 coup attempt. With Kapunan, they 
attempted to bring down to Manila from Baguio the PMA cadets to 
support Honasan. These non-organic officers had with them VHF radios 
which were not a regular issue of the Marines. Querubin tried to 
convince Calimag not to move yet and just to wait because if he moved 
to LOGCOM or NCRDC HQ, he would be pulverized by artillery fire as 
the Army artillery were already pointed towards GHQ (meaning Camp 
Aguinaldo). Calimag said that his unit would follow the chain of 
command and would move. Querubin was furious; Calimag turned 
around and told Martir to find out how many men they have and to start 
arming some of their personnel within the battalion quarters for there 
may be a firefight to stop them from moving. 332 

Martir moved to his section (S3) and instructed his operations chief, 
MSgt Fortes, to direct all personnel to go to the armory and get their 
issued firearms and prepare for a possible firefight. While he was giving 
instructions, Martir saw the personnel of the intelligence unit (S2) 
already wearing white patches on their left shoulders; he already 
doubted that Capt Querubin had actually controlled some of the MBLT 
4 officers. When he was about to confront those wearing patches, Capt 
Ferrera entered the room with an Ultimax weapon and machinegun* 
and proceeded directly to the quarters. Martir, who followed him with 
Calimag, confronted Ferrera and asked why he did not say that he was 
committed to YOU during the conference with Cabanlig. Ferrera, 
answered that he is not YOU and "this is another thing and it is the 
instruction of their Battalion Commander" (referring to de la Pena). 
Calimag just remained quiet. 

When Martir went out, he saw de la Pena who looked haggard and 
tired. It turned out that he arrived from Iloilo at 7:00 p.m. that day but 
he proceeded to his Antipolo residence. Martir told him that Querubin 
and Sabban came to convince Calimag who did not give in. De la Pena 
instructed Martir to call all officers of the battalion for a conference. De 
la Pefta went to the radio room and directed the radio man to announce 



CHAPTER V 287 



through the public address system for all officers to proceed to .his office 
for a conference. 333 

Martir returned to the office of de la Pena where he saw him and 
Calimag talking; de la Pena told Martir to lock the doors and to join 
them. Just as he had seated, there was a loud knock on the door. When 
he opened it, he saw Lt Col Gojo who pushed the door, proceeded to where 
Maj de la Pena was, extended to him his right hand and said, "Cesar, 
'yung pinag-usapan natin 1 * (Cesar, don't forget what we had discussed). 
De la Pena stared at Gojo who had with him a VHF radio and extended 
to him his hand. De la Pefia walked towards the quarters with Martir 
and Calimag. When asked by Martir, "Sir, ano ba itoT (Sir, what is 
this?), de la Pena did not answer but merely reiterated his instructions 
to call all officers for a conference. 334 

While the officers were entering the office of de la Pena for the 
conference, Capt Petalio was seen holding a bunch of countersigns 
similar to those of the S2 personnel. Martir also saw Lt Rolando Cal, 
another company commander who was holding a radio similar to that of 
Gojo. De la Pena asked the officers to follow the tanks wherever they 
would go. Martir told de la Pena that his order is in opposition to that 
of the Commandant; but the latter insisted that they should follow the 
tanks. He told de la Pena "hindi ako puede diyan, sir" (I can't go along 
with your plan, Sir). He went to his office and got his cal .45 pistol and 
M-16 rifle. Before he was able to report to Cabanlig what happened, de 
la Pena approached him and said that they are still friends. 336 

At about 11:30 p.m., just before Martir arrived at the office of his 
Commandant, BGen Biazon called up BGen Cabanlig and requested for 
PMAR 6x6 trucks to ferry the elements of MBLT 4 to Camp Aguinaldo 
to be escorted by CAPCOM mobile cars. Col Millena, Logistics Officer 
PMAR, called up the motor pool to prepare all available trucks to ferry 
the troops and one 60 RR mounted on an M151 truck to be attached to 
the MBLT 4. However, BGen Biazon called up again to get confirmation 
if MBLT 4 had joined the coup because when he called up MBLT 4 to 
direct them to intercept two truckloads of unidentified soldiers at the 
South Expressway, he was informed that "Bumaliktad na kamC 336 (We 
We joined the rebels). 

At about midnight, Cabanlig talked to the Marine trainees; he 
learned later that when they marched back to their barracks with their 
officer-in-charge, Capt Castillo, rebel officer Lt Liwag pointed a gun at 
Castillo and Liwag was able to persuade 7 1 of the more than 200 trainees 
to join him. 337 



288 



At this point, Martir arrived at Cabanlig* s office to inform the latter 
that the MBLT 4 was committed to YOU and reported on what transpired 
at the MBLT 4 Headquarters. Cabanlig was surprised; he ordered his 
Aide-de-camp, Lt Romeo Tanalgo, to call de la Pefia by telephone. No 
contact was made as the lines were busy. Cabanligorderedhis Operations 
Officer, Col Salazar, to block the gates and not to allow the MBLT 4 to 
go out. Salazar then directed the placement of barricades and ordered 
the MP detachment to stop the MBLT 4 from getting out. 338 

C3.b. 1 December 

Since his Aide-de-camp failed to contact Maj de la Pefia, Cabanlig 
sent the Intelligence Officer of the PMAR, Col Buenaventura, to try to 
convince Lt Col Gojo, and for the MBLT 4 to desist from participating 
in the coup. 339 In his testimony, however, Cabanlig stated that he sent 
his Intelligence Officer to meet Maj de la Pefia. At two minutes past 
midnight, while his Intelligence Officer was on his way, four LVTs and 
two V- 150s followed by troops numbering about 200 rammed Gate 3 and 
left for VAB. There were, however, elements of the unit still being 
formed and so Cabanlig ordered Buenaventura and MSgt Renato 
Villanueva to talk to them. These elements told them that they have 
"crossed their bridges" and that they are leaving the camp. 340 

Mobilization of Marine Units 

Evidence further discloses that by late afternoon of 30 November, 
the Marine officers had already started to mobilize the MBLT 4 based in 
Fort Bonifacio. Sworn statements by Marine enlisted personnel show 
that many of them were ordered to mobilize on the evening of 30 
November without knowing that the action was intended for a coup. The 
. troops were moved to different locations. One enlisted personnel 
narrated his experience 

An armed man in fatigue uniform bearing no nameplate arrived at the 
Headquarters of the Philippine Marinea (PMAR HQ) and ordered the drill 
inspector to order the men to withdraw their rifles. Hence, firearms were issued 
and troop formation was done in front of the station of tanks at the PMAR HQ." 1 

The Marine troopers were informed that they will be participating 
in the "Balikatan Exercise" at Subic Base. 342 There was a consolidation 
of a large number of Marine troops by early evening of 30 November. 
Later, the troops of MBLT 4 were ordered to assemble in front of Brown 
Hall of the Marine HQ. 343 The company commanders were instructed to 
report to de la Pefia and Calimag. 344 These were the troops which were 



CHAPTER V 289 



ordered to move out of Fort Bonifacio and to proceed to occupy VAB by 
late evening. 346 

The 34 Marine Company (MC) of MBLT 4 was directed by its CO, Lt 
Cal, to pack-up for the following day's Exercise Balikatan. The troops 
then fell in with their firearms and proceeded to Gate 3 of Fort Bonifacio. 
There, Cal and his men boarded a ten- wheeler truck which brought them 
toPTV-4. 34 * 

At about 4:00 a.m. of 1 December, Cabanlig went out of Gate 3 and 
got in touch with some commercial radio patrol units like DZRH, DZEC 
and DZMM. He announced to the Marines through the radio that he was 
for the government. He told them not to be deceived by any of the officers 
and asked them to march back to camp. 347 

In the afternoon of 1 December, Cabanlig sent Col Romeo Daranchang, 
PMAR Chief of Staff, with Lt Col Jose Cordero and Capt Andayan to VAB 
to convince the Marines to go back. Daranchang was able to talk to Gojo, 
who appeared to be the one "calling the shots.* However, Gojo refused 
saying "they have burned their bridges.'' 343 

Cabanlig devoted the whole day of 1 December to the consolidation 
of his forces. He was able to gather a force of 700 men. 

C.3.c. 2 December 

Thinking that Fort Bonifacio was still under rebel Ranger control, 
Cabanlig said that he decided to launch an attack against the FSRR HQ. 
As they were ready to move, he received a telephone call from the Army 
Chief of Staff, BGen Saavedra, advising the former to stop from attacking 
as Fort Bonifacio had already been cleared. Cabanligreceived a call from 
de Villa who ordered him to prepare the Battalion he had formed to 
reinforce the troops in Malacafiang on de Villa's orders. 349 

C3.d. 3 December 

On this day, the PMAR continued to consolidate forces; it remained 
at standby to reinforce Malacafiang forces. 360 

C.3.e. 4 December 

At about noon, BGen Aguirre called BGen Cabanlig to request the 
latter to move his battalion to Paseo de Roxas in Makati. When Cabanlig 
cleared this with de Villa, the latter granted him authority to move; he

C.4.a. 30 November 

Declaration of Red Alert 

Because of the intelligence reports on the Tagaytay City relay 
station attack at 10:30 p.m. the previous day, CG PAF MGen Jose de 
Leon, declared a red alert in all PAF units. 353 BGen Rogelio Estacio, CG 
PAFSECOM placed the 805th Special Operations Squadron (SOS) on 
standby alert by 10:40 a.m. of 30 November. 354 At 2:00 p.m., BGen Loven 
Abadia, the Commander of the 205th Helicopter Wing (205 HW), put his 
unit on red alert. 355 By evening, Estacio received intelligence reports 
that the coup would be staged at dawn of 1 December. He requested one 
V-150 from the PAF Operations Officer to help in securing NAIAbut this 
was denied. 356 Col Felipe Abando, Jr, Commander of the 100th Training 
Wing, Fernando Air Base, Lipa City, received similar intelligence 
information, and ordered that base security be increased. 367 

Immediately after the adjournment of the Command Conference 
called by CSAFP in Camp Aguinaldo, MGen de Leon called up his office 
to inform his officers to be ready for a conference. Upon his arrival, de 
Leon convened the conference with the various COs of the PAF, the Unit 
Commanders in VAB, and the HQ staff at the Hall of Flags on the third 
floor of the PAF headquarters (HPAF). 358

The conference started by about midnight. 359 As de Leon broke the 
news to his officers, saying: "Gentlemen, there is this fantastic news 
about . . r he was cut short by gunfire from the direction of Gate 2 of 



CHAPTER V 291 



VAB. 360 Immediately after, two LVTs with two V-150 Commandos, two 
6x6 trucks and other armored vehicles led the troops of the MBLT 4 
under de la Pefia, along with the Marines under Gojo towards VAB. The 
vehicles rammed Gate 3 of Fort Bonifacio and followed by about 200 
troops following, crossed the bridge across South Expressway and moved 
towards Gate 2 of VAB. 361 An LVT rammed through Gate 2 of VAB. 362 
They rumbled along Sales Street in VAB. Immediately, the VAB Unit 
Commanders rushed back to their units while de Leon, Vice Commander 
BGen Protacio, BGen Leopoldo Acot and the HPAF Staff rushed to the 
adjacent Command Operations Center (COC) which was also on the 
third floor. The entries to the third floor were sealed with iron grills and 
barricaded by office tables. 363 BGen Loven Abadia rushed to the 205 HW 
HQ. 364 BGen Estacio rushed out of the conference rooms, stopped by his 
quarters for his arms and slipped through the golf course into NALA 365 

The Marines were composed mainly of MBLT 4 from Fort Bonifacio 
led by Maj de la Pena and Capt Calimag, and other units like the 4th MC 
under Lt Filomeno Macahilig, 2Lt Jarius Gelverson III and 2Lt Oscar 
Ramos, the 24th MC under 2Lts Delfin Actas and Memel Roxas; and the 
44th MC under Lt Santos Petalio, 2Lt Adonis Fernandez and 2Lt Oscar 
dela Pena. Elements of the 31st MC, MBLT 1 stationed in Sta. Catalina, 
Bata, Bulacan and led by 2Lt Francis Carandang and 2Lt Gerry Tagle 
later joined in attacking VAB. 

Within an hour, the Marines gained control of VAB. 

Takeover of 520 ABW 

The first move of the rebels was to capture the armor assets inside 
VAB assigned to the 529th Special Operations Squadron (529 SOS) 
which is under the 520th Air Base Wing (520 ABW). The SOS was 
organized by then CG PAF MGen Sotelo after the August 1987 coup as 
an anti-coup force. It was provided with two V-150s, four recoilless 
rifles, ten machine guns, and other armaments. Yet, when the time came 
for the squadron to defend VAB, not a shot was fired. In fact, its two V- 
150s were used by the rebels to attack Camp Aguinaldo on 3 December. 366 

Capt Robert Yusay, EX-0 of the 529 SOS, while proceeding to his 
HQ, met the Marines following the LVTs. 367 Yusay immediately radioed 
the Wing Commander (WC) of the 520 ABW, who advised him to check 
out the movement. Yusay then proceeded to the 520 ABW barracks, 
woke up TSgt Armando Padilla and his men, and ordered them to take 
out the two V-150s with body number F-301 and F-302. 368 The men 
boarded their tanks. Yusay then radioed the WC to report that his unit, 



292 



including the two V-150s, was ready for action upon orders. The advise 
was to maintain the stronghold. 369 Likewise, 2Lt Abner Awang, Light 
Armor Commander PAF, sought clearance from his superiors to engage 
the rebels but was told not to confront them. 

In the meantime, 70 to 80 armed soldiers led by Lt Hernando "Boy* 
Caraig of 16 IB, PA, based in Quezon, surrounded the tanks while the 
personnel of the 529 SOS readied themselves inside the tank. Noting the 
superior number of Caraig's men, the tank commander, Lt Domingo 
Balitaan, directed the crew to disembark but to lock the tank's door. 
TSgt Padilla was brought to Lt Caraig and was asked where the crew 
were. Padilla refused to answer. This prompted Caraig to threaten 
Padilla with bodily harm. Later, Caraig* s men destroyed the door locks 
of the tank and Padilla was ordered to drive and tow the van used by the 
Marines. The van was stuck after overshooting the corners of Zetzer and 
Andrews Avenues. After doing so, Padilla requested Caraig to allow him 
to disengage. This time, the latter allegedly threatened Padilla with 
death if he did. 370 The rebels took complete control of the 529 SOS, and 
later, left at 1:30 a.m. of 1 December, making sure all the communication 
lines were out. 371 Meanwhile, they had stored the firearms they gathered 
from the 529 SOS personnel in the two V-150s they had commandeered. 372 

Attack on the 205th Helicopter Wing HQ 

Other Marine troopers maneuvered to capture the air assets inside 
the base. After ramming Gate 2, the Marine LVTs went to the flight line 
of the 205 HW. Fifty Marines marching at the back of the LVTs 
disarmed the guards at the 505 Air Reserve (AR) flight line, and took 
hostage four officers and 26 enlisted personnel (EP). Capt Antonio 
Bautista, Commander of the 209th Tactical Helicopter Squadron, who 
was still at the flight line, directed two EPs to arm their helicopters. 
They immediately returned because rebel Marines had already taken 
control of the flight line. 373 

By early morning, several trucks with an estimated two companies 
had entered the flight line to reinforce the rebel troops. Two platoons 
with the LVTs proceeded to Hangars B and C and immobilized the 452nd 
First Division Marine Squadron (FDMS) arid 451st Special Squadron 
(SS) personnel. 374 Then two V- 150s followed and stopped at the 205 HW 
driveway near the Bachelor Officers Quarters (BOQ). The Marines in 
the V-150s shouted at the Wing personnel led by BGen Loven Abadia to 
surrender but the latter steadfastly held their ground and placed more 
M-60 machine guns in front of the HQ 375 



By dawn, the rebel Marine tanks bombarded the 205 HW HQ area 
with cannon fire. 376 A gunbattle ensued as Loven Abadia and his men 
gave resistance to the Marines 1 attack. 377 The fjrefight lasted ten to 15 
minutes. 378 Loven Abadia and his men laid flat on their stomachs as the 
tanks kept firing. Rebel Rangers were seen leading the attack. When 
one of Loven Abadia's men was injured, a PAF colonel on the government 
side waved his cap at the LVTs so that he could approach the wounded 
soldier. The colonel was mad and he shouted invectives at the Rangers 
who also approached the wounded man. The Colonel shouted: "Bakit 
ninyo kami binabaril? Hindi ba kami ang sumasagip sa inyo sa bundok? 
[Why are you firing at us? Aren't we the ones who save you in the 
mountains?]" 379 

The gunbattle left the 205 HW HQ partially burned and the BOQ 
razed to the ground. The force of the Marines was overwhelming. They 
later took control of the 205 HW tarmac. They, however, were not able 
to fly any of the helicopters and other aircraft because none of the pilots 
of the 205 HW HQ would cooperate with the rebels. 380 

Rebel Control of the Gates 

Other rebel Marines in Villamor supported by armor took control of 
Gates 1, 2 and 3. Not knowing about the loyalty of the Marines as they 
passed the 528th Law Enforcement Squadron (LES) HQ, its EX-O, Capt 
Jose Maceda, led a team to investigate Gate 2 where Marines surrounded 
them and confiscated their firearms. Maceda identified the rebel officers 
as Lt Col Gojo, Lt Col Gasmin, Capt Mariano, ex-Lt Col Bernarte, Capt 
Querubin, Capt Pineda, and another captain with Serial No: 0-7790 38 
who confiscated Capt Maceda's .45 cal pistol. 382 

Entry at HPAF 

The Headquarters of the Philippine Air Force (HPAF) houses the 
offices of top PAF officers including the COC which coordinates all 
movements of the PAF. At 4:00 a.m., rebel Marines surrounded HPAF 
and broke the glass doors of the first and second floors. They checked out 
every office including those belonging to Air Personnel, Logistics, 
Comptroller, Dental Surgeon, Chief of Engineers, and the Chief Chaplain 
The personnel in the Dental Surgeon's office were sent to . th e Dental 
Dispensary and the Chaplain personnel to the chapel, while the Air 
Logistics personnel were told to stay in the office but were ordered to 
keep the doors locked. All telephone lines in the HPAF were cut. The 
Marines ransacked the HPAF Supply Section as the seven supply 
personnel were disarmed and confined at the office ofthe Air Comptroller. 



294 



Negotiation at the HPAF 

Inside the Air Personnel Office, Col Santiago Madrid, PAF EX-O, 
met the rebel Marines. He asked that he be brought to M^j De la Pefta 
whom he personally knew. Madrid was led to de la Pefla and Lt Col Gojo 
at the hallway of HPAF. Gojo wanted to assault the third floor of the 
HPAF and gave an ultimatum. Madrid, in an effort to negotiate with the 
rebels, called the COC at the third floor and was able to relay the 
ultimatum. Answering the call, the Air Personnel Officer replied that 
Gojo must deal first with the Commander of the Air Squadron, BGen 
Acot, before making any move towards the third floor. 

Dialogues followed. Col Roberto Sabularse, Air Comptroller EX-O, 
and Madrid served as intermediaries who relayed messages between the 
rebels and the PAF officers at the third floor. They managed to convince 
the former not to attack the third floor because all the personnel there 
were already immobilized. Madrid also tried to convince Gojo to stop the 
attack at the 205 HW. 

MGen de Leon, in the meantime, was able to maintain constant 
communication with other unit commanders and to direct the operation 
of other PAF bases through the COC. Fortunately, the personnel of the 
Office of th e Director for Communications-Electronics under Col Edgardo 
Rosal, who were on stand by at the third floor, ensured the continuous 
operation of the radio and telephone in the COC. 384 

By 4:00 a.m. some tanks and Marine troops, after immobilizing the 
205 HW, the BOQ and Hangars B and C, the 505 ARS, 520 ABW and the 
452 FDMS, had regrouped at the flight line. Two more Marine platoons 
crossed Fort Bonifacio to VAB. Armed with bazookas and machine guns, 
the rebels occupied the overpass connecting the gates of both camps. 386 

Meanwhile, Lt Caraig, after immobilizing the 520 ABW, ordered the 
two V-150s to be brought to the gate of the 420 SW HQ. The armor 
vehicles, upon orders of Caraig, rammed the gate but were fired upon. 386 

As of 8:00 a.m. the Marine troops were still in control of VAB. They 
were then consolidating their forces, with some Marine elements looting 
the firearms supply and cash storage boxes. 387 At 9:00 a.m., some 
Marines started to move out. Members of the MBLT 4 boarded a 6 x 6 
truck which brought them to PTV-4. 



CHAPTER V 295 



Aircraft Activity from Villamor 

The NCRDC Command Operations Center received a report that a 
helicopter left VAB for Camps Aguinaldo and Crame at about 5:15 
a.m. 388 Upon learning this, personnel at the HPAF contacted BGen Jope 
Comendador, CG 2 Air Division (2 AD), to request for the dispatch of four 
F-5s from Mactan Air Base (MAB) in order to intercept the rebel planes 
at VAB. The planes from MAB never arrived. It was later learned that 
Comendador prevented the pilots from flying the planes. 389 

The Marines wanted to take control of the helicopter air assets 
in VAB. Ex-Lt Cols Ceferino Sarmenta and Dante Bernarte tried to 
persuade, but without success, the pilots of 505 ARS under Lt Col Rodolfo 
de Castro, Squadron Commander, to fly the helicopters out of VAB. 390 
Bernarte was also seen talking to Lt Lopito Gonzales, aide of Col Jaime 
Ileto, at the back of the VAB theatre. Incidentally, both Bernarte and 
Gonzales were also implicated in the August 1987 coup. 391 

According to Gonzales, however, he was sent by Ileto from Clark Air 
Base to return Loven Abadia's gun. He was still in VAB when the 
attempted coup occurred, and he talked to Bernarte who was his 
previous CO. 392 

Fireftght at the 205HWHQ 

The firefight at the 205 HW still raged by early afternoon. The Wing 
personnel fired at the LVTs and the Marine troops as they approached 
the HQ area. 393 The Marines retaliated with a Howitzer round aimed at 
the HQ, which damaged the Wing Adjutant's office, killed TSgt Austria 
and wounded Sgt Rolando Acevedo, A1C Alex Urnaguing, and Sgt 
Baccay. 39 * Personnel of the 529 SOS, 520 ABW with their Squadron 
Commander, Maj Julius de la Torre, proceeded to the 205 HW HQ after 
a ten-minute lull in firing. While at the corridor of the building with some 
personnel of the 205 HW, de la Torre heard two big bursts from an M203 
(grenade launcher) fired by the Marines. These hit the 529 SOS building 
and wounded its seven personnel. 

During the lull, women were seen bringing food to the rebels. Loven 
Abadia tried to contact GHQ AFP to bring reinforcements. However, it 
was reported that the tank reinforcement sent turned around and joined 
the rebels. 396 



296 



Negotiation for a Ceasefire 

Col Felix Duenas, Air Plans EX-O, called up Col Paulino Poquez, 
Duty Officer of the 205 HW, to advise the Wing personnel not to return 
fire as the former was negotiating a ceasefire with the rebel Marines at 
HPAF. Col Romeo Daranchang, together with Lt Col Cordero and Capt 
Andayan, arrived at HPAF to persuade Gojo and de la Pefia to return to 
Fort Bonifacio. Both rebel officers refused. 

Duenas and Sabularse spoke to Loven Abadia proposing a ceasefire 
wherein Abadia was not to take counter-offensive action provided the' 
Marines desist from attacking Abadia and his men. This proposal was 
similar to an earlier agreement forged with the rebels at HPAF. Loven 
Abadia refused, insisting that the Marines should leave the 205 HW area 
first. But as the Marine troopers continued firing, he fought back. 
Meanwhile, rebel Marines and Rangers surrounded the 205 HW 
compound and some were able to penetrate the rear, capturing some of 
Loven Abadia's men. Abadia moved forward and went inside a building 
near the 205 HW HQ. 

Cols Sabularse, Duenas, and Atayde, Deputy Commander of the 205 
HW, met with Lt Gener del Rosario of 16 IB, 2 ID, who referred them 
to ex-Lt Col Bernarte, who in turn, directed them to Col Reynaldo 
Samaco. Unable to decide on Abadia's terms, Samaco escorted them to 
Gojo who was at the HPAF area. While initially insistent that Abadia 
and his men first lay down their arms, Gojo finally agreed not to fire as 
long as Abadia and his men would not fire. Col Sabularse and company 
returned to the 205 HW area but found the 205 HW personnel already 
disarmed; Abadia, however, was nowhere to be found. He was still inside 
a building together with four unidentified lieutenants. 396 

Atayde stayed behind while Sabularse and Duenas proceeded to the 
Air Force Research and Development Center. The two were tasked to see 
Gojo at the HPAF area to arrange a meeting with either BGens Acot or 
Protacio. 397 Acot was able to talk to Gojo. 398 The rebel Marines at the 
205 HW area were then fetched by trucks, later consolidating at the 
HPAF , 399 Loven Abadia managed to escape, and boarded a taxi for Camp 
Aguinaldo. 

Then at about 3:00 p.m., news of a government offensive was 
received. Poquez received a call from Capt Edgardo Samonte, CSAFP 
Aide, that loyal F-5s strafed and destroyed the rebel air assets in 
Sangley. Unconfirmed news that the F-5s will also go to VAB to target 
the tanks at the 205 HW flight line made Poquez instruct his personnel 



CHAPTER V 297 



to retreat behind the HQ. The F-5s did not arrive. Instead, three USAF 
F-4s flew over VAB on persuasion flights. 400 

President Aquino made a call at 3:34 p.m. to Capt Eustaquito 
Manalo, Wing Commander, 205th Presidential Airlift Wing. Manalo 
briefed the President about the situation in his area. 401 

Movement of Rebel Marines to Camp Aguinaldo 

The Marines disabled the helicopters located at the VAB tarmac and 
those inside Hangars B and C by breaking their chin bubbles and cutting 
the electrical wirings. 402 After doing so, the Marines left the hangars and 
started converging near the HPAF. 

At about 10:00 p.m., a large number of Marines prepared to leave the 
HPAF. Three LVTs, three V-150s, two of them with serial nos F-301 and 
F-302, and several trucks, joined the Marines. 403 2Lt Gelvezon ordered 
his troops to move. 404 The 4 MC MBLT 4 left Villamor and headed 
north. 406 Some of his men thought they were returning to Fort Bonifacio; 
but instead, they headed for EDSA on foot. There was some shooting as 
they crossed the Magallanes overpass, but they were able to continue 
towards White Plains. 406 The rebel Marine troops passed through 
Mandaluyong, then Valle Verde and ended up near the Mormon Church 
at White Plains. 407 Although some of the Marines returned to barracks 
during this night march, the rebels numbered about 600 by the time 
they were in the vicinity of Camp Aguinaldo. 403 

BGen Gerardo Flores, PC-INP Intelligence Chief (C2), received a 
report on the departure of the rebel Marines from VAB. The 701 Bde 
under Col Edgardo Batenga was dispatched from Camp Aguinaldo to 
block the rebel Marines at the corner of EDS A and Ortigas Avenue. 409 At 
around 1:00 p.m., the Marines (with some PA and GHQ troops) under 
Lt del Rosario were fired upon by a government Sikorsky helicopter as 
they were headed towards White Plains, causing them to retreat to an 
abandoned house. 410 

C.4.c. 2 December 

Government Forces Retake Control of VAB and Assess Damage 

By midnight, rebel Marines had completely withdrawn from VAB, 
and government troops once again took control of the base. 411 Capt Lauro 
de la Cruz, Security Officer, went down from the third floor and assessed 
the damage at the HPAF. 412 2Lt Abner Awang with 14 men, took over 



the 529 SOS building. The commander of 529 SOS also found that their 
armory had been ransacked, and the cabinets plus table drawers were 
forcibly opened. An inventory was made of the supply and the armory. 
The 529 SOS personnel were then directed to secure Gate 2. The DACE 
and 501 CS personnel worked round the clock and reinstalled 28 APP 
and PLDT telephones that were disconnected in the HPAF offices, 
including the PLDT cable destroyed during the firefight at the 205 
HW. 413 

As a precautionary measure against a possible return of the rebels, 
the Explosives Detection and Demolition Team (EDDT), was directed to 
plant claymore mines and improvised bombs (drums of gasoline) at 
Gates 1 and 2 of VAB to prevent possible re-entry of rebel tanks. The 
EDDT also scoured the area for bombs that may have been planted by 
rebel forces. In the process, they discovered three boxes of ammunition 
taken from the 205 HW HQ and the Presidential Airlift Wing and 
a PLDT transmission line in a plastic container at the 520 ABW 
Commander's Office. 414 

C.4.d. 3 December 

The AFP TRACOM convoy under BGen Pedro Juachon, which 
included two V-150s and a crew from NCRDC, arrived at VAB at early 
dawn with instructions from MGen de Leon to stay in VAB, defend the 
base from possible enemy attacks, and apprehend withdrawing rebel 
forces holed up in Makati or Manila intending to regroup at VAB. 415 

C.5. Manila Domestic Airport and 
Cavite Coastal Road Incident 

To the rebels, control of airports is necessary to stop the movement 
of government troops from other areas and to facilitate the arrival of 
rebel troops and armaments from the provinces. 

C.5*a. Before 30 November 

Planning for the Takeover of Manila Domestic Airport 

As early as 15 and 16 November 1989, a group composed of ex-Mfl 
Lyle Tugbang and Maj Jose Gamos, TSgt Inocentes Dionesa and some 
members of the NAIA Police led by P/Lt Romeo Raquion held a conference 
at the office of Viking Brokerage located at the old Manila International 
Airport (MIA) in preparation for the launching of a coup d'etat. During 
the meeting, Raquion assured Gamos that he could supply 15 of his men, 



CHAPTER V 299 



mostly members of the Guardians. 416 It seemed that the purpose of the 
meeting was to recruit volunteers to augment rebel forces in their 
takeover of NAIA and the Manila Domestic Airport (MDA). Raquion, 
however, denied any participation in the coup. 417 

C.5.b. 30 November 

Mobilization of the Guardians 

In the early evening, Rodolfo Morit, Jr, a ranking national officer and 
Honasan's co-in corporator of the Guardian Centre Foundation Inc 
(GCFI), went inside the prison reservation of the Bureau of Corrections 
in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila and gathered about 30 Guardians 418 
Morit was dressed in a military uniform. He directed them to attend a 
meeting of the Guardians at Baltao Subdivision in Paranaque, Metro 
Manila that same evening. 

The 30 Guardians were composed of 26 prison guards, including 
Manuel Garces, Jr, the founder and leader of the Bureau of Corrections 
Muntinlupa Guardian Brotherhood Inc Chapter, and four civilians 
identified as Baggy Sacco, Rolando Pascual, Eduardo Franco and Roger 
Borja. 419 

The group left Muntinlupa at about 10:00 p.m in three civilian 
vehicles (two Harabas and a jeepney) driven by one Brasil, Garces and 
Sacco. On their way to Baltao Subdivision, Morit told them that their 
mission was to assist the government forces at the NAIA against the 
expected attack of NPA rebel forces. 420 They arrived at Baltao Subdivision 
at around 11:00 p.m. 

The movement of the prison guards was reported by Bureau of 
CorrectionsSuperintendent Vicente Apurongto Prisons Director Meliton 
Goyena, a retired PC brigadier general. Goyena was told that the reason 
for the movement was to assist the RAM-HF soldiers stage a coup in 
Manila. 421 

Troop Movement of Maj Jose Gamos and ex-MajLyle Tugbang 

At about 11:00 p.m., some 70 uniformed armed men led by M^j 
Gamos and ex-Maj Tugbang, met at the Barangay Hall of Brgy Vi tales, 
Paranaque. 422 



300 



C.5x. 1 December 

This group of 70 armed men proceeded to MDA. 

At about 1:35 a.m., the government monitoring team at VAB reported 
heavy exchange of gunfire at the vicinity of MDA. 423 The PAFSECOM 
soldiers, defending the airport terminal, fought the RAM-HF forces. At 
around 2:00 a.m., another heavy exchange of gunfire in front of the area 
took place lasting for ten minutes. 424 

Danilo "King* Cruz, a broker representative, received a radio call 
from ex-U Col Bibit to proceed to Baltao Subdivision fronting the Cargo 
Terminal at NALA Cruz was PRO of the Customs Gun Club when Bibit 
was the president. Cruz is said to be an ex-PC Sergeant and former 
bodyguard of Jackie Ponce Enrile. At the NAIA, Cruz saw Bibit and 40 
other armed men, one of whom was Tugbang. From NAIA, the group 
proceeded to MDA 425 

Gamos arrived at Baltao Subdivision with his armed companions 
and led them and the Guardians from the Bureau of Corrections to the 
Ding Velayo Sports Complex across MDA, arriving there at 5:00 a.m. 
Gamos instructed the Guardians to stay there and await the delivery of 
food. 426 The group of Gamos positioned themselves at the Customs 
Intelligence and Investigation Service office at the old MIA. 

About 100 RAM-HF soldiers arrived at the Baggage Terminal Area 
of MDA and demanded from Lina Precalla, a lady security guard, the 
keys to the parked vehicles outside. Since Precalla did not have the keys, 
Capt Bistro, the leader of the rebels, ordered the rigging of the ignition 
system so the vehicles could be used. 427 

By 5:45 a.m., the forces of Gamos and Tugbang, now numbering 
about 100, had taken control of the MDA Terminal Building. They 
overpowered the PAFSECOM personnel guarding the building and 
herded them into a room inside the terminal. 428 

By morning the RAM-HF forces began using PAL facilities at MDA 
At about 9:00 a.m., a van resembling a PAL delivery truck arrived at the 
Velayo Sports Complex bringing food in packs similar to that served 
during in-flight meals. The Guardians partook of the food and sharedit 
with their fellow rebels inside the sports complex. 429 

At 10:00 a.m., a V-150 with "RAM-SFP" markings 430 earlier captured 
at VAB bythe rebel forces ledbyLt Caraig, arrived at the MDA. 431 Then, 



CHAPTER V 301 



three PAL vehicles arrived infront of the PC/INP Hangar loaded with 
about 20 fully-armed men, either in military or civilian attire. One 
alighted and talked to P/Lt Ricardo Espiritu, a police officer stationed 
at the hangar. To avoid armed confrontation and destruction of PC/INP 
assets, an agreement was reached allowing P/Lt Espiritu and his men 
to retain their arms and equipment, while the rebel soldiers in the PAL 
vehicles stayed in the area. 432 

The V-150 returned to VAB by early evening and then proceeded 
to the South Expressway to wait for other rebel troops coming from 
Calamba, Laguna. 433 It was reported that these troops stopped upon 
reaching the Calamba gate of the South Expressway, when a govern- 
ment helicopter flown by BGen Loven Abadia hovered over and poised 
to attack them if they proceeded. 434 

Government Troops Take Defensive Action 

At the Quick Reaction Center at the old MIA, a Battle Staff was 
created by the PAFSECOM. There were reports that Bibit used the 
telephone facilities of DHL office located at the old MIA building. 435 A 
detailed check of DHL phone bills did not disclose any use by Bibit of 
DHL phones. However, DHL Philippines General Manager Jose Feliciano 
told the Commission that Crism el Verano has been DHL's tax consultant 
for more than ten years now. 436 Verano is linked to the coup in the Galido 
affidavits. 437 In coordination with NAIA General Manager Eduardo 
Carrascoso, PAFSECOM personnel barricaded runways 06-24 and 13- 
31 with fire trucks, baggage containers and other obstruction to prevent 
the use of the runways by the rebels. 438 

Withdrawal from the Manila Domestic Airport and 
Confrontation at the Cavite Coastal Road 

By afternoon, the RAM-HF forces led by Gamos and Tugbang, 
withdrew from MDA and proceeded to the vicinity of Quirino Avenue 
and Coastal Road in Paranaque. They were blocked by government 
forces from the South Sector Command (SSC) of PC CAPCOM led by its 
CO, Lt Col Jose Bandung, Jr. The roadblock was earlier established at 
2:00 a.m. by BGen Aguirre to prevent the entry of rebel fuces from 
Cavite. 439 

The RAM-HF troops sent an emissary in the person ofTSgt Inocen tes 
Dionesa, PC, to request Bandung not to block their way. Because 
Bandung would not give way, a firefight lasting for about two hours 
occurred. 440 After a while, Gamos again sent a feeler to Bandung and 



302 



when that effort failed, shooting erupted between the contending forces 
until the rebels started to withdraw towards Tambo, Parafiaque. 441 

At about 5:00 p.m., the troops of P/Lt Col Romeo Maganto, CO 
MPFF, in two 6 x 6 trucks, arrived at the Coastal Road area to augment 
the blocking force of Bandung and to establish another road block 
there. 442 

During the firefight, Bandung, PC SSgts Leonardo de la Rosa, 
Melvynne Luzuriaga, Reynaldo Montforte, and Chito Mercado, all of 
the government side, were wounded. 443 On the rebel side, Cpl Uywas 
killed and others were wounded including Danilo Cruz. A Red Cross 
volunteer was similarly wounded and Airport policeman Ruben de la 
Cruz was killed. 444 

Withdrawal of the Guardians 

The Guardians from Muntinlupa stayed in front of the Ding Velayo 
Sports Complex up to 3:00 p.m., waitingfor the promised delivery of guns 
and uniforms. No delivery was made. When the RAM-HF soldiers 
occupying MDA left, the Guardians felt abandoned. 446 They started 
leaving the place one by one; the last one to leave was Manuel Garces, 
Jr. According to the latter, they abandoned their three vehicles prior 
to their return to Muntinlupa to avoid detection. 448 They were able to 
return to the New Bilibid Prison Reservation in Muntinlupa that same 
afternoon, unnoticed by the guards at the main gate, despite the 
augmented guards and the two machine guns earlier mounted at the 
main entrance of the prison reservation. 447 

No formal administrative investigation was conducted by the Bureau 
of Correction officials and no formal report had been submitted to the 
Department of Justice about the activities of these guards during the 
last coup. The Commission, through Resolution No.089 449 dated 4 July 
1990, recommended to the Department of Justice their investigation. 

RAM-HF Soldiers Withdraw 

By 9:30 p m., majority of the RAM-HF soldiers inside MDA had 
pulled out and moved towards VAB on board private cars and vans. 489 
Moments after the armed group that arrived at the PC/INP Hangar 
premises also left the area. 451 



CHAPTER V 303 



C.6. PTV-4 Incident 
C.6.a. SO November 

The takeover of the government television station, PTV-4, located 
at Bohol Avenue, Quezon City, was crucial for the coup considering that 
television is a vital medium for propaganda. When informed about an 
impending coup, Conrado Limcaoco, network manager of PTV-4, 
instructed his security aide, MSgt Jesus de Guzman, to advise 2Lt 
Alfredo Javillonar, PC OIC Security Platoon assigned at PTV-4, that a 
red alert had been declared at about 5:00 p.m. Javillonar was then at 
hiscampatBagoBantay. 452 Later that night, Javillonar went to PTV- 
4 and briefed his personnel, assigning some of them to the entrance gate 
at Scout Albano St and the others to the barracks inside the compound. 453 

Movement of Rebels to PTV-4 Complex 

At about midnight, the 34 MC of the MBLT 4 under Lt Rolando Cal, 
arrived at the PTV-4 compound from VAB aboard two ten-wheeler 
civilian trucks, taxis, and Ford Fieras, accompanied by two V-150s. 
According to Pfc Cadera, 454 the movement was upon orders of Gojo. 
Other units were also mobilized by the RAM-HF troops. 

C.6.b. 1 December 

At around 1:40 a.m., Capt Nestor Bernardino, CO 221 PC Coy 
stationed in Taytay, Rizal, told his men of the directive for them to 
establish checkpoints in Taytay. However, instead of doing so, he 
brought his men to PTV-4 compound where they were met by several 
soldiers upon their arrival at around 2:00 a.m. Three unidentified 
officers fetched Capt Bernardino. When he returned, he distributed 
white patches to his men for countersign purposes. Some soldiers 
withdrew from the area and returned to their station 456 because they 
sensed that Capt Bernardino deceived them. 

By 1:00 a.m. an undetermined number of RAM-HF soldiers stopped 
a ten-wheeler truck (Plate No CFL 333) at the Nichols underpass. The 
truck driver, Anastacio de la Cruz, said thathe was delivering construction 
materials to Pasay City when he was commandeered by men in military 
uniform. 456 The truck was brought to PTV-4 at about 3:00 a.m. where the 
soldiers disembarked. 457 



Attack at PTV-4 Complex 

At 1: 10 a.m., some 250 Scout Rangers and Marines clad in black and 
comouflage uniforms, respectively, with one Scorpion tank and a V- 150 
arrived and deployed at Scout Esguerra and Albano Streets near PTV- 
4. 468 Lt Col Ernesto Salvador, CO of the NCRDC Security Battalion, 
called 2Lt Javillonar and instructed him to prepare as rebel soldiers 
were likely to enter the area. 469 By 1:30 a.m., two ten-wheeler trucks 
loaded with uniformed men followed by two V-150s and one APC tank 
approached the PTV-4 gate. The two trucks stopped at the pedestrian 
gate and the men under Lt Cal rushed inside the compound and occupied 
strategic points. The V-150s and the APC proceeded to Scout Albano St 
J avillonar ordered the duty technicians to immobilize the television and 
radio stations. 460 Cal asked Javillonar to join them but he refused. 4 * 

A reinforcement platoon from Alpha Coy, Security Battalion, under 
Lt Manuel Visperas and 2Lt Oscar Fajardo, was dispatched to PTV-4 to 
aid Javillonar and his unit. 462 The platoon, aboard a 6x6 truck, arrived 
at PTV-4 at 1:40 a.m. 463 Fajardo, was instructed by Lt Col Salvador 
through the radio to assault the rebel forces. Fajardo hesitated because 
the rebel forces were superior in number. Moreover, government troops 
and civilian employees of PTV-4 were still inside. Instead, Visperas 
tried to negotiate for the peaceful and safe evacuation of Javillonar and 
his men. 464 Javillonar introduced Cal to Visperas. Cal gave Visperas 
the choice of either joining them or remaining neutral. Salvador arrived 
to personally assess the situation. He negotiated with an unidentified 
soldier who told him that the rebels were ted by Kapunan and Batac. 
After negotiations, civilian employees and government troops were 
allowed to leave the PTV-4 compound. 

Javillonar then proceeded to their barracks situated at PTV-4's 
tennis court which was also surrounded by rebel forces. One of his men 
reported that the armory of the Security Platoon was opened and 
unidentified Scout Rangers took, among others, three M-16 rifles, one 
.50 cal mach.:-e gun, and a recoilless rifle. It was reported that "RAM 
boys" entered the barracks and held at gunpoint SN1 Ricardo Peiia, Sgt 
Tambot PAF, JNl Galit, Cpl Bataan, AlC Canlas, and SSgt Baybayan. 
Personal belongings such as fatigue uniforms and shoes were also taken. 
He then directed his men to join Visperas' men at the gate of PTV-4. 466 

Salvador ordered Javillonar to move to GMA-7 and Visperas to 
proceed to Broadcast City. 466 At the main gate, Salvador ordered his 
men to move out since they were outnumbered. 467 



CHAPTER V 305 



Government Troops Regroup 

Salvador's men regrouped at GMA-7 at about 3:30 a.m. and from 
there proceeded to Broadcast City where they linked up with the unit of 
Maj Marcelino Yacat, PMAR, head of the military detachment at the 
Batasang Pambansa. BGen Biazon gave orders for Salvador to act as 
negotiator with the rebels at PTV-4, and for Yacat to lead the combined 
units of the Security Battalion and the Marine forces to launch a tactical 
assault against the rebels should the negotiations fail. 468 

At 4:00 a.m., some Officer Candidate School (OCS) students of AFP 
TRACOM led by Maj Wilhelm Doromal arrived at PTV-4 to support the 
rebel forces. 469 Meanwhile, armed men with white armbands entered 
the PTV-4 penthouse. A certain Mr Bilbao recognized "Red" Kapunan 
among them. 470 

By 5:00 a.m. , the streets leading to PTV-4 were blocked by the rebels 
with the assistance of some civilians. Rebel troops blocked the corner 
of Quezon Blvd and EDSA with a ten-wheeler truck. 471 NCRDC COC 
received a report that rebel Scout Rangers and Marines were also 
blocking the vicinity of Bohol Avenue and Scout Albano St. 472 Cal pulled 
out the 34 MC from PTV-4 and stationed it at a nearby street corner. 473 
Some rebels went to Quezon Blvd staying there till nightfall of 1 
December. 474 

Government Troops Try to Retake PTV-4 

At5:00a.m., the four platoons ofthe Marine Security Group (MSG), 
with orders from higher HQ arrived at PTV-4 to retake it At the back 
of PTV-4, RAM-HF soldiers started firing at the first MSG platoon. An 
exchange of gunfire ensued. A grenade from an M-79 grenade launcher 
exploded, injuring Pfc Binanitan and Pfc Tironez. 475 

The other government troops moved to the intersection of Quezon 
Blvd and EDSA The fourth MSG platoon under Capt Javier and the 22 
MC MBLT 2 under 2Lt Ramon Mitra III moved towards south of Quezon 
Blvd while the other platoons turned lea towards Cubao. At the vicinity 
of Aristocrat Restaurant, about 200 enemy troops were positioned. As 
Capt Javier's troops were taking cover , heavy fire came from a Tora-Tora 
Plane killing Pfc Villaces and Cpl Galpo and wounding Sgt Lasang, Sgt 
Rafallo, Cpl Rudam, Pfc Rivero, TSgt Catbugan, SSgt Hernandez, Pfc 
Caasi, and Sgt Vitales. 476 



The government troopers returned fire, retaliating with their V- 150. 
The first, second and third platoons under Capt Bucsit stationed 
themselves at the corner wall of PTV-4 in Mother Ignacia and Scout 
Albano intersection. Another firefight started at about 5:30 am. During 
a lull in the righting, Maj Yacat took the opportunity to negotiate for the 
surrender of the rebels. 

Meanwhile, the fourth platoon was deployed by Capt Javier within 
50 meters from PTV-4. They planned to redeploy by squads. When they 
were about to do so, they were hit by gunfire from 90 RR mortar and 
bombing from a Tora-Tora plane. 477 

The elements of the MSG and the Marine Contingency Battalion 
failed at this time to retake PTV-4 due to strong enemy resistance and 
the presence of civilians. They instead established* blocking positions 
at the intersection of EDSA and Quezon Blvd. 478 At 6:45 a.m., armed 
confrontation continued. While the 22 MC MBLT 2 soldiers were 
resting at a corner not far from PTV-4, enemy soldiers fired at them. 
They fired back causing the rebels to retreat. 479 

Enemy Airstrikes and Reinforcements 

At 7:00 a.m., the 15 SW Operation Center monitored that PTV-4 was 
a target of the rebel Tora-Tora planes. 480 Upon sighting the convoy of 
government troops heading for PTV-4, two Tora-Toras strafed them, 
killinga number of civilians and soldiers at EDSA and Quezon Blvd. The 
rebel planes were also observed flying over Camp Aguinaldo and bombing 
NCRDC Headquarters by 7:20 a-m. 481 

At 8:00 a.m., a rebel Sikorsky helicopter joined the two Tora-Toras 
in strafing government forces under Salvador and Yacat. 482 The helicopter 
also bombed NCRDC Headquarters. 483 It attacked elements of the 
Security Battalion positioned at the transmitter of RPN 9 in Panay 
Avenue. 484 

At 9:00a.m., the44 MCMBLT41eftVABonboarda6x6truck,and 
proceeded to PTV-4 to reinforce the 34 MC MBLT 4. With the former 
were Capt Romulo Gualdrapa, Capt Edgardo Cabalquinto, Lt Santos 
Petaho, and 2Lt Adonis Fernandez. 485 

From late morning till noontime, radio reports were heard about 
ongoing negotiations between government forces and the rebels. DZRH 
reported the negotiations between Capt Javier representing the govern- 
ment, and for the rebels, Lt Paterno Reynato Padua of the Scout Rangers 



CHAPTER V 307 



and Lt Roily Tan of the Marines. However, the negotiations were 
interrupted due to the presence of civilians ("uziseros")*** 

DZRH also reported that Marine Sgt Lloma, one of the APC personnel, 
defected to the rebel side, allegedly because, their leader Mfy Marcelino 
Lakap was gone and they had no support nor reinforcement from Camp 
Aguinaldo. Speaker Ramon Mitra, through the radio, urged Sgt Lloma 
to take charge of the command and not to defect 487 Subsequent infor- 
mation disclosed that this was a rebel psywar tactic. 

At noontime, rebel troops posted at EDSA corner Quezon Blvd were 
able to surround two government APCs near the Ninoy Aquino Park. 488 

Rafael Recto Arrives at PTV-4 

At about 8:00 a.m., rebel soldiers under Lt Col Eduardo Kapunan 
took over PTV-4 and establi shed a temporary command post in the office 
of Network Manager Conrado limcaoco on the third floor. 489 Around 
2:00 p.m. , a group led by Rafael Recto arrived at PTV-4. With Recto were 
Joaquin Rodriguez and Edgardo Castro, an official of the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and one of those involved in processing the issuance of 
a passport to Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr. Both Rodriguez and Castro testi- 
fied that they accompanied Recto to PTV-4 because he (Recto) claimed 
his daughter Plinky was at the adjoining ABS-CBN station and he 
wanted to fetch her. 

According to PTV-4 Chief Security Officer, Orlando Fontanilla, 
Recto's group was allowed entry into the compound by a rebel Scout 
Ranger officer who instructed him to bring Recto and his group to the 
third floor of PTV-4. Fontanilla complied and brought Recto and his 
companions to Limcaoco's office where Recto inquired from the rebel 
officers there about a press conference. 490 One of the rebels replied, 
according to Fontanilla, "wala daw presscon, walang order na may 
presscon nm (There's no presscon. We have no orders for a presscon). 
With that, Recto and his group departed from PTVM. Fontanilla 
testified that Recto neither entered the premises of ABS-CBN nor asked 
him about Plinky. In their testimony before the Commission, Rodriguez 
and Castro also confirmed that Recto did not enter ABS-CBN. 

In his sworn statement, Fontanilla stated that he saw Lito Gorospe 
in the Master Control booth of ABS-CBN with a written statement which 
Gorospe intended to read and 12 videocassettes which he would show, if 
they were able to operate ABS-CBN. 492 However, both ABS-CBN and 
PTV-4 had been disabled so none of these events took place. 



308 



Government Troops Retake PTV-4 

The rebel soldiers left the PTV-4 premises at 9:00 p.m. 488 

Rebel MBLT 4 troops which occupied PTV-4, moved to Ortigas 
Avenue. 494 Some of them regrouped at the nearby JUSMAG area while 
the others, at the vicinity of Camelot Hotel. 496 

• At 9 :30 p.m. , Salvador, and a composite team from GHQ, reoccupied 
PTV-4. 496 At 10:00 p.m., 2Lt Javillonar returned to PTV-4 and inspected 
the building together with the Administrative Manager, Emmanuel de 
Asis. They discovered that the vault (of money) had been forced open. 
The lockers of the soldiers assigned at the station and the armory in the 
general manager's room on ^he third floor were likewise ransacked. 
Guns, ammunition, and personal belongings of the soldiers were gone. 497 

At 11:30 p.m., Maj Ducusin, CO MBLT 2, left Camp Aguinaldo and 
established blocking positions at the vicinity of corner EDSA and East 
Avenue, Quezon City. 498 

C.6.C. 2 December 

At 1:30 a.m., rebel troops left ABS-CBN for Timog/Circle, accom- 
panied by some civilians in T-shirts and "maong* pants and escorted by 
two V-150s. 499 One of the V-150s (Body No. 401) developed engine 
trouble and was abandoned. Elements of the Security Battalion under 
MSgt Tangonan recovered the V-150 and towed it to their HQ. 600 

By 5:00 a.m., MGen Ramon Montano ordered BGen Cesar Nazareno, 
RECOM 3 Commander, to block all enemy forces withdrawing from 
PTV-4 heading towards Camps Crame and Aguinaldo. 501 

By 6:00 a.m., the 34 MC MBLT 4 under Lt Cal had moved to the 
Camp Aguinaldo area near White Plains to join their comrades. 502 

D. Camp Aguinaldo and its Vicinity 

It appears that the ultimate objective of the rebels were to take over 
Camp Aguinaldo because this meant the fall of the symbolic seat of 
military power and to gain control of the center for AFP military 
operations. Inside Camp Aguinaldo are the headquarters of the AFPs 
top military* officers, the main office of the Department of National 
Defense, the Logistics Command (LOGCOM) which controls and supplies 
the fire power, ammunitions and equipment requirement of the entire 



CHAPTER V 309 



AFP, and the Joint Operations Center (JOC) which Col Edgardo 
Batenga, CO 701 Bde, describes as "the heart and soul of GHQ AFP." 603 

D.l. Pre 30 November Events 

Intelligence Receives Mixed Signals of a Coup 

As early as June 1989, the AFP Intelligence Office (J2) received 
information on a joint Zumel-Honasan attempt to destabilize govern- 
ment on the first or second week of June 1989. The plans did not 
materialize, although there was information of recruitment inside 
PAF bases by ex-Lt Col Neon Ebuen. 604 

Information on recruitment continued to be received up to August 
1989 when Honasan was reportedly meeting unidentified top military 
officers and government officials. 606 During this month, the Bureau of 
Customs uncovered a shipment of one million primers used for the 
manufacture of ammunitions for .45 cal guns consigned to Honasan. The 
Bureau turned them over to the PC Firearms and Explosives Unit 
(FEU). 506 

Around 26 November, NCRDC Intelligence under Col Benjamin 
Libarnes received information that a coup would be staged either on 1- 
5 December, 16-21 December, or 28-31 December of 1989, or 15-16 
January 1990 by the joint forces of Marcos- Ver Loyalists and the RAM- 
HF. 

There were also information about other plots. Military intelligence 
believed that the so-called "Peoples' March for Justice" from Ilocos Norte 
to Manila from 26 October to 4 November was preparatory to a coup. 
When the coup failed to materialize, a second "Peoples 1 March for 
Justice" was planned for 16-20 December with the Pambansang 
Salubungan Para Sa Katarungan (PSPK), an affiliate of the Movement 
for Filipino Ideology, as the front group. 507 

NCRDC Intelligence further reported that the security force under 
Gamos assigned to Vice President Laurel was preparing plans, code 
names and numbers, sketches of streets and buildings, and vehicles for 
a coup. The most compelling evidence was the information given by the 
wife of Lt Rodolfo Cachola, who was undergoing Scout Ranger training 
in San Quintin, Pangasinan. 508 Upon instruction of her husband, Mrs 
Cachola revealed to the Philippic Marines that her husband and 
another officer who was also undergoing training, were called to the 
PSRR HQ in Fort Bonifacio and were briefed on the forthcoming coup. 509

Infiltration from Within 

On rotation, a Senior Command Duty Officer (SCDO) is designated 
for the 77-hectare Camp Aguinaldo Complex. By practice, the SCDCs 
lasts for a period of two weeks. 610 A Command Duty Officer (CDO) at 
LOGCOM is likewise designated. On 30 November, rebel officers 
Commo Domingo Calajate and Cmdr Proceso Maligalig, Operations 
Officer LOGCOM, were SCDO of Camp Aguinaldo and the CDO of 
LOGCOM respectively. LOGCOM occupies two-thirds of the land area 
of Camp Aguinaldo. AFP GHQ occupies the remainder. 

In September 1989, Navy Capt Manuel Ison, the newly installed CO 
of the Maintenance Depot of the AFP LOGCOM, completely reorganized 
and reshuffled the unit, replacing key personnel with his own. His 
recommendee, Lt Joel Cantos, took charge of the keys to the warehouses 
which contain oils, lubricants and spare parts. Ison also replaced some 
of the personnel of the Supply Accountability Office (SAO) with his own 
men and at the same time restricted Josue Duque, SAO Officer, from 
entering the warehouse. 

On 29 November, troops started to mass in Camp Aguinaldo. 
NCRDC Intelligence failed to assess the importance of the arrival at 
LOGCOM that day of a Marine company from MBLT l 511 based in 
Bulacan headed by Capt Wilfredo Codiacal, EX-O, with a V-150. Pfc 
Marcelino Peralta said that the company was ordered to proceed to 
LOGCOM by Capt Codiacal without revealing their mission. 612 This 
company first went to VAB, then proceeded to LOGCOM. Another 
Marine guard company, which was assigned to escort supplies to be 
picked up from LOGCOM, arrived on 30 November from Olongapo. 613 

D.2. 30 November 

At about 11:00 a.m., Col Thelmo Cunanan, CO 202 Bde 2 ID, came 
tothe office of Commo Virgilio Marcelo, CG GHHSC, and told the latter 
"There is gonna be a coup to be staged by the Marines and the Rangers". 
Thereupon, Marcelo mobilized all his troops and by 4:00 p.m., they were 
all ready. At the same time, he relayed the information to BGen Roman 
Gavino, Jr, AFP Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, and asked for 
confirmation. The latter could not confirm. 614 

* J^S m3 S P ' m " a gr ° Up ° f soldiers held a meeting at one of the houses 
at the Enlisted Men's Barrio inside Camp Aguinaldo near Gate 5. They 
discussed plans to ransack the Civil Relations Service (CRS) for arms. 
Commo Marcelo received information that ex-Lt Col Bibit's group was 
already inside the camp to seize its flrmnrips 



CHAPTER V 311 



Government Holds Top Command Conference 

The Tagaytay incident led Secretary Ramos, together with Gen de 
Villa, to call a Command Conference which was held at IS AFP in Camp 
Aguinaldo starting at 5:00 p.m. The General Staff, the major service 
commanders, BGen Cardones, BGen Cabanlig, BGen Orlando Antonio, 
CG NOLCOM, BGen Tereso Isleta, CG 15 SW, BGen Biazon, BGen 
Galido, BGen Loven Abadia, Commo Calajate and other major unit 
commanders attended the conference which lasted until 10:00 p.m. 516 

The major service commanders relayed to Gen de Villa their 
assessment of the military situation in relation to the previous day's 
attack by Scout Rangers on the AFP communication s system in Tagaytay 
City. After the conference, Gen de Villa informed the country through 
a nationwide broadcast that a coup d'etat was about to be carried out by 
rightist forces. He added though that it had been aborted. 516 

BGen Biazon, in order to augment the forces defending the camp, 
told Gen de Villa: "I am calling our reserve (MBLT 4) from Fort Bonifacio 
to Aguinaldo". 517 However, Biazon was told that his reserve MBLT 4 had 
gone over to the rebel side. 

That evening, Col Edgardo Batenga, CO 701 Bde, placed his command 
under BGen Biazon's control. Batenga went to Sta Rosa, Laguna to 
consolidate his forces. He told one of his battalion commanders, Lt Col 
Alejandro Lasan, CO 72 IB, to proceed to Camp Aguinaldo with two 
armored vehicles and to engage all rebel troops coming from the south. 615 

D.3. 1 December 

Early Signs of Rebel Activity at Camp Aguinaldo 

At 2:00 a.m., half of the First Marine Brigade Contingency Force left 
LOGCOM aboard two V-150s for Fort Bonifacio to join the rebels. 519 

By 3:00 a.m., some unidentified armed soldiers entered the AFP 
Finance Center (AFPFC) and woke up the enlisted men, saying the camp 
has been infiltrated. 620 The armed men allegedly forced them at gunpoint 
^ join their cause. 521 These men were ordered to join the mutineers by 
Capt Pimentel, a finance officer, on the pretext that the exercise was 
u para sa kinabukasan ng ating mga anak" (for our children's future), 
^ey gave the men M-16 guns and ammunition. They then took some 
AFPFC vehicles — three mini-cruisers and onehi-ace van — and proceeded 



312 



towards the Enlisted Men's Barrio near Gate 5 522 Sgt Borbe, one of those 
in the group, said he saw many armed troops. 

One of the vehicles was driven by Cpl Lucio Cabil of AFPFC. With 
him were SSgt Manlangit, SSgt Aloquin, and Wenceslao Lagradilla. The 
others riding the other vehicles included SSgt Asuncion, SSgt Borbe, Sgt 
Juni, Sgt Aguirre, Cpl Encotro, Edwin Velcorsa, Sixto Rodriguez and 
others. The men got off when they reached the area near Gate S. 523 At 
Gate 5, several government soldiers suddenly arrived with a V- 150 and 
arrested them. Only then, claimed SSgt Asuncion, did he realize that he 
was with the rebel group. 524 

At the same time, about 50 armed military men were reportedly seen 
at the vicinity of Lambat Disco and Euro Car Sales near the corner of 
EDSA and P Tuazon St in Cubao, Quezon City. 525 TSgt Henry Aquino 
recognized former NISA Lt Col Rodolfo Tor as one of the armed men who 
fired upon the NCRDC intelligence team monitoring Euro Car Sales. 526 

Ransack of the Civil Relations Service Office 

Inside the GHQ premises, rebel troops started to mass. The AFP 
Civil Relations Service (CRS) armory was ransacked by 12 to 14 armed 
men at 4:30 a.m. 527 Sgt Macario Mabazza narrated that, while sleeping 
at the CRS, armed men wearing masks woke him up and forced him to 
jump over the wall and flee. 628 Some of the men were recognized as 
organic personnel of CRS. Later it was discovered that various firearms 
were stolen. 

At about 5:00 a.m., some Military Police (MP), believed to be rebels, 
arrived at Camp Aguinaldo aboard a 6 x 6 truck, a pick-up and a V-150. 
However, Capt Duque rounded them up and brought them to the 
grandstand of Camp Aguinaldo, then to the HSC stockade. Confiscated 
from the rebel MPs were four M-14 rifles and one M-16 rifle. 

First Rebel Airstrikes at Camps Aguinaldo and Crame 

As the rebel MPs were being brought to the stockade at about 7:00 
a.m., a rebel Sikorsky and Tora-Tora planes started bombarding Camp 
Aguinaldo. 529 Sgt Aloquin, along with the other detainees, escaped as 
everyone scampered to save their own lives. 530 LCdr Vicente Botero, CO, 
HHSG instructed his men to defend NCRDC HQ. 

At 7:00 a.m., Biazon ordered the establishment of a Tactical Command 
Post at Camp Aguinaldo Grandstand in view of reports that rebel planes 



OIO 



would hit Malacanang and military camps. 531 By 8:00 am., this command 
pose was set up. 532 

Later, government F-5 jets were seen encircling the rebel Tora-Tora 
planes. The two rebel Tora-Tora planes augmented by a Sikorsky 
helicopter, again attacked and bombed Camp Aguinaldo and Camp 
Crame at 9: 15 a.m. 533 HPC in Camp Crame was hit while Gen de Villa's 
residence and other buildings in Camp Aguinaldo were razed to the 
ground. 534 

At 9:45 a.m., a rebel Sikorsky helicopter fired rockets at Camp 
Crame hitting the Narcotics Command, HPC, and the COMMEL 
buildings. The PC-INP forces in Camp Crame fired at the aircraft using 
.30 and .50 cal machineguns. Because of the burning of HPC, a tactical 
and operations command post was organized at the Constabulary 
Security Group (CSG) building and at the Constabulary Adjutant 
Building. 536 

The rebel Tora-Toras and the Sikorsky helicopter again went back, 
to strafe and bomb different strategic areas inside Camp Aguinaldo after 
bombing Malacafiang, Camp Crame and strafing PTV-4. 636 

Commo Domingo Calajate Convinces LOGCOM to Join Rebels 

At 8:00 a.m., Commo Calajate convened the officers and soldiers of 
LOGCOM at the front of the LOGCOM main building. At the meeting, 
Calajate said that there was already a failure in the chain of command 
and that GHQ was no longer functioning as of 4:00 a.m. He further 
revealed his affiliation with the rebels after telling them that he was the 
highest link in the AFFs chain of command. He then said that he was 
joining the rebel cause and urged "everyone to do the same". At the 
meeting, Calajate asked the men who were with him. 537 Many raised 
their hand. Among them were Cmdr Maligalig Jr, Capt Manuel Ison 
U Col Narciso Dauz, Lt Col Nicolas Cabrera, Maj Raul Heredia, and 
some doctors and nurses. 538 All those who did not want to join were given 
15minutestoleave. Col Manuel Mariano, Deputy Commander LOGCOM, 
after reflecting, approached Calajate and told him that he would not join 
the rebels, 539 after which Mariano left. 

The other soldiers were ordered to take measures to secure LOGCOM 
against government forces. 540 Pfc Antonio Kabigting said that Calajate 
ordered them to defend the camp. Lt Col Ramon Palad gave Kabigting 
masking tape to attach on his left sleeve as a countersign. Maligalig, also 
wearing a countersign with a drawing on it, told him and the men to 



314 



withdraw firearms and bullets and secure their offices. 541 Calajate, 
meanwhile, ordered the Philippine flaginverted. At this point, LOGCOM 
stopped supplying NCRDC with ammunition. Calajate also instructed 
that the gate at the Administration Building be barricaded. 542 

Also at the meeting with Calajate were Col Francisco Deocaris and 
Capt Manuel Santos. After the meeting, they returned to the Logistics 
Training Center, Fearing that there may be instructions to shoot those 
who went out . of the camp, Deocaris stayed put and instructed Capt 
Santos to secure the office and safeguard their things. 543 

Cmdr Maligalig Takes Over JOC 

After the meeting, Maligalig with 50 LOGCOM personnel went to 
the JOC located nearby and tried to take it by force. When BGen 
Lisandro Abadia, AFP Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations (J3), heard 
this, he and troops from 72 IB under Lt Col Alejandro Lasan, began 
operations to retake JOC. 544 JOC was then surrounded by Cmdr 
Maligalig's troops. Lisandro Abadia confronted the rebels at about 11:00 
a.m. and without a shot being fired, Maligalig and his renegades 
withdrew to LOGCOM. Some laid down their arms after the confronta- 
tion. 545 JOC was again safely in GHQ's control. 

Government Consolidates Troops 

Realizing Camp Aguinaldo's vulnerability on 1 December due to lack 
of men and defection ofhis reserves, Biazon had to wait for reinforcements 
from the commands of BGens Blando, Galido, Nazareno, Carbonell, 
Abella and Juachon. 

First of the government reinforcements to arrive in Camp Aguinaldo 
were the 72 IB troops of Lt Col Lasan, followed shortly by additional 
soldiers led by Lasan's commander, Col Batenga of the 701 Bde. Their 
first task was to assist BGen Lisandro Abadia to clear JOC of rebels. 
They succeeded and even captured Maligalig. However, after the rebel 
Tora-Toras attacked, Maligalig escaped. 546 

Batenga's and Lasan's troops were divided: half was assigned to 
retake LOGCOM and the other half to defend the grandstand. Just 
about then, troops led by BGen Javier Carbonell, CG 2 ID, and troops 
from AFP TRACOM under BGen Juachon, arrived and took over the 
attack of LOGCOM. 547 



CHAPTER V 315 



Over the telephone, BGen Carbonell tried to persuade Commo 
Calajate to surrender. When the latter refused, the government forces 
advanced. 548 There was a firefight followed by the surrender of the 

rebels. 

During the firefight, some of the 400 officers and men at LOGCOM 
started to escape. At 2:30 p.m., Calajate, Maligalig, Ison, and 2Lt Ragasa 
escaped on board Calajate's staff car. 549 They proceeded to VAB. 550 By 
3:00 p.m., the flagpole which originally had the inverted flag was now 
replaced by a white one. Col Edgardo Kasilag, Chief of Staff of AFP 
LOGCOM, told the men defending LOGCOM that Calajate had left, and 
that they were to follow the chain of command. 551 Kasilag led them in 
surrendering to BGens Lisandro Abadia and Carbonell at the CSG 
grandstand. 552 The surrenderees were processed by Col Manuel Mariano, 
Acting Chief of AFP LOGCOM. The troops from the 701 Bde secured 
LOGCOM by 4:00 p.m. 

RECOM 3 troops arrived at 5:27 p.m. to reinforce Camp Aguinaldo. 

The order to consolidate troops from the 1st Marine Brigade (1 
MBde) under BGen Cesar Abella deployed in Bulacan was given the 
night before. By 11:45 a.m., one battalion had arrived in Norzagaray. 
The second battalion was ready to move from their headquarters in 
Malabon by 2:00 p.m. The two battalions, MBLT 1 and MBLT 2, plus 
three separate companies, 52 MC, 61 MC and the HQS Coy, left 
Norzagaray by 4:00 p.m. These Marines arrived in Camp Aguinaldo at 
7:00 p.m. 553 

During the whole day, 202 Bde and 203 Bde under Col Thelmo 
Cunanan and Col Clemente Mariano, respectively, were consolidating 
their troops preparatory to moving them to the vicinity of Camp 
Aguinaldo. 554 

MGen Montano ordered a PC Special Action Force (SAF), acting as 
a reserve and maneuver force, to proceed to Camp Crame with armor 
elements. The PC and elements of the WPD were directed to deploy 
blocking forces. 555 

Rebel Marine Troops Start to Consolidate 

The major force of the rebels composed of the Marines from MBLT 
4 and their armor vehicles started to consolidate at Camp Aguinaldo 
by late afternoon of 1 December.

withdraw firearms and bullets and secure their offices. 641 Calajate, 
meanwhile, ordered the Philippine flagin verted. At this point, LOGCOM 
stopped supplying NCRDC with ammunition. Calajate also instructed 
that the gate at the Administration Building be barricaded. 642 

Also at the meeting with Calajate were Col Francisco Deocaris and 
Capt Manuel Santos. After the meeting, they returned to the Logistics 
Training Center. Fearing that there may be instructions to shoot those 
who went out of the camp, Deocaris stayed put and instructed Capt 
Santos to secure the office and safeguard their things. 643 

Cmdr Maligalig Takes Over JOC 

After the meeting, Maligalig with 50 LOGCOM personnel went to 
the JOC located nearby and tried to take it by force. When BGen 
Lisandro Abadia, AFP Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations (J3), heard 
this, he and troops from 72 IB under Lt Col Alejandro Lasan, began 
operations to retake JOC. 544 JOC was then surrounded by Cmdr 
Maligalig's troops. Lisandro Abadia confronted the rebels at about 11:00 
a.m. and without a shot being fired, Maligalig and his renegades 
withdrew to LOGCOM. Some laid down their arms after the confronta- 
tion. 646 JOC was again safely in GHQ's control. 

Government Consolidates Troops 

Realizing Camp Aguinaldo's vulnerability on 1 December due to lack 
of men and defection ofhis reserves, Biazon had to wait for reinforcements 
from the commands of BGens Blando, Galido, Nazareno, Carbonell, 
Abella and Juachon. 

First of the government reinforcements to arrive in Camp Aguinaldo 
were the 72 IB troops of Lt Col Lasan, followed shortly by additional 
soldiers led by Lasan's commander, Col Batenga of the 701 Bde. Their 
first task was to assist BGen Lisandro Abadia to clear JOC of rebels. 
They succeeded and even captured Maligalig. However, after the rebel 
Tora-Toras attacked, Maligalig escaped. 646 

were divided: half was assigned to 
to defend the grandstand. Just 
tyier Carbonell, CG 2 ID, and troops 
chon, arrived and took over the 




CHAPTER V 315 



Over the telephone, BGen Carbonell tried to persuade Commo 
Calajate to surrender. When the latter refused, the government forces 
advanced. 64 * There was a firefight followed by the surrender of the 
rebels. 

During the firefight, some of the 400 officers and men at LOGCOM 
started to escape. At 2:30 p.m., Calajate, Maligalig, Ison, and 2Lt Ragasa 
escaped on board Cal^jate's staff car. 649 They proceeded to VAB. 660 By 
3:00 p.m., the flagpole which originally had the inverted flag was now 
replaced by a white one. Col Edgardo Kasilag, Chief of Staff of AFP 
LOGCOM, told the men defending LOGCOM that Calajate had left, and 
that they were to follow the chain of command. 661 Kasilag led them in 
surrendering to BGens Lisandro Abadia and Carbonell at the CSG 
grandstand. 652 The surrenderees were processed by Col Manuel Mariano, 
Acting Chief of AFP LOGCOM. The troops from the 701 Bde secured 
LOGCOM by 4:00 p.m. 

RECOM 3 troops arrived at 5:27 p.m. to reinforce Camp Aguinaldo. 

The order to consolidate troops from the 1st Marine Brigade (1 
MBde) under BGen Cesar Abella deployed in Bulacan was given the 
night before. By 11:45 a.m., one battalion had arrived in Norzagaray. 
The second battalion was ready to move from their headquarters in 
Malabon by 2:00 p.m. The two battalions, MBLT 1 and MBLT 2, plus 
three separate companies, 52 MC, 61 MC and the HQS Coy, left 
Norzagaray by 4:00 p.m. These Marines arrived in Camp Aguinaldo at 
7:00 p.m. 563 

During the whole day, 202 Bde and 203 Bde under Col Thelmo 
Cunanan and Col Clemente Mariano, respectively, were consolidating 
their troops preparatory to moving them to the vicinity of Camp 
Aguinaldo. 664 

MGen Montano ordered a PC Special Action Force (SAF), acting as 
a reserve and maneuver force, to proceed to Camp Crame with armor 
elements. The PC and elements of the WPD were directed to deploy 
blocking forces. 666 

Rebel Marine Troops Start to Consolidate 

The major force of the rebels composed of the Marines from MBLT 
4 and their armor vehicles started to consolidate at Camp Aguinaldo 
by late afternoon of 1 December. 



316 



By early evening, the rebel Marines at Gate 3 of Camp Aguinaldo 
started moving to the Mormon Church area, together with the tanks. 660 
At 10:00 p.m., three Marine companies (HQ Coy, 4 MC, 24 MC) MBLT 
4, supported by tanks and armor vehicles and led by M^j de la Peiia and 
2Lt Delfin Actas, moved from VAB through EDSA towards Camp 
Aguinaldo. Shooting ensued when these troops moved through the 
overpass by Mantrade Bldg in Makati. 557 The Marines reached the 
EDSA-Ortigas Avenue intersection by 1 1:00 p.m., after breaking through 
the blockade at Guadalupe bridge set up by Regional Special Action 
Force. The 701 Bde and elements of the 1st MBde, established blocking 
positions at the intersection of EDSA-Ortigas Avenue to prevent enemy 
movements towards Camp Aguinaldo. When they reached the White 
Plains area by midnight, government forces engaged them in a firefight 
which resulted in the death of Lt Ireneo Galigana on the rebel side. 558 

D.4. 2 December 

At 1:00 a.m., the 34 MC and 44 MC, also of MBLT 4, joined other 
rebel Marine units in White Plains 559 area and came under attack by 
government aircrafts. Some of the rebel Marines took shelter in nearby 
residences, as well as in the Christ the King Parish in Pasig. 560 

The Second Wave - Breaking through the Barricade 

To fortify defensive positions, Maj Amando Melo, CO MBLT 1, 
moved his Command Group Bravo Coy from EDSA-Ortigas Avenue to 
the Green Meadows- White Plains area. 561 BGen Cesar Abella, CG 1 
MBde, dispatched two V-150s (with body nos. M418 and M421) to 
augment the blocking forces of MBLT l. 562 MBLT 2 under Maj Edgardo 
Ducusin relocated their blocking position from EDSA-East Avenue in 
Quezon City to EDSA-Aurora Blvd. 563 

Seeing the blockade of two 6x6 trucks set up by Maj Melo's forces, 
rebel MBLT 4 officers led by Maj Antonio Bisenio and Capt Calimag 
sought to speak with Maj Melo. Eventually, negotiations transpired 
between Melo and Gojo with the former appealing for the MBLT 4 to 
return to Fort Bonifacio. Gojo, on the other hand, along with Lt Col 
Felimon Gasmin, Msys Bisenio, Franklin Casipit, and Capt Ariel Querubin 
tried to convince Melo and his men to join them. The rebels proved more 
persuasive. Forty-four enlisted men of Maj Melo, with one 

V-150(body 

no M421) defected to the rebel side. 564 

At 3:00 a.m., rebel attacks began. Using an LVT, Gojo's troops 
rammed through two 6x6 trucks blockade put up by the MBLT 1 forces 



chapter v 317 



at Katipunan corner White Plains Roads. 665 The LVT maneuvered along 
Katipunan Avenue followed by V-150s and went towards Gate l. 566 Lt 
Col Jerry Albano was reported seen manning a V-150 (body no F-302) 
moving together with another V-150 (body no F-301). 567 

Arrival of Government Reinforcements 

The 202 Bde and 203 Bde arrived at Guadalupe about 2:00 a.m. and 
linked up with the 701 Bde at corner Ortigas Avenue and EDSA Col 
Cunanan's 202 Bde, together with two LVTs, proceeded to the area of 
Green Meadows and White Plains. Their mission was to pursue the 
enemy and hit them from the rear. 566 By 5:00 a.m., the 202 Bde and 
Batenga's 701 Bde used 90 mm recoilless rifles and 105 mm Howitzers 
to deter the LVTs and V-150s from entering Camp Aguinaldo. 569 

NCRDC dispatched one company from AFP TRACOM under Cmdr 
Mario Ollero to augment the troops from MBLT 1 and the 203 Bde at 
corner Katipunan and White Plains to form a blocking force against 
enemy attempts to break through Gates 3, 4 and 5 570 The blocking force 
was subjected to assaults by rebel troops, and one LVT tried to break 
through at the concrete northeast wall near the AFP LOGCOM watertank. 
The rebel tanks continued to attack until 6:00 a.m. 

Government Air Strikes Continue 

At the same time, government air strikes continue. One UH-1H 
(Huey) helicopter piloted by Loven Abadia made three air strikes. Rebel 
gunfire woundedhis co-pilot. Likewise, PAFF-5s and Sikorsky helicopters 
made two airstrikes along Katipunan, droppingbombs at rebel positions. 
Unfortunately, the bombs hit the men of the 202 Bde under Col Cunanan 
who were mistaken for rebels since they were moving towards Boni 
Serrano St. 571 Five of Col Cunanan's men perished while 30 others were 
injured. Of this event, Col Cunanan relates 

The Chief of Staff asked me to assemble the brigade and he went there and he 
apologized to the soldiers in public for the sad incident and he said . . . Gen de 
Villa said, 1 accept full responsibility for this'. And this was a very big boost to 
the morale of the soldiers. 17 * 

Arrival of Marine Troops from PTV-4 

The 34 MC MBLT 4 under Lt Cal, upon arriving at White Plains area 
in the morning, was attacked by government Sikorsky helicopters. To 
lessen their vulnerability to air attacks, Cal ordered his men to proceed 
^ Gate 1 of Camp Aguinaldo. 573 



318 



A number of rebels had become discouraged by this time. Some left 
their units and entered nearby houses, changed into civilian clothes, and 
joined other civilians in evacuating the area. 674 The rockets fired by the 
Sikorsky forced the soldiers to seek refuge in houses in White Plains. 875 
At 10:00 a.m., the NCRDC Tactical Command Post received telephone 
calls from rebel Marine soldiers at the Mormon Church negotiating for 
surrender. 576 

Government aircrafts continued strafing, firingrockets, and bombing 
rebel positions at various times of the day. 577 

The Third Wave - More Attacks by Rebels 

The subsequent sporadic burst of rebel artillery fire hit the JOC 
compound. Tasked to defend the GHQ area, 578 the 72 IB troops under Lt 
Col Lasan received information that enemy Marines with LVT support 
were on their way to assault their positions at 4:30 p.m. 579 Together with 
the soldiers from the 203 Bde, they repulsed the rebel offensive which 
attempted to break through the AFP LOGCOM perimeter on Katipunan 
Avenue. More shooting occurred until 7:00 p.m. 580 

Camp Aguinaldo Defense Plan Implemented 

A conference was held at about 8:30 p.m. to coordinate plans for the 
defense of Camp Aguinaldo and offensive action against rebel positions. 
At the ISAFP Battle Staff room, de Villa and Ramos met the COs of the 
203 Bde, 70 1 Bde, and the PC SAF Commander. The 203 Bde was tasked 
to secure the AFP LOGCOM area. 581 Elements from the GHQ, HSC, 203 
Bde, MSG and the trainees of the AFP TRACOM under Col Yamzon 
would secure Camp Aguinaldo. The 72 IB was assigned as a screening 
force. 582 

At 11:30 p.m., the government launched its counter attack. BGen 
Biazon directed one section of the weapons platoon of 72 IB under 2Lt 
Miravello Miranda to counter attack the advancing rebel forces at 
LOGCOM. They immobilized one rebel LVT with two shots of their 90 
RR. A second LVT withdrew after encounteringheavy fire from Miranda's 
troops. Miranda then re-directed the artillery fire at rebel positions at 
the Veteran's building. 583 



CHAPTER V 319 



DJ5. 3 December 

The Final Wave - Massive Assault of Rebels 

By early morning of 3 December, the rebels prepared their most 
massive offensive to take over Camp Aguinaldo. Heavy gunbursts of 
different calibers, cannons, as well as mortars were heard all over Camp 
Aguinaldo. 584 The 34 MC under Lt Cal persisted in entering the Camp 
through Gate 1 at about 1:00 a.m. But as they neared the gate, they were 
repelled by mortar fire. 586 

At the same time, more than a thousand RAM-HF soldiers coming 
from White Plains started simultaneous attacks at GHQ with supporting 
fire from 81 mm mortars, 105 mm Howitzers, V-150s and three LVTs. 586 
The preparation fires were followed by ground assaults, spearheaded by 
tanks and armor vehicles on the northern and eastern perimeter. 587 The 
rebels intensified their effort to break through Gate l. 588 

Other rebel forces initiated assaults using combined artillery and 
mortar attacks to enter Camp Aguinaldo alternating between Gates 1 
and 2 near LOGCOM. The men of the 203 Bde under Clemente Mariano 
defended the gates with heavy fire, 589 causing the attacking Marines to 
retreat. 590 

The government fortified their defense positions. The 32 MC, MSG, 
which arrived earlier from PTV-4 retaliated with their 105 mm Howitzer 
and hit one of the LVTs. 591 Recoilless rifle fire from the troops from GHQ 
HSC and the 701 Bde and 105 mm Howitzer fire from the 1 MBde and 
the 202 Bde repulsed the LVTs. The troops of Maj de la Pena were able 
to enter Camp Aguinaldo behind the burning LVT and took positions at 
the St Ignatius Chapel, AFPCES and the GHQ Medical Dispensary. The 
rest of the rebel forces withdrew and consolidated atl8th and 20th 
Avenues in Cubao. 

Surrender Feelers Sent 

By 5:30 a.m., surrender feelers through Lt Col Rodolfo Gallardo, 
Camp Aguinaldo Post Chaplain, were received from Maj de la Pena, who 
with his men were trapped at the area of St Ignatius Chapel. 592 

At 9:00 a.m., negotiations pushed through with the assistance of Col 
Daranchang. At first, Maj de la Pena refused to surrender, vowing to 
%ht to the last man. However, Col Daranchang tried to talk him out of 
his decision, warning him that Biazon was ready to give the signal to 



320 



"wipe them out." 693 At 11:00 a.m., about 203 Marine officers and men 
from 44 MC, 24 MC, 34 MC, and 4 MC led by dela Pena and Calimag 
surrendered. 694 

At4:00p.m., Ramos and de Villa held a press conference to formally 
announce the government victory. The Government reported that 
NCRDC and other units deployed 6,932 men. They said, government 
forces suffered one officer and 31 enlisted men killed in action, 29 officers 
and 224 enlisted men wounded in action. 596 

The Government also reported that rebel forces suffered one officer 
and 16 enlisted men killed in action, and 8 officers and 84 enlisted men 
wounded in action. A total of 390 firearms, 15 military vehicles, six 
tanks, and a civilian delivery truck were recovered from the rebels. 698 

E. Fort Magsaysay - Greenhills 

B.l. Before 30 November 

Various Activities at Fort Magsaysay and BGen Blando 

BGen Marcelo Blando became the CO of the 7th Infantry Division (7 
ID) based in Fort Magsaysay, Palayan City, Nueva Ecija, on 8 August 
1989. In the August 1987 attempted coup, Honasan's main force came 
from Fort Magsaysay. It is also the training center of the Scout Rangers 
and one of the venues of Exercise Balikatan 1989. The area of operation 
of the 7 ID cover the Army units deployed in the provinces of Aurora, 
Nueva Ecija, Pangasinan, Tarlac, Bataan, Zambales and parts of Rizal, 
Cavite, and Laguna. 597 

Prior to taking command of 7 ID, Blando was CG of the FSRR and 
was given by the Scout Rangers the code name of "Tatang One". 698 

By October 1989, using his prerogative as CG 7 ID, Blando removed 
the operational control of the First Scout Ranger Company from Col 
Oswaldo Villanueva, Brigade Commander, 703 Bde, and placed them 
under 56 IB of Lt Col Levy Zamora. 5 " 

Blando's closeness to Zamora, Lt Col Arsenio Tecson, CO 68 IB and 
Maj Alfredo Oliveros, CO 24 IB, was shown by his frequent visits to their 
commands which were done without the normal advise to their respective 
brigade commanders. 600 



CHAPTER V 321 



Col Villanueva noticed this "closeness" between Zamora and Blando 
to the point that there were several instances when Blando would visit 
56 IB and Zamora without informing him. Col Villanueva testified that 
before the December 1989 attempted coup, BGen Blando seemed to act 
suspiciously. He said 

I do not have any premonition whatsoever, on his [BGen BlanoVs] participation " 
in the coup d'etat but it was quite strange that whenever he visits my unit, he 
does not tell me, [he] just tried [to] proceed directly to 66th IB that is Lt Col 
Zamora and then Lt Col Zamora will not also tell me what they took up together 
and it is not only once that he did it, he [did] it repeatedly . . . M1 

Sometime in September 1989, MGen Cacanando visited the 703 Bde. 
When he found out that Maj Ernie Amboy, who was involved in the 
August 1987 coup attempt, was the EX-0 of Zamora, he directed that 
Amboy be assigned elsewhere. Cacanando also found out that the 56 IB 
had transferred four sacks of firearms to the rear command post. This 
was reported to Blando, but the latter seemed unconcerned. 602 

Blando ordered the 73 IB under Lt Col Rolen Erasmo pulled out from 
the control of the 703 Bde and had it assigned to Fort Magsaysay for 
retraining and cross training with US Armed Forces under Exercise 
Balikatan. 603 There were reports that the RP-US Exercise Balikatan 
was used as a cover for the build up and movement of troops by the 
rebels. 604 

Sometime in October 1989, President Aquino visited Fort Magsaysay. 
Col Villanueva, who was the Honor Guard Commander of the Brigade for 
the ceremonies in honor of the President, narrated 

■ . . When President Aquino was our guest, one of the honor guards there [was] 
caught with one live ammo inside the chambers of his rifle, although we were 
told that BGen Blando himself was the one who inspected personally the guards 
before they were called in front of the Division headquarters.* 01 

The soldier, from whom the live ammo was discovered, was 
investigated by the Inspector General and Provost Marshall of 7 ID. 606 
The report that Blando himself inspected the guard came from Col 
Josefino Manayao, 1 ID Assistant Chief of Staff for Education and 
Training. 607 

At Fort Magsaysay, at about 6:00 p.m. of 30 November, Lt Lucero 
informed Blando that Maj Nestor Senares and ex-Lt Col Eduardo 
Matillano, both of whom were involved in the 1987 coup attempt, were 
sighted in Cabanatuan City.

E.2. SO November 

Order for Roadblocks in Nueva Ecija 

At 1:15 p.m., troops in full combat gear aboard 6x6 trucks, one jeep 
and one pick-up were monitoredby Nueva Ecija Constabulary Command 
under Col Ferdinand Lagman, PC Provincial Commander, passing 
through Nueva Ecija. After verifying the movements with Lt Col 
Artemio Cacal PA, based in Camp Aquino, Tarlac, Col Lagman learned 
that the movement was authorized. 608 

However, Lagman entertained doubts which made him take other 
actions. He testified 

... in my mind however, I waa already in doubt because said troops were in fall 
combat gear. So I [gave] instructions to all my company commanders to 
implement OPLAN Regal 609 and at the same time informed the Regional 
Tactical Operations Center of my action. I requested clearance to implement 
OPLAN Regal immediately. I also instructed my intelligence officer to proceed 
to the Commanding General of the 7 ID, who is BGen Blando, to find out if such 
troops came from his unit." 10 

Meanwhile, in the afternoon, Lagman found out that no troops from 
the 7 ID moved out of Fort Magsaysay . He concluded that the units he 
saw were Scout Rangers coming from Isabela and he became convinced 
that the troop movements were signals of a forthcoming coup. Hence, at 
11:40 p.m., after conferring again with his operations and intelligence 
officers, he instructed all company commanders to establish roadblocks 
as part of OPLAN Regal. 

Usingtrucks and other vehicles as obstacles, PC elements established 
road blocks along Maharlika Highway in Nueva Ecija particularly in 
Brgy Malasin in San Jose, Brgy Baloc in Sto Domingo, Brgy Sumacabin 
Cabanatuan City and in Brgy Castellano in Gapan. 611 Verbal instructions 
were given to Capt Brigido Undan, CO 182 PC Coy, to establish road 
blocks at Brgy Kita-Kita in San Jose City. Capt Undan also ordered Lt 
Ronald Estilles to establish road blocks at Brgy Cebar. 612 

E.3. 1 December 

Consolidation of Troops under Blando 

Lt Col Rolen Erasmo, while sleeping at the bivouac area at Fort 
Magsaysay, was awakened at about midnight of 30 November and told 
to report to the Office of the Operations Officer, at the Division HQ to 
attend an emergency conference with Blando. 



CHAPTER V 323 



At 1:30 a.m., Blando held an emergency conference at the Division 
HQ in Fort Magsaysay, attended by the General and Special Staffs and 
Post Unit Commanders. Blando, in civilian clothes but fully armed, gave 
instructions to prepare to reinforce government forces in Camp Aguinaldo. 

PC SAF Company Leaves Fort Magsaysay 

At 2:00 a.m. , a PC Special Action Force (PCSAF) Company led by Lt 
Dennis Peter Pena, composed of six officers and 54 enlisted personnel 
left Fort Magsaysay for Manila aboard a 6 x 6 truck, a Kennedy jeep, a 
communication van, a Ford Fiera and Dodge van. MSgt Mendoza, Duty 
Officer NOLCOM Operations Office, called up Fort Magsaysay to verify 
the movement of the troops. NOLCOM cleared the movement They 
reached Manila without any incident but it was not clear what happened 
to them there or what they did. 613 

In the meanwhile, BGen Antonio, CG NOLCOM, contacted CSAFP 
de Villa, and was directed to organize and lead one battalion from Fort 
Magsaysay. The NCRDC COC also received a report from AFP JOC 
regarding the movement of the PC SAF. 6U 

Twenty minutes after the PC SAF left, CSAFP and NOLCOM called 
to hold the troops. The group, however, had already left and could not be 
recalled. 615 At 2:25 a.m., the NCRDC COC received a report from AFP 
JOC that NOLCOM has cancelled the movement of PC SAF. 616 This 
made the troop movement of the PC SAF unauthorized. 

Lt Col Erasmo's 73 IB Troops Mobilized 

At 6:00 a. m., Antonio called Blando to ask if the battalion was ready. 
By 8:00 a.m. , 73 IB under Lt Col Erasmo, composed of 15 officers and 294 
enlisted personnel, were already assembled at the grandstand. Blando 
briefed the men, asking them to support the duly constituted authority. 
According to Col Alejandro Trespeces, Chief of Staff 7 ID, Blando also 
insinuated that he might not leave or go with the troops to Manila. 

Erasmo commented that his troops could have moved for Manila by 
e ariy morning. However, no adequate transportation facilities for his 
entire battalion were available until 10:00 a.m., when cargo trucks 
arrived at Fort Magsaysay. Blando ordered Erasmo to proceed to GHQ 
m Camp Aguinaldo and then report to Lisandro Abadia at JOC for 
instructions. Later, Blando told Erasmo "Mahirap yata ang sitwasyon 
toMaynila (The situation in Manila is bad). I think we better stay put 



324 



Just stand by for any further orders". 617 Thus, Erasmo's troops did not 
move until after lunch. 

Mobilization of Scout Ranger Trainees 

According to Capt Herbert Avinante, Deputy Commander of the SR 
Training Center (SRTC) FSRR , Blando ordered him at about 8:00 a.m. 
to prepare a company of Rangers to go to Camp Aguinaldo. Capt 
Avinante claimed that the movement was to support GHQ upon orders 
of de Villa and Antonio. 618 It should be noted that since the SRTC is 
located at Colado Village inside Fort Magsay say, the 7 ID under Blando 
can use the Scout Ranger students for operations. Blando, however, 
denied giving such orders to Avinante, saying that the Scout Rangers 
merely attached themselves to his troops on their way to Manila. 61 * 

Avinante then ordered Lt Felipe Sangalang, Administrative Officer, 
SRTC to alert one company to be led by him. After 124 officers and men 
were assembled, they moved out from the SRTC to the 7 ID HQ, where 
they joined other troops from 73 IB. Other elements from 3 LABde and 
armor units from the Headquarters Service Battalion also joined the 
troops under Blando. 620 

Mobilization ofMaj Gutierrez's 71 IB Troops 

Because de Villa asked Blando for another battalion, Blando 
instructed his Operations Officer, Capt Baylon, to direct Maj Pedro 
Gutierrez, CO 71 IB, to consolidate his battalion from Munoz, Nueva 
Ecija and proceed to Fort Magsaysay. Upon receiving the orders, 
Gutierrez called for the different units of the 71 IB, composed of about 
250 officers and men, to regroup. 621 Gutierrez tried to reach his Brigade 
Commander, Col Villanueva, at his Command Post for instructions and 
guidance on what is happening. However, Col Villanueva was not 
there. 622 He was then at his quarters in Fort Bonifacio. By 9 :30 a.m. , the 
units of the 71 IB, except one company, had regrouped at Munoz, Nueva 
Ecija. 623 Capt Undan intercepted two platoons of soldiers belonging to C 
Coy, 7 1 IB under Lt Canes on board one 6x6 truck and two ten- wheeler 
trucks which were stopped by the road blocks set up at Brgy Malasin, 
San Jose City 624 Gutierrez went to Brgy Malasin checkpoint, and talked 
to Undan to intercede for the passage of his troops. Undan asked 
permission from his commander, Col Lagman, who granted clearance. 

Gutierrez arrived at Fort Magsaysay at 11:30 a.m. with 14 officers 
and 266 EPs. He reported to Blando at the Office of the Division 
SgtMajor. Blando was with Col Trespeces, Lt Col Josefino Manayao, Lt 



CHAPTER V 325 



Danilo Lucero, Lt Rafael Valencia and Capt Herbert Avinante. Blando 
directed Gutierrez to proceed to Metro Manila and report to NCRDC at 
Camp Aguinaldo but to return to Nueva Ecija if the situation does not 
permit. BGen Blando decided to accompany the 71 and 73 IBs. 625 

Helicopter Sightings at Fort Magsaysay 

During this time, the rebel Rangers in Fort Bonifacio were waiting 
for Blando to arrive by helicopter. There were unconfirmed reports that 
Blando would be CG PA if the coup succeeded. 626 At about 1:00 p m one 
Sikorsky helicopter gunship with white RAM-SFP markings on its side 
landed at the Aeroscout area in Fort Magsaysay. 627 This helicopter, 
believed to be refueling, was piloted by Lt Gregor Panelo, PAF. 62fi The 
helicopter took off at 3:00 p.m. without Blando and headed east of Fort 
Magsaysay. 629 It was later confirmed that this helicopter was the same 
one found abandoned and covered with dried leaves at Fort Magsaysay 
after the attempted coup. 630 

BGen Blando Prepares Troops for Convoy 

The troops from 73 IB and 71 IB were ready for movement by 1:30 
p.m. Blando gave a pep talk to the men at the 7 ID grandstand. He 
reportedly said: u Sayang angpagpunta natin sa Maynila hung babaliktad 
kayo" (It will be useless for us to go to Manila if we end up joining the 
rebels). He talked about the plans to proceed to Camp Aguinaldo to 
reinforce government forces. 631 Blando still remained in contact with 
Antonio who instructed him to move for Manila right away. 

Blando instructed Trespeces to assemble all the vehicles along the 
road in preparation for loading the troops in the following order: the first 
column of vehicles would be utilized by elements of 71 IB under Maj 
Gutierrez, followed by the command group composed of Blando's close- 
in security, then elements of the 73 IB under.Lt Col Erasmo, and finally, 
elements of the Scout Rangers. The whole group comprising of more 
ftan a thousand men, used two V-150 commandos, 17 M-35 trucks, 13 
Kennedy jeeps, two Land Rovers, one van and two cars. 632 

Blando rode the V-150 going to Manila, leaving behind Trespeces, 
who was designated to be the OIC of Fort Magsaysay with orders to get 
to touch with Blando by radio from time to time. 633 

The convoy, led by Blando, left Fort Magsaysay at 3:30 p.m. 634 He 
raveled from Fort Magsaysay to Cabanatuan, then Gapan and Cabiao, 
ln Nuey a Ecija, then Arayat and San Fernando, in Pampanga, and then 



south through the North Expressway. 636 The convoy passed through the 
PC checkpoints in Nueva Ecya after Col Samonte, CS NOLCOM, at 
around 4:00 p.m., instructed the Nueva Ecija Constabulary Command to 
give Blando's troops safe passage. The convoy was reportedly cleared at 
the Nueva Ecija checkpoints at 6:00 p.m. 636 

Meeting at Malinta, Bulacan 

Blando maintained radio silence duringthe trip from FortMagsaysay. 
The convoy was stopped at Malinta, Valenzuela, Metro Manila, by 
roadblocks placed by government troops and the Bulacan provincial 
government. To check the movement of the group, Col Saturnino Dumlao, 
an emissary from GHQ, met the convoy at about 10:00 p.m. 

Dumlao talked to Blando who was at the middle of the convoy. 
Curious as to what caused the stop, Gutierrez, who was at the front 
column, went to see Blando who was by then meeting with Manayao, 
Avinante and Dumlao. 637 While the officers were conversing, Erasmo, 
who was at the back of the convoy, went forward and joined the group 
which included Valencia and Crucero. 638 

According to Gutierrez, Manayao and Avinante were trying to 
persuade Blando not to go to Camp Aguinaldo, and suggested that they 
go to Fort Bonifacio instead and consolidate there. 639 As reported by 
Erasmo, Blando gave instructions to proceed to Fort Bonifacio saying 
"Let us make that our last stand." 640 Blando, however, denied that he 
wanted to go to Fort Bonifacio. In his testimony, he said that a certain 
"Officer-in-charge of the Rangers who was a Captain" threatened him at 
gunpoint not proceed to Camp Aguinaldo and that they should support 
the rebels. 641 Capt Avinante, the head of the Rangers which joined 
Blando's troops, however, denied that he threatened Blando. 642 

Knowing that the rebels already controlled Fort Bonifacio by that 
time, Gutierrez objected to the instruction and threatened to break away 
from the group and return to Fort Magsaysay. In view of his objection, 
it was decided to proceed to a neutral ground instead. 643 

E.4. 2 December 

The group left Malinta at about 12:00 midnight and proceeded to 
Metro Manila, passing through Balintawak and Munoz Market until it 
reached Ortigas Avenue. It then turned towards the Greenhills area in 
San Juan. The convoy avoided passing through EDSA because of reports 



CHAPTER V 327 



that it was blockaded. They stopped at the area near the Greenhills 
Commercial Complex at about 3:00 a-m. 644 

Tired and hungry, the men and officers of the convoy rested at 
different areas around the parking lot of the Greenhills Commercial 
Complex. Because of Blando's stand to stay neutral, Erasmo had 
discussions with Gutierrez regarding the matter. According to Erasmo, 
they were both by this time harboring doubts as to the loyalty of Blando! 

Erasmo suggested that they call Blando for a "no-holds-barred 
discussion" to which the other officers like Crucero and Valencia agreed. 646 
By 5:00 a.m., Blando agreed and a conference was held, attended by 
Blando, his HQ staffand all officers of 71 IB and 73 IB. Erasmo testified 
that 

... as a result of this discussion seemingly majority of the officers present were 
convinced against the government in order to effect change for the better, finally 
it was decided by BGen Blando to change his stand from being neutral [to 
supporting] the Reform Movement. Then he consulted us if he can already 
declare his stand openly against the government. Maj Gutierrez and myself 
objected by telling him that we will not commit without also consulting the 
consensus of our men and BGen Blando readily acceded . . 

Erasmo explained that, he did not categorically disagree with 
Blando's decision to side with the rebels because of his training in 
"obedience and the custom of the service*. He claimed that his indirect 
hint a was a better way to tell him [Blando] that he [Erasmo] does not 
agree with his [Blando] decision". 647 

E.5. 3 December 

Negotiation at Greenhills 

Prior to this no-holds-barred meeting, Gutierrez on the evening of 
2 December, informed Col Villanueva by telephone that he was in 
Greenhills. After the call, Villanueva talked to MGen Cacanando for 
instructions. Villanueva then proceeded from his quarters in Fort 
Bonifacio to Greenhills. When he arrived at about 5:30 a.m., he sought 
to talk to Blando, but the latter ignored him. Villanueva then spoke to 
Gutierrez and asked to be briefed. The latter related the discussion they 
had earlier. Villanueva, in turn, reiterated to Gutierrez that his stand 
was for the government. 648 

Villanueva reported to Cacanando at around 7:30 a.m. about the 
situation in Greenhills and that Blando was for the rebels. Cacanando 



328 



reacted by appointing Villanueva as OIC of 7 ID, relieving Blando of his 
command. Villanueva talked to Blando, Manayao, and Gutierrez, 
reiterating his position and asking Blando to give up. Blando refused 
to listen. Villanueva then talked to the troops and instructed them to 
follow his orders. He also set up his HQ at the nearby Mandarin Villa 
Restaurant and there reported to PA Operations Officer GHQ about the . 
situation. 649 

Fire fight with the Scout Rangers 

At 8:00 a.m., Capt Avinante briefed his men who were by then 
wearing rebel countersigns about his plan to go to Camp Aguinaldo and 
link up with other rebel troops. 650 They started moving through the 
streets in Greenhills towards Camp Aguinaldo. At 12:30 p.m., loyal 
Marines from 2 MC MBLT 2 under Maj Ducusin backed up by three V- 
150 Commandos arrived to intercept the Scout Rangers. 651 

Fightingbroke out in Connecticut Street, .Greenhills and at the area 
near Belson House, some 300 to 400 meters away from Greenhills 
Shopping Center. The firefights were sporadic. 652 During the shooting, 
Avinante was hit in the leg and was brought to Cardinal Santos Hospital 
for treatment. 653 There were reports that reinforcements from 24 IB, 68 
IB, and 56 IB were expected by the rebel Rangers. When these troops did 
not arrive despite the prodding of BGen Blando, 654 the SRTC surrendered 
and were turned over to BGen Manuel Bruan, CO of the Constabulary 
Highway Patrol Group. 655 

Surrender of Blando 

In the afternoon, Villanueva ordered Gutierrez to arrest Blando. 
Gutierrez asked that he talk to BGen Biazon first before arresting 
Blando. Biazon gave the go signal to Gutierrez. By the time Gutierrez 
was about to arrest Blando, BGen (Ret) Restituto Padilla, de Villa's 
emissary, had persuaded Blando to surrender peacefully. 

Blando was then brought to Villanueva who asked him to stop the 
movement of 24 IB, 56 IB, and the 68 IB. Blando cooperated. He 
contacted Maj Oliveros, who stopped the movement of 68 IB under Col 
Tecson. Blando, however, was not able to contact 56 IB under Zamora. 666 
Blando advised the 7 ID Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations in Fort 
Magsaysay to stop elements of 56 IB from proceeding to Metro Manila, 
and gave further instructions to tell the COs of 24 IB and 68 IB that he 
was revoking his orders to move the troops to Metro Manila. 657 



CHAPTER V 329 



At around midnight, Villanueva brought Blando and Manayao to de 
Villa. Upon instructions of de Villa, Villanueva accompanied the troops 
of 71 IB, 73 IB and HQ personnel to their respective barracks in the 
North. 658 

P. Activities in Northern Luzon 
F.l. Scout Rangers in Isabela 

Defense of the Cagayan Valley Region was undertaken by NOLCOM 
under BGen Orlando Antonio. In December 1989, many Army troops 
were deployed in Cagayan Valley to fight communist insurgency, which 
was prevalent in the area. Hence, part of the PA units present in the area 
were Scout Rangers under the FSRR, which the rebels utilized in the 
December 1989 attempted coup. 

F.l.a. 30 November 

Antonio Orders Red Alert in NOLCOM 

At the 5 ID HQ in Echague, Isabela, a grievance survey was 
reportedly made a week before the coup. Lt Enriquez and Lt Vinuya, 
student officers of the Special Intelligence Training School (SITS), 
ISAFP, arrived with survey questionnaires focusing mainly on issues 
and problems confronting the AFP and the present administration. Part 
HI of the questionnaire tended to suggest courses of action against the 
government such as non-violent civil disobedience or a coup. So-called 
compelling reasons for certain elements in the AFP to resort to a coup 
were presented in the survey. 669 . 

BGen Antonio received an intelligence report about the coup at 1:20 
p.m. on 30 November while on troop inspection in Ilagan, Isabela. He 
then called his Assistant Chief for Intelligence, Col Rubio and instructed 
nun to place all NOLCOM units on red alert. Hence, by 3:00 p.m., red 
alert status was declared in Fort Magsaysay. Troop movements at night 
were disallowed. 600 

Movements of Rebel Rangers in Isabela 

In the morning of 30 November, Lt Col Rafael Galvez, CO 4 SRB, 
Erected Capt Lauro Gordula, EX-0 4 SRB, to take charge, since he was 
6 01 ngto Manila that evening. Galvez also dispatched a group of Scout 
dangers for Fort Bonifacio. 661 This group was later monitored to have 
Passed through Nueva Ecija at 1:30 p.m. 6 * 2 



Before leaving for Manila, Galvez had an occasion to talk to Lt Jose 
Rene Jarque, Operations Officer 4 SRB, who had just arrived at the 
battalion base in Cordon, Isabela from Manila. Lt Jarque testified 

At Cordon, I found out that many of our troops were already gone. They were 
not in their company headquarters as they were supposed to be, and as the 
Operations Officer, it was my duty to find out. So, I had a talk with Lt Col Galvez 
who was then at our Battalion headquarters and he informed me that the troops 
had gone down to Manila. So, I said 'OK sir, what is the plan?' He told me *You 
know', and I said Tea, sir/ But he also told me that 1 am giving you the decision 
whether you should go to Manila or not', and I said, *OK sir, I will think about 
it.' Then, being tired from the travel, it waB almost a 9 or 10 hour travel from 
Manila, I decided to take a rest. At around 8 or 9 in the evening, I was called by 
one of the of the escorts and he told me that Lt Col Galvez was leaving for Manila 
along with some escorts. And, as always, he is a Lt Col and I am only a 
lieutenant. [So] I said *Yes, sir.*" 

Lt Jarque further explained what Galvez meant by "You know* 

Well, there had been discussions before, sir, about that and he told me that they 
(referring to Lt Col Galvez) were going down to Manila, because, I mean, he 
explained it further. I asked, and he said, You know, the same as August 27 and 
28'. So I said, Yes, sir*.*** 

Galvez left Gordon, Isabela for Manila with some companions at about 
6:00 p.m. 665 

F.l.b. 1 December 

At about 4:00 a.m. of 1 December, BGen Antonio left Ilagan, Isabela 
and reached the 5 ID HQ in Camp Melchor de la Cruz, Echague, Isabela 
an hour later. He then instructed BGen Manuel Dizon, CG 5 ID, to 
prepare a minimum of two battalions to augment government forces in 
Manila. 666 At 6:00 a.m., DZRH interviewed Antonio who confirmed the 
ongoing coup d'etat staged by RAM-HF soldiers in Metro Manila. 
Antonio and Dizon announced that they are following the chain of 
command. 

Antonio also directed Dizon to alert the 41 IB and 45 IB with the 
commanding officer of the 503 Bde as Task Force Commander, to 
consolidate forces and to prepare to move on orders to Camp Tito Abat 
in Manaoag, Pangasinan, as NOLCOM reserve for possible deployment 
in Manila. 667 At 7:30 a.m., Maj Mendoza of NOLCOM called for safe 
passage of elements of 41 IB and 45 IB under Col Guillermo from Isabela 
to Camp Abat in Pangasinan. 



CHAPTER V 331 



At 8:40 a.m., Antonio arrived in Camp Aquino in Tarlac and 
immediately called for a conference. He contacted BGen Cesar Nazareno, 
Regional Commander of RECOM 3 who informed him that troops (68 IB 
and 24 IB) in Bataan had already left by then. Antonio also talked with 
BGen Armando Garcia, CG 5th Fighter Wing at Basa Air Base to 
reiterate his position of following the chain of command. 668 

F.I.C. 2 December 

In the morning, Capt Gordula received orders from Lt Col Galvez, 
who was in Fort Bonifacio, to bring the Scout Ranger troops to Manila. 
Gordula assembled about 50 men aboard two 6 x 6 trucks. The 4 SRB 
troops left Isabela and passed through Nueva Vizcaya. The 4 SRB troops 
were stopped, however, by roadblocks at Bgy Malasin, San Jose City in 
Nueva Ecija placed by Capt Undan who was manning the PC checkpoint. 669 

A company of Scout Rangers headed by Capt Danny Panandigan 
belonging to the 2 SR Coy, FSRR stationed in Lallo, Cagayan, also moved 
towards Manila to join the other Scout Rangers in Fort Bonifacio. They 
were able to pass through the checkpoint in San Pablo, Isabela at 11:00 
a.m. by positioning themselves in prone positions aboard dump trucks. 
The movement was immediately reported to 5 ID HQ. Instructions were 
given to the Commander of the 2nd Regional Command Defense Unit (2 
RCDU) to intercept the trucks at Camp Upi in Gamu, Isabela. Before 
reaching Gamu, the rebel Rangers commandeered three aircon buses. 670 

At about 12:00 noon, the three buses were stopped at the check- 
point at Camp Upi. The rebel Rangers alighted with raised arms. Capt 
Panindigan was able to talk with Capt Quilang, the OIC of the checkpoint. 
Shortly after, the rebel Rangers suddenly boarded the three buses and 
sped away going South. 671 

The Rangers led by Panindigan proceeded towards Cauayan, Isabela 
where they stopped to pick up a platoon of about 25 men from the 4 SRB. 
There, they were joined by a group composed of five enlisted personnel 
of the Division Training Unit headed by SSgt Romero and 33 students 
undergoing CAFGU Cadre Training aboard a ten-wheeler truck and a 
Dodge pick-up. 672 

When the group reached Cordon, Isabela by 1:00 p.m., they stopped 
at the 77 IB 5 ID HQ. Some men belonging to the 4 SRB under Lt Col 
Galvez joined Capt Panindigan's men. Lt Jarque, at this time was at 
their Division HQ in Camp Melchor de la Cruz in Echague, Isabela. He 
w ent there to coordinate matters because of reports about the coup in 



332 



Manila. Upon returning to Cordon, he found out that the troops moved 
because of (1) orders given by Capt Lim, Operations Officer FSRR, (2) 
a personal call by Lt Col Galvez, and (3) a radio message purportedly 
coming from MGen Cacanando. 673 

The group of Capt Panindigan was later stopped at a PC checkpoint 
in Brgy Kita-Kita in San Jose City, Nueva Ecija. Capt Undan nego- 
tiated with the Ranger officers but failed to convince them. Undan then 
ordered deployment of his troops as the SR officers were determined to 
break through. 674 

Lt Jarque said that knowing the temperament of the soldiers and 
anticipating the roadblocks set up from Isabela to Manila because of the 
coup, he decided to follow the troops. In his testimony, Jarque said 

... [as the] Operations Officer, knowing that most of the troops went with the 
First Scout Ranger Company, my first instinct was to follow them. I followed 
them with the thinking that there will be roadblocks coming from Isabela going 
to Manila and knowing the temperament of some of our soldiers I wanted 
somehow to avert bloodshed on those checkpoints and at the same time, 
convince them that it's a losing cause and we should already start to go back." 5 

He followed the troops with some escorts aboard two Kennedy jeeps 
and reached them at Brgy Kita-Kita, San Jose City. 

Lt Jarque reached the San Jose PC roadblock composed of ten- 
wheeler trucks, buses and other small vehicles at about 6:00 p.m. There, 
he met Undan, Panandigan, Gordula and two unidentified officers. 
Since it was already getting dark, Undan invited the officers to dinner 
while waiting for the arrival of Col Lagman, PC Provincial Commander. 
They went to a house where they ate and watched television to monitor 
the coup events in Manila. They learned from the TV that Lt Col Galvez 
had already surrendered. In the meantime, Lt Jarque received a radio 
message from Col Matabalao, CS FSRR, or dering them to go back to their 
battalion base in Cordon, Isabela. Jarque approached Gordula and 
Panindigan, who were senior officers, and told them 

Sir, arw kaya kung babalik na lang tayo, wala na rin ito. Saka malabo iiongdito 
tayo makapasok, sir (Sir, why don't we just go back? We are in a very uncertain 
situation, sir). At the same time I also got the radio message at that point in 
time, sir. I used that as an excuse to them by saying, 'Sir, mayroon po tayong 
order galing sa itaas, and so by virtue of chain of command, kailangan sundin 
naUn ito, sir' ,76 (Sir, we have orders from the top. We have to follow them, sir). 



Convinced of the futility of their effort to go to Manila, the 
rebel officers agreed to go back. By 8:00 p.m., Jarque organized the 



CHAPTER V 333 



transportation of the troops back to Isabela. 677 Before the troops could 
leave, Col Lagman arrived and talked to the officers. Gordula informed 
Undan that they were abandoning their plans and would leave for 
Cagayan. 678 

The Scout Rangers left at about 9:00 p.m. and proceeded to their 
respective stations in Gamu, Isabela and Lallo, Cagayan. 679 Col Capulong, 
CO 502 Bde, who was manning a checkpoint in Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya,' 
reported that at about 10:00 p.m., the Scout Rangers were moving back 

North. 680 



F.2. Movement of Lt Col Levy Zamora's Troops 
F.2.a. 3 December 



The 56 IB troops under Lt Col Levy Zamora, CO 56 IB, stationed in 
Imelda Valley, previously moved in the morning of 3 December towards 
Manila on orders of BGen Blando. They reached Arayat, Pampanga, at 
about 5:00 p.m. 

RECOM 3's OPLAN REGAL, which is to check and control troop 
movements in their area of command with roadblocks, was very effective. 
Zamora's troops were checked at Arayat by troops under Lt Col Julius 
Yarcia, CO, Angeles METRO DISCOM. Upon monitoring over the radio 
that 56 IB troops were approaching the boundary of Pampanga and 
Nueva Ecija, and knowing that the 56 IB CO is his PMA classmate, Lt 
Col Efren Fernandez, Pampanga Provincial Commander, called BGen 
Cesar Nazareno, RECOM 3 Commander, and volunteered to confront 
the 56 IB. 681 



Fernandez proceeded to Arayat, specifically to Brgy Camla and 
there met Zamora. The latter was insisting on pushing through, saying 
he was under orders from his "boss", BGen Blando. Fernandez checked 
with RECOM 3 HQ if the 56 IB movement was authorized. RECOM 3 
HQ replied that it was not. 682 

Fernandez tried to dissuade Zamora from proceeding. He told 
Zamora that it was physically impossible for Zamora to move forward 
because "all the people from Arayat to Mexico [Pampanga] have blocked 
already the highways with vehicles, trucks and jeeps." 683 

Once informed of the movements, BGen Nazareno called Col Lagman, 
w ho was still in Brgy Malasin, San Jose City, and told him to confront 
LtCo1 Zamora. Lagman immediately went to Cabiao, Nueva Ecija, and 



arrived there at 5:30 p.m. of 3 December. Lagman narrated the position 
of Lt Col Zamora's troops as follows 



They were strewn [along] the highway, starting about ten kilometers in Gabiao 
[going to] the boundary of Cabiao and Arayat. Then from there, I walked. I 
walked for about four kms and as I faced [them] I was already reconnoitering 
his defensive position of heavy weapons. So, to go there, if I [would] bring my 
troops, for sure we would do battle. So I decided to go there alone so that I 
[would] not provoke the soldiers." 4 

F.2.b. 4 December 

Lagman's estimate of Zamora's strength was about a hundred 
men armed with a recoilless rifle, a mortar, M-16s, and machineguns. 
According to Fernandez, the government side had two battalions, two V- 
150s, two recoilless rifles and a helicopter gunship. 685 

At about early morning, Lagman and Zamora had a dialogue, with 
the former persuading the latter to go back. Zamora, however, said that 
he would go back only if ordered by Blando. Lagman then tried to contact 
Blando through BGen Nazareno. The latter informed Lagman that 
Blando was already in custody. Zamora then decided to give up but 
requested that they wait for dawn, since his troops were scattered on the 
highway. 686 

Troops Escorted Back to Fort Magsaysay 

Before midnight of 3 December, Lagman had requested 7 ID at Fort 
Magsaysay for an officer to join him. Upon orders of BGen Antonio, Col 
Trespeces was sent to Arayat, Pampanga to escort Zamora and the men 
of the 56 IB back to Fort Magsaysay. 687 

Col Villanueva, who was proceeding to Fort Magsaysay with CHPG 
units as escorts, 688 passed through Cabiao, Nueva Ecija from Greenhills 
with troops belonging to the 73 IB and 71 IB. The 56 IB, escorted by 
Trespeces, linked with the troops under Villanueva at about 4:00 a.m. 
and all of them proceeded to Fort Magsaysay. 689 

The combined troops arrived at Fort Magsaysay by morning and 
assembled at the grandstand 690 where they were formally turned over 
to Col Trespeces 691 , while Col Villanueva turned over Zamora to BGen 
Antonio. On orders of Nazareno, Lagman together with Antonio later 
escorted Zamora to Camp Olivas, Pampanga by helicopter. 692 



CHAPTER V 335 



Other Troops Intercepted 

At about 1:30 p.m., personnel manning the checkpoint at Brgy 
Malasin, San Jose City, intercepted four officers and 12 enlisted men of 
the 48 IB with assorted high-powered firearms on board a Kennedy-type 
jeep from Manila. They also intercepted two soldiers belonging to the HQ 
and HQ SGB, 5 ID. 693 

F.3. Aguinaldo's Support for the Rebels 

The then Governor of Cagayan Province, Rodolfo Aguinaldo was 
vocal in his support for the rebels. 

F.3 1 December 

By morning, radio stations aired news about the takeover of Fort 
Bonifacio and VAB by rebels. Aguinaldo, formerly a PC Lt Col, in an 
interview by DZNC-BOMBO radio's Grace Padaca and Bong Roxas, 
expressed his support for the rebel troops, and stated that he would lead 
troops to Manila to augment the rebel forces. 

The airwaves in the Cagayan Valley region became full with counter- 
statements of support for the government. At 7:44 a.m., Col Aguda 
expressed his support for the Constitution and the government over 
DZNC radio in Nueva Vizcaya. At 8:25 a.m., Gov Maning Pimentel of 
Quirino Province, also stated over DZNC, that the situation in his 
province was normal and that he was supporting the Constitution and 
the government. The same broadcast was made by Gov Laurnece of 
Kalinga, Apayao at 8:30 a.m. PC Col Clyde Fernandez of RECOM 2, 
stationed in Ilagan, Isabela, expressed support for the government and 
said that he would prevent Gov Aguinaldo's troops from passing through 
Hagan. 6M 

After his radio announcement, Aguinaldo went to RECOM 2 HQ and 
spoke with BGen Pedro Sistoza, Regional Commander of RECOM 2 at 
8:00 a.m. As reported by BGen Antonio, Aguinaldo urged Sistoza to 
dispatch troops and join the rebel forces but he reportedly refused. 695 
Aguinaldo again went on the air by about 10:30 a.m. through DZNC in 
Tuguegarao, Cagayan, and announced that his troops were already 
Prepared to go to Manila to reinforce the rebels. He urged all soldiers 
listening to support their (rebels) forces. 696 



336 



By noontime, Aguinaldo appealed over DZRH to his "fellow soldiers* 
to join the rebels, referring particularly to the government troops who 
put up blockades to prevent his men from going to Manila. 697 At 5:30 
p.m., Sistoza reported to Antonio that Aguinaldo would probably send 
some members of the 17 IB and some Scout Rangers to augment the rebel 
troops in Manila. Antonio ordered Sistoza to stop Aguinaldo's troops. 
Instructions were also given to Col George Moleta, CO 503 Bde, to 
control 17 IB. Antonio also talked to Aguinaldo at about 6:00 p.m. and 
asked the latter to exercise his leadership to maintain peace and order. 698 

G. Sangley Point Incident 

The military significance of controlling Sangley Point in launching 
a coup attempt is obvious. It is a shared camp housing both the 
Philippine Fleet (PHILFLEET) of the Philippine Navy and the 15th 
Strike Wing (15 SW) of the Philippine Air Force. 

As later events showed, Sangley Point was in fact quickly occupied 
by rebels employing a two-pronged strategy: a swift attack from the 
outside and simultaneous mutiny of some officers and men from within. 
But, just as quickly, Sangley was recovered on the same day by the 
government. 

G.l. Rebel Troops from Bataan 

G.1.«l 30 November 

Because of the ongoing preparations for Exercise Balikatan, raw 
intelligence reports of troop movements received in the morning of 30 
November elicited no more than monitoring measures from the military 
authorities. But, as more definite indications of a forthcoming coup 
attempt were observed, Sangley Point tried by nightfall to prepare for 
the worst. 699 By then, however, the die was cast for Sangley Point. For 
a seemingly long span of time from midnight of 30 November to mid- 
afternoon of 1 December, the fate of the country was to be significantly 
affected by what was to occur at Sangley. 

Sangley was the target of rebel forces coming from Bataan and 
Laguna. 

Movement of Troops from Bataan 

In the evening of 29 November, at Camp Aquino, Tarlac, the 
Commanding General of 702 Bde, BGen Liberato Manuel, received a 



CHAPTER V 337 



report that a coup d'etat would be staged in the early morning of 1 
December 1989. He immediately declared a red alert, informed Gen de 
Villa about the report and subsequently called for a conference of all his 
battalion commanders. 

The conference was held the next day, 30 November at 1:00 p.m. , and 
was attended by Lt Col Arsenio Tecson CO 68 IB, Lt Col Romeo 
Dominguez CO 69 IB, Maj Alfredo Oliveros CO 24 IB, and Maj Rene 
Rapisura, CO 60 IB. In the conference, BGen Manuel informed them of 
intelligence reports of an impending coup and emphasized his support 
for the Republic. After the conference, a despedida party was held for 
Manuel who was about to retire. During the party, Manuel noticed that 
LtCol Tecson was talkingto someone on the radio in his jeep. The person 
on the radio was asking Bakit hanggang ngayon, wala pa kayo sa 
Maynila? (Why are you still not in Manila?) Manuel later learned that 
the person on the other line was BGen Blando. Tecson then informed 
Oliveros that Blando called with instructions to proceed to Sangley 
Point in Cavite. 700 

Tecson went to his base at Hermosa, Bataan at 4:00 p.m. and called 
LtSiegfred Mison CO Alpha Coy 68 IB. Tecson asked Lt Mison if he was 
willing to bring his troop to secure Sangley Point in Cavite. The 
conversation, as told by Lt Mison, was as follows 

Col Tecson told me [Lt Mison] that . . . 'Ako ay nakapag-commit na to . . . dito 
sa gagawin natin na . . . gagawin bukas* (I have committed to what we're 
attempting tomorrow), and then he told me that, 'Can you take your company 
with me to secure Sangley?', and I said, 'Sir, nakabibigla naman iyan (That is 
quite startling), let me think.' . . . And then he said, there's no more time to 
think, wala nang panahon na mag-isip pa (There's no time to think things over). 
So you better decide.' Soltoldhim^sirpassmunaakorito (I can't do it). I cannot 
join you sir.' And then from there, he told me, 'Okay, you just go with Maj 
Dimaapi to go to Samal, and hell take care of you', and that was it. 701 

Tecson instructed Lt Mison to go with Maj Danilo Dimaapi, Battalion 
EX-0, to the Tactical Command Post in Samal, Bataan, located eight to 
nine kilometers away from the highway. It must be noted that the 
company under Lt Mison was not stationed in Samal, but in Orani, 
Bataan. Lt Mison left for Samal immediately and stayed there for three 
days before returning to Orani. 702 

At 8:00 p.m., upon hearing rumors of troop movements in Bataan, 
Blando instructed Col Manayao to inquire on the whereabouts of 24 IB. 
Upon verification with CG 702 Bde, the latter reported that Tecson and 
Oliveros went to Camp Aquino for a conference, and for the despedida in 

honor. 703 



338 



Lt Col Ocampo Meets Lt Col Tecson 

At 9:00 p.m., Manuel went to the HQ of Lt Col Ramsey Ocampo, PC 
Provincial Commander of Bataan, to seek his assistance to stop Tecson 
and his troops from moving to Metro Manila. Together, they went to see 
Tecson between 10:00 and 10:30 p.m. at the Marsteel wharf in Limay, 
Bataan. Ocampo and Tecson are third cousins and are PMA classmates. 704 
Tecson confirmed that he and his troops were going to Sangley 706 for the 
purpose of "securing" it. 706 Ocampo understood this to mean securing 
Sangley "for the rebel forces". 707 Both Ocampo and Manuel failed to 
convince Tecson not to leave Bataan. 708 Tecson told Ocampo that he had 
a "previous commitment" to BGen Zumel and also, that he was "under 
orders". 709 These orders, according to Tecson, came from his "immediate 
Commander" who, Ocampo came to know later, referred to Blando 710 
That was what Tecson told him on 4 December 1989 when Tecson was 
already in military custody at Camp Olivas, Pampanga. 711 When Blando 
testified before the Commission, he denied having ordered Tecson to go 
to Sangley Point. 712 

From Marsteel wharf, Ocampo returned to his camp around or past 
midnight. He reported the matter to Col Agerico Kagaoan, Operations 
Officer RECOM 3 713 for transmission to the Regional Commander of 
RECOM 3. 714 

G.l.b, 1 December 

BGen Manuel — who stayed behind in the Marsteel wharf — 
followed Ocampo to his HQ, Around 1:00 or 2:00 a.m., Manuel talked 
to the Aide-de-camp of Gen de Villa, suggesting that some ships be 
deployed in Manila Bay to stop Tecson's troops. 716 

Even before 30 November, Ocampo had heard reports of a "probable 
destabilization", i.e., that "there was supposed to be a coup in the 
offing" 716 He learned about these in Camp Olivas, during one of their 
conferences with BGen Nazareno. In that conference, Nazareno gave 
"guidance to effectively prepare to defend or reinforce the seat of 
government, just in case there would be a coup." 717 

Tecson and Oliveros travelled from Bataan to Sangley on board what 
was initially known as an unidentified fishing vessel. The indications 
of troop movements in Bataan and the involvement of a civilian fishing 
vessel figured early in raw intelligence reports. However, intelligence 
reports and after-battle reports said nothing definite about this boat and 
it continued to be described as an "unidentified fishing vessel". 



CHAPTER V 339 



G.2. Finding the Pishing Vessel 

The Commission considered the involvement of this vessel significant, 
not only because it ferried two battalions, but also because being a non- 
military craft, its full story could shed light on an aspect of civilian 
resources available to the coup plotters. The Commission, however, had 
difficulty gathering facts as it was "unidentified" in all the after-battle 
reports. It was only towards the close of its investigations that the 
Commission was able to discover that the fishing vessel was actually 
"Lady Vi-T-1", owned by Odessa Fishing and Trading Corporation 
(Odessa) with offices at Navotas, Metro Manila. 

G.2.a. Pre 30 November 

According to Rufino Tiangco, Chairman of the Board of Odessa, 
about a week after 1 November 1989, a person representing himself as 
Artemio Tan of Puerto Princesa, Palawan, went to his office and sought 
to charter a fishing vessel to be used by the middle of November up to 
December 1989 and possibly up to January 1990. Tiangco informed Tan 
regarding the terms and conditions for the charter. Tan left bringing 
with him a sample copy of Odessa's standard charter agreement along 
with other papers pertaining to the vessel. 

Although Tan represented that he was from Puerto Princesa, 
Palawan, the evidence received by the Commission belies it. The 
Election Registrar of Puerto Princesa said that there is no Artemio Tan 
listed as a registered voter in Puerto Princesa. The City Treasurer 
reported that Residence Certificate No. 0828116 allegedly issued in 
1989 to Artemio Tan was not issued in Puerto Princesa and that there 
is no business establishment known as Artemio Tan Trading registered 
in Puerto Princesa. 718 Furthermore, the Station Commander of Puerto 
Princesa wired the Commission to advise that their efforts to locate 
Artemio Tan in Puerto Princesa City and in the Province of Palawan 
were "negative". 719 

Tiangco Charters Out Vessel 

On 10 November 1989, Tan returned to Odessa's office and, on that 
occasion, reached a final agreement with Tiangco for the charter of Lady 
Vi-T-1. Tan and Gabriel Cruz, the President of Odessa, signed the 
charter agreement. Tan then paid Odessa the amount of T 80,000 in 
cash, corresponding to one month's advance rental and one month's 
deposit. Carmelita Villanueva, Odessa's office secretary, confirmed 



340 



having received the payment which she turned over to Tiangco. Receipt 
of the money is not recorded in the books of account of Odessa. 

On 27 November 1989, Tan went back to the Odessa office, 
accompanied by a man he introduced as Rudy Jimenez. Upon Tan's 
request, Tiangco issued a letter authorizing Jimenez to board and take 
over the vessel as Tan's "encargado". That afternoon, Jimenez went to 
the Navotas Fish Port where Lady Vi-T-1 was docked, and presented 
himself, with Tiangco's authorization letter, to the vessel's captain, 
Pepito Dalivenancio. Jimenez was accordingly allowed to board the 
vessel. 

Between 27 and 30 November 1989, two persons on board a service 
jeep arrived at the fish port, bringing with them five cavans of rice and 
three boxes of canned goods which they loaded on the vessel. They were 
allowed to board the vessel, upon Jimenez' instructions. 

G.2.b, 30 November 

At 6:00 a.m., Jimenez ordered Dalivenancio to clear (idispaeha) the 
vessel for Palawan. Before leaving the port, Dalivenancio obtained the 
necessary Coast Guard clearances for the departure to Palawan around 
3:00 p.m. of that day. When the vessel crossed the breakwater of North 
Harbor, Jimenez ordered Dalivenancio to divert the course of the vessel 
and proceed to Bataan instead. Dalivenancio testified that he was 
threatened and intimidated by Jimenez and his two armed companions. 
Dalivenancio accordingly diverted the vessel and proceeded to Bataan, 
reaching Limay past 5:30 p.m. Before arriving in Limay, at a distance 
of about a mile from the shore, Dalivenancio, allegedly upon orders from 
Jimenez, instructed his crew to remove the name of Lady Vi-T-1. This 
was done by prying loose the piece of wood on which the vessel's name 
was inscribed. At this point, Jimenez and his two companions changed 
to fatigue uniforms. 720 

Shortly after arrival in Limay, Lady Vi-T-1 shipsided by a tanker. 
Later on, around 500 uniformed soldiers boarded Lady Vi-T-1 using a 
barge for this purpose. While still in Limay, countersigns (i.e., square 
pieces of white paper, with a figure sketched in the middle) were 
distributed among the soldiers. 721 

G.2.e. 1 December 



From Limay, Lady Vi-T-1 proceeded to Sangley Point at about 8:00 
a.m. Dalivenancio reported that upon their arrival, they were met by a 



CHAPTER V 341 



Coast Guard vessel which escorted his ship into Sangley. Jimenez and 
his two companions disembarked hurriedly and so did the rest of the 
soldiers from Bataan. Dalivenancio and his crew stayed on board the 
vessel. 

G.3. Takeover and Recovery of Sangley - 1 December 

Laguna Troops Move Towards Sangley 

Another rebel force consisting of around 200 men from 16 IB 
stationed at Nagcarlan, Laguna, were motoring to Sangley Point. The 
driver of one of the 6 x 6 trucks carrying the rebels, Sgt Benito 
Cuaresma, claimed that their initial destination was Mauban, Quezon. 
However, enroute, he was ordered to proceed instead to Sangley where 
the troops were to serve as security for Exercise Balikatan. 

The rebel troops from Laguna arrived at Sangley close to midnight 
of 30 November. 722 Again, the rebels used the Balikatan Exercise as a 
ruse and sought entry through the Main Gate by presenting a written 
authorization signed by Cmdr Maligalig. 723 The gate guards refused 
them entry on orders of PHILFLEET Commander Commo Proceso 
Fernandez. The rebels led by ex-Lt Cmdr Jaime Lucas, ex-Capt (PN) 
Felix Turingan and ex-Lt Col Oscar Legaspi PAF disarmed and 
overpowered the guards and let the rest of the rebel troops in. 724 

15th Strike Wing Grounded 

BGen Tereso Isleta, Wing Commander 15 SW returned to Sangley 
at around 11:00 p.m. of 30 November. He met his staff to discuss the 
information he gathered after attending the Command Conference at 
Camp Aguinaldo. Before 1:00 a.m., he ordered his men to evacuate the 
aircrafts to Basa or Clark. The rebels at the gate must have overheard 
his order given through the radio. From the Main Gate, the rebels 
proceeded to take control of the flight line and neutralized the choppers 
and other aircrafts. All the units of the 15 SW — 16th Attack Squadron, 
594th Air Police Squadron, 20th Air Commando Squadron, 590th Air 
Base Group ~ were left intact but effectively neutralized. 726 The pilots 
were taken hostage just before they could takeoff for other bases. 726 

The government pilots were captured by a team led by Lucas. The 
Pilots were detained in the area of the Tora-Toras. One of the raiding 
officers, Lt Pierre Robert Pel, identified one of the hostaged pilots, Lt 
Gregor Mendel Panelo, as a fellow PMA'er. Pel called Lucas' attention 
to Panelo. Turingan came to try to convince the hostaged pilots to join 



342 m 

the rebels. They refused. Turingari and Lucas took Panelo with them. 
Legaspi, in civilian clothes, came to their area and allowed them to use 
the telephone. The hostaged pilots reported their situation to their Wing 
Commander who told them to stay put. 727 

Augmenting the troops that came in the 6x6 military trucks were 
some 80 rebels, who were reported to have arrived at about 2:30 a.m. on 
board a Philtranco Bus with body number 3023. 728 The bus passed 
through the Cavite Gate of the 15SW 729 and unloaded its passengers at 
the supply area 730 near the BOQ. 731 The bulk of the heavily armed troops 
deployed themselves at the Armory No. I. 732 

Mutiny at the Philippine Fleet 

The Philippine Fleet was having its share of problems. Close to 
midnight of 30 November, Commo Fernandez, upon arriving at the 
PHILFLEET HQ from Camp Aguinaldo, called for an officers' conference 
at his office. In attendance were Capt (PN) Francisco Tolin, Commander 
of the Fleet Support Force; Capt (PN) Jose Agudelo, Chief of Staff; 
Commander Naval, Fleet Intelligence Officer; Lt Alfredo Ramos, Special 
Warfare Group Officer of the Day; Lt Manolito Malig-On, Fleet Security 
Officer; Capt (PN) Alex Nebres, Deputy Commander, Fleet Support 
Force; and Cmdr Precioso Filio, CO Headquarters Service Unit. Commo 
Fernandez discussed the matters taken up during the GHQ conference 
and instructed that the Fleet be put in readiness. He directed the 
command duty officer to alert patrol boats PS 29 and 19 for possible 
deployment. 733 > 

While the meeting was in progress, ex-Capt Turingan, Capt (PN) 
Danilo Pizarro and Capt Fermin Cuison entered the office and tried to 
persuade Fernandez to join them. Unable to persuade Fernandez, they 
left. 734 Fernandez did not attempt to apprehend the rebels at this point 
because they were heavily armed. But immediately thereafter, he took 
steps to secure the HQ and relieved Pizarro as commander of the patrol 
force, naming Capt Tolin as acting commander. The other officers at the 
meeting went back to their respective units to prevent them from joining 
the rebels. 

Bataan Rebel Troops Arrive 

The two battalions led by Tecson and Oliveros, on board the Lady Vi- 
T-l, arrived at Sangley mid-morning and disembarked at the Philippine 
Fleet area. 



CHAPTER V 343 



Attempts to Intercept Lady Vi-T-1 

Cmdr Carlos Damian, Commander, Naval Intelligence Security 
Group II, personally received at around 3:00 p.m. of 30 November 
a message from RAdm Carlito Cunanan, Flag-Officer-in-Command, 
Philippine Navy (FOIC), which was transmitted at around 10:30 a.m., to 
verify the reported troop movement by ship from Bataan to Sangley. He 
relayed the message to his Olongapo Office situated inside the Subic 
Naval Base. Nothing was done. It was only on 1 December at around 
2:00 p.m. that Cmdr Damian received word from his San Felipe Fort, 
Cavite City Station that the vessel from Bataan had already landed at 
around 10:30 a.m. in Sangley. 736 

At around 6:30 a.m. Commo Antonio Empedrad, Commander, Naval 
District II, received from PN HQ (HPN) a message assigning to him 
ships/crafts identified as PS 19, LT 502, AU 100, PG 62, and DF 334 for 
the purpose of interdicting rebel vessels going to the North and South 
Harbors, Manila. He directed Capt (PN) Romeo Meana, Commander 
Task Force 21, whose flagship was the auxiliary ship, AU 100, docked 
at Pier 15, to intercept the fishing vessel loaded with rebel troops coming 
from Limay, Bataan. The order was given at 7:00 a.m. , but AU 100 came 
under the operational control of Task Force 21 only at around 7:55 a.m. 

This was followed by another order at around 11:55 a.m. Meana, 
upon receipt of this order from Empedrad, ordered all his ships to 
intercept the vessel. He thought all along that the vessel was bound for 
Manila and they waited for it at the breakwater of Manila Bay. 

A third order was given by Empedrad to Meana at 6:45 p.m., this 
time to intercept the same vessel withdrawing from Sangley to Bataan. 736 
Meana confirmed having received this order of Empedrad at 6:45 p.m. 
He sent out PG 62 and DF 334. The two vessels reached the vicinity of 
Corregidor and Limay, Bataan but reported that there was no sighting 
of the fishing vessel as late as 11:00 p.m. 737 

Commo Fernandez maintained, on the other hand, that his failure 
to prevent the successful landing of the fishing vessel was due in part to 
the directive of HPN on 1 December at around 7:00 a.m., which ordered 
the transfer of some of his vessels to Naval District IL 738 

When the Lady Vi-T-1 docked at the Philippine Fleet Port, it was 
escorted by Navy light craft No. 308. At about 11:40 a.m., the troops 
disembarked and marched towards the Sangley Gate. 739 According to 
Tecson, at 2:00 p.m. he met Turingan who told him to go to Manila and 



attack the Western Police District HQ. Tecson said he was receiving 
orders only from Blando who he tried to contact by radio but failed. 740 
Isleta was allowed to maintain his HQ. He negotiated with Turingan 
and agreed that he would not attack the latter's troops, which were in 
control of the air assets, in exchange for the safety of the WOC and his 
HQ, from where he continued both to monitor the rebel movements as 
well as keep in constant touch with GHQ. Isleta claimed that he called 
for assistance from Capt (PN) Jesus Durian, Naval Base commander, 
who gave him a cold response. 741 Durian denied that Isleta asked for 
assistance. 742 

Commo Fernandez reached a similar stand-off arrangement with 
the rebels led by Capt Pizarro. He was able to retain control of his HQ 
but could not offer any resistance to the rebels. 743 

Rebels Briefly Control the Skies 

The rebels using three Tora-Toras, one Sikorsky helicopter and an 
Islander as a forward air controller attacked Malacanang, PTV-4, 
Crame, and Aguinaldo. The Tora-Toras were piloted by Capt Vergel 
Nacino, Capt Elmer Amon and Lt Joey Sarroza while the Sikorsky was 
flown by Lt Panelo. The Islander was piloted by Lt Orlando Caballegan. 

At Midday The Tide Turns 

Air superiority was regained by the government when Maj Danilo 
Atienza, at the cost of his life, and other pilots of PAFF-5 jets, fromBasa 
Air Base destroyed the rebel air assets. (For details, see Commission 
Interim Report No. 2) 

The end quickly followed. By about noon, the task force earlier 
created by MGen Montano, composed of the PC-INP of Cavite under Lt 
Col Nicetas Katigbak, of Laguna under Lt Col Edgar Aglipay, and 
Batangas under Lt Col Rogelio Regalado, plus other contingents of 
RECOM 4, augmented by two V-150s and charged with the mission of 
recapturing Sangley Point for the government, held a coordinating 
conference to synchronize their movements. 744 But even before they 
arrived at the Sangley Main Gate at about 3:00 p.m., some of the rebels 
had began dispersing from the shipyard area, taking the shoreline route 
towards Varadero and Naval Base Cavite. Many were seen still carrying 
their firearms but others had changed to civilian clothes. 746 A brief 
firefight occurred at about 100 meters away from the Main Gate in front 
of the Combank branch office. Tecson and Oliveros, with their troops, 
were stopped by PC troops and escorted to Lt Col Katigbak who was at 



CHAPTER V 345 



the Main Gate. An agreement was reached for the rebel soldiers to 
return to Bataan and by about 5:30 p.m., they were on board the Lady 
Vi-T- 1 on their way home. Lady Vi-T- 1 could not, however, dock at Limay 
because of the low tide. It docked instead at Mariveles from where the 
troops returned to their respective command posts. Tecson and Oliveros 
proceeded to Camacho, Bataan and surrendered to BGen Manuel. 746 

Capt Pizarro, Capt Cuison, LCdr Fred Tuvilla, LCdr George Uy, Lt 
Michael Angelo Asperin, Lt Vicente Agdamag, LCdr Ruperto Borromeo 
and Ens Gerold Josue surrendered to Commo Fernandez. Later, on 
information given by Capt Pizarro, LCdr Perfecto Pascual, acting 
commanding officer of AD 614, was picked up from his ship. 747 

G.4. Activities of Lady Vi-T-1 Owners 

G.4.el 2 December 

Lady Vi-T-1, now with only Capt Dalivenancio, and his crew on 
board, proceeded to the Navotas Fish Port where it eventually docked, 
reachingthe Navotas port at around 3:45 a.m. Before reaching Navotas, 
a Navy boat approached to a distance of around 100 meters, but did not 
board Lady Vi-T-1, confining itself to focusing its search lights on the 
latter vessel. 748 

At around 10:00 a.m., Dalivenancio went to the Odessa office and 
claimed that he gave a verbal report of the incident to Tiangco and Cruz. 
In the process, the question of whether or not to make a report as 
required by law to the Coast Guard was allegedly discussed. Dalivenancio, 
according to him, was afraid to do so; hence, he requested Tiangco and 
Cruz to make the report to which the two answered "sige" (Okay). Cruz 
instructed Dalivenancio to make a written report which the latter 
completed by the evening of the same day. He then delivered the written 
report to the Odessa office that evening and was received there by Mrs 
Villanueva. 749 

G.4.b. 4 December 

According to Cruz, at past 1:00 p.m., Tiangco and he went to the 
Police station of Navotas to report the alleged hijacking, saying that it 
w as perpetrated by armed persons, but without identifying Tan or 
Jimenez, and also, without furnishing P/Cpl Florencio Castillo, the desk 
officer then on duty, with a copy of Dalivenancio's written report; nor did 
Cruz and Tiangco bring with them Dalivenancio when they went to the 
Police station. Castillo suggested that the matter be reported to the 



Coast Guard and Tiangco said they would take care of it. Castillo said 
that Tiangco and Cruz merely wanted to have the incident recorded but 
not investigated. 750 

The police blotter of the Navotas Police contains the description of 
reports and events which the desk officer enters in chronological order. 
Each entry is given a number. The Commission observed that the 
entries usually contain a detailed description of what happened and the 
full names and addresses of persons included in the entry. The incident 
involving the Lady Vi-T- 1 is unusual in that the entry was at the bottom 
of a page squeezed into only four lines; that its assigned number is the 
same as the next entry; and no address, company name nor ages are 
given for Odessa and either Cruz or Tiangco. 761 

Cruz admitted that neither he, nor Tiangco, nor Odessa, nor 
Dalivenancio made a report to the Coast Guard concerning the incident 
Dalivenancio also said that he did not execute or file a marine protest 
although he knew it was his duty to do so. 762 

Tiangco, in the course of his testimony before the Commission, 
mentioned that he knew Gregorio Honasan, having been introduced to 
the latter by Romeo Rivera. This happened in 1987 during a stag party 
given by Rivera for Don Honasan, who was about to be married. Rivera 
and Tiangco are both members of the Bullseye Gun Club. At the time 
Tiangco joined the club, Rivera was its president. Since that stag party, 
Tiangco claims that he never saw Gregorio Honasan again, although he 
admitted to regularly buying cement from Don Honasan. 763 

EL Malacanang and Sta Mesa Incident 

H.1. 30 November 

Government Troops Prepare for Defense of Malacanang 

In response to reports of rebel troop movement from Bataan to 
Manila received at 9:00 p.m. of 30 November by P/Col Ernesto Diokno, 
then Acting Superintendent of the Western Police District (WPD), 754 the 
entire district, consisting of ten stations and other organic units in the 
General Headquarters, went on full red alert. P/Col Diokno ordered the 
mobilization of all WPD personnel and summoned all field commanders 
to report to HQ for briefing. 755 



Meanwhile, Col Voltaire Gazmin, Commander Presidential Security 
Group (PSG), told the Commission that the PSG is always on red alert 



CHAPTER V 347 



However, because of information regarding a possible coup, Gazmin 
declared Defense Condition three, the highest state of preparedness, at 
6:00 p.m. 

EL2. 1 December 

Bombing of Malacanang 

At about 3:00 a.m., President Aquino convened an emergency Cabinet 
meeting, and after, the meeting, at 3:45 a.m., the President went on 
television to calm the nation. Demonstrating to the televieWers that she 
was "sitting h ere safely at this moment at my office," 156 she informed the 
nation of an ongoing coup attempt and assured the people that "our 
forces have the situation under control.* 757 At about 6:30 a.m., three 
Tora-Toras took off from Sangley and flew towards Malacanang. 758 
Legaspi, reportedly acting as general control, directed the planes to fire 
rockets at Malacanang, Camp Aguinaldo, PTV-4 and Camp Crame. 769 
The planes strafed and bombed Malacanang Complex with machine 
gunfire and small bombs at 6:45 a.m. The bombings were apparently 
intended to kill President Aquino, judging from the fact that what was 
hit was the intended place of safety for President Aquino in case of 
attack. This was known to the rebels because Noble, beingformerly with 
the Presidential Security Group (PSG), had access to their security 
plan for the President. However, unknown to the rebels, Gazmin had 
changed the security arrangements for the President. 760 

Capt Crisanto Reboya, CO of the 1 LACS stationed at Malacanang 
Park, ordered all gunners of the Armor Infantry Fighting Vehicle (AIFV) 
to fire their 25 mm (anti-aircraft) weapons at the attacking rebel planes. 
Some dismounted troops also fired their issued firearms at the Tora- 
Toras, 7 " 

At 7:40 a.m., the President again went on the air to declare "the 
mutiny ... is contained," informing the people that fighter planes from 
Basa Air Base were at that moment attacking the Tora-Toras. She 
warned "never [to] give over this nation to tyranny. 1,762 

Close to noon and after the Tora-Tora attack, US Ambassador 
Nicholas Piatt called up the President and, on instructions ofW ashington, 
expressed American support and willingness to assist the government. 
The President expressed her thanks for the supportive gesture of US 
President Bush and informed Ambassador Piatt that in order to facilitate 
communication, Secretary Ramos would get in touch with him directly. 



Ambassador Piatt took the initiative and, contacted him straight away. 
Ramos, assessing the need of the hour to keep rebel planes away from 
Metro Manila, asked for a "couple of persuasion flights." This, was done 
by US Phantom jets from about 2:00 p.m. to the evening of 1 December. 

Attack of Malacahang from Ground Forces 

Before midnight of 30 November, thirty rebel Scout Rangers were 
sighted on Quezon Bridge and 80 soldiers in civilian attire were reported 
at the foot of Sta. Mesa bridge. 763 

As Malacanang was bombed by rebel planes, rebel soldiers with 
most of them in civilian clothes, and civilians, armed with high caliber 
firearms such as M-16, M203, M60 and anti-tank weapons placed 
roadblocks and checkpoints in various strategic places in Sta Mesa. The 
rebels blocked the approaches leading to Malacanang in order to isolate 
it from friendly government troops coming to its defense. 764 

At one point, these rebel soldiers intercepted at their checkpoint PC 
Lt Wilbur Naldo of the CAPCOM West Sector Command, holding him 
hostage for an hour until he was able to trick his captors by pretending 
to have joined them. He was even introduced to the leader of the rebels 
at the vicinity of Stop and Shop, as Col de la Cruz. 766 

In the aflernoon, Col Gazmin began offensive operations against 
rebel ground forces threatening Malacanang. He designated Maj Agustin 
Dema-ala, CO of HHSB PSG, as Task Group Green Commander to lead 
a company of Scout Rangers under Capt Jessie Dellosa, and a reserve 
platoon under Capt Nestor Castro, augmented by seven AIFV to assault 
the rebel soldiers in Sta Mesa. 766 They were to join the forces of P/Col 
Diokno in fighting the rebels. 

Police and military forces conducted a mopping-up operation along 
Magsaysay Blvd. In the aflernoon, this was augmented by the troops 
under Maj Dema-ala. 767 At about 7:00 p.m., Sta Mesa area was cleared 
of rebel soldiers. 768 The only casualty on the government side was one 
unidentified tank gunner who was wounded during the Sta Mesa 
encounter. 769 

While the fightingto secure Malacanang was going on, the President 
stayed in Malacanang and went on the air confirming the government's 
acceptance of the US offer of assistance, and acknowledging expressions 
of support from friendly governments. She cautioned against compla- 
cency, since the enemy "is routed but he is not yet vanquished." 



CHAPTER V 349 



Mobilization of Police Forces 

By morning, contingents from Chinatown Sub-Station and Police 
Station No. 6 of the WPD were dispatched to the Metropolitan Theater 
to neutralize rebel soldiers atop the Quezon Bridge. Members of the 
City Hall Police Detachment were ordered to establish a roadblock at 
Concepcion-San Marcelino, Arroceros, and P Burgos Sts to defend the 
Manila City Hall from possible enemy attack. 

H.3. 2 December 

Earlier in the afternoon, the operatives of the Operations Bureau 
and Intelligence Division of the WPD, apprehended Clifford Cobsilen 
Yequitan, 27 years old, single and native of Bontoc Province from whose 
possession one Ultimax rifle, cal 5.56 mm with serial number 102260 
and several rounds of ammunitions were recovered. 770 

H. 4. 3 December 

P/Maj Gen Alfredo Lim, WPD Superintendent, arrived in Manila 
via Clark Air Base from an Interpol conference abroad. He immediately 
called for an emergency meeting of all WPD officers and issued orders to 
provide round-the-clock security detail at the Senate, Supreme Court, 
Manila Pavilion, Bay View Hotel and the Manila Hotel, where the Chief 
Justices of Asia and Western Pacific were holding a conference. 

L North and South Harbor Incidents 

The RAM-HF also sought to control the Manila North and South 
harbors as docking facilities for vessels presumably loaded with rebel 

troops. 

I. 1. 30 November 

Recruitment at North and South Harbors 

The coup plotters wanted to win to their side the police forces 
guarding the harbors particularly the North Harbor Police stationed at 
the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) Building. Billy Bibit 771 telephoned 
P/Capt Job Gavino, Station Commander (STACOM), North Harbor Port 
Police at 7:30 a.m. to say that he would send his representatives to see 
him regarding some important matters. At 11:00 a.m. , 20 men in civilian 
clothes, presumably military men, arrived at the North Harbor Police 



350 



Station, on orders of Bibit, looking for Gavino. They tried to convince 
Gavino to join the rebel forces but he allegedly refused. 772 

Calling of Guardian Center Foundation, Inc Members 

At about 7:00 a.m., Elmer Sagsago, 4th Assistant City Prosecutor of 
Baguio City, was informed by his niece, Nena Duba, that an unidentified 
soldier, who showed his Guardian tattoo, came earlier to his residence 
at Naval Base, Baguio City with a message about an emergency meeting 
of the Guardian Center Foundation, Inc (GCFI) to be held that day at 
Pier 8, North Harbor, Manila. Being the President of the GCFI Region 
I Chapter, he felt bound to attend the meeting but decided to verify it 
first. 773 

Eito Ikeuchi, a full time martial arts instructor at the Department 
of Physical Education in PMA since August 1979 and a GCFI member, 
confirmed to Sagsago that there indeed was going to be a general 
meeting of the GCFI at Pier 8, North Harbor, Manila. 774 They agreed to 
go to Manila. They left Baguio at about 9:30 a.m. on board a private 
jeep. 775 

Declaration of Red Alert at Harbor Area 

By late morning, the different military and police units at the Port 
Area started receiving information of a forthcoming coup. The Philippine 
Coast Guard (PCG) Intelligence Unit received reports of the movement 
of armed men from Bataan to Manila on board an unidentified vessel. 778 

P/Capt Gavino declared red alert at 4:00 p.m., although as early as 
7:30 a.m., he was already approached by Bibit to join the rebel forces. 

At about 10:00 p.m., Capt Esmaralda Saplada, Staff Duty Officer of 
the Enforcement and Security Services (ESS), Bureau of Customs, 
received information from Antonio Tigno of the WPD that rebel troops 
known as "RAM boys" coming from Northern Luzon would be passing by 
South Harbor by boat. The information was immediately relayed to the 
Headquarters Philippine Coast Guard (HPCG). 777 

Meeting of the Guardian Center Foundation, Inc 

Sagsago and Ikeuchi arrived at Pier 8, North Harbor, Manila, at 
about 6:30 p.m. They entered a restaurant where they saw Sgts Rodolfo 
Mendez and Rodolfo Ocon and some 15 GCFI member soldiers from the 
PMA in civilian clothes sitting inside the restaurant. Ocon informed 



CHAPTER V 351 



Mendez that there would be a national meeting of the GCFI. 778 Their 
number later increased to about 30. 779 

Sagsago asked Sgts Ocon and Mendez what the meeting was all 
about. He was told by Ocon that they were supposed to wait for other 
GCFI members from Manila. 780 At that time, there were already about 
40 persons in the restaurant, including Sgt Jaime Camacho, Sgt 
Alimbuyao, and other members from the PMA. 781 

That evening, somebody whom Sagsago did not recognize, fetched 
his group and led them to a nearby building which he later on learned 
was the PPA office. There, he saw about 50 people, some in military 
uniform and armed, and others in civilian attire. Sagsago observed that 
not all of those gathered bore the GCFI tattoo. These individuals were 
in a festive mood. Some were saying it was the birthday of someone for 
which a goat was butchered and drinks were served. Sagsago identified 
Cagurangan, a retired soldier who went by the GCFI name of "Founder 
Barorot" and a certain Morit, 782 a businessman who went by the GCFI 
name of "Magic Hermes". 783 

Unidentified persons inside the PPA building told Mendez and other 
GCFI members of the "good news". The unidentified persons declared 
thatthey would change the Government. Concluding that the gathering 
was not really a meeting, Sagsago claimed he called Mendez and Ocon, 
and other members of the Baguio Chapter, and told them he had decided 
to leave the place. 784 

Ocon informed Sagsago that there was going to be a coup and that 
they (GCFI-Baguio Chapter) were being asked to join. Sagsago, Ocon 
and Mendez and Ikeuchi discussed the matter. Sagsago claimed they all 
decided to leave. They passed the word around, among their other 
members, with instructions to leave in groups of two or three so as not 
to attract the attention of the rebel soldiers. 786 

Sagsago and Ikeuchi said they could not take their jeep out of the 
Port Area because by about 11:00 p.m. the gates were already blocked by 
&e rebels. Both went back to the restaurant where they earlier met and 
8 tayed there until the next day leaving the premises only when the 
RAM-HF forces abandoned the harbor areas. 786

L2. 1 December 

Attack at North Harbor /South Harbor Areas 

Bibit's troops started attacking the different units at the Harbors. 
The RAM-HF forces simultaneously took over entry and exit gates of 
South and North Harbors, the HPCG and the Customs Police Station 
located at the PPA building. 

Twenty men in civilian clothes led by TSgt de la Cruz arrived at the 
PPA at 1:00 a.m. and tried to convince Gavino to join the rebel forces. 
Gavino claims he again refused. TSgt de la Cruz requested that they be 
allowed to stay at the North Harbor Area. Gavino relented to this 
request. 787 

As of 2:00 a.m., at the South Harbor Gate 3, soldiers in full battle 
gear, armed with high powered weapons, were already deployed all over 
the area. Their strength was estimated to be around 200 and were 
commanded by Bibit. 788 

Capt Esmeraldo Saplala with several customs policemen proceeded 
to Gate 3 of the South Harbor to alert the guards regarding the arrival 
of rebel soldiers. Upon reaching Gate 3 they saw that Bibit's men had 
taken it over. Bibit asked Saplala to relay his message to the HPCG to 
"lay down their arms and join them on their mission". Saplala contacted 
the HPCG but they refused. Saplala and his men were told to stay at 
Gate 3. 789 



At the PCG Station at the North Harbor (PCGS), a group of more 
than ten armed soldiers in camouflage uniform accompanied by PPA 
policeman Arturo Navarro arrived at 2:10 a.m. One of them, with a 
Philippine Marine insignia, ordered the PCGS personnel to place their 
firearms and ammunitions at the side of the gate. When OIC Jaime 
Daquilanes refused, a certain Capt Tapitan confiscated their arms 
consisting of: three M-16Armalite rifles, four long and short magazines 
and one US caliber .45 pistol with two magazines and 14 rounds of 
ammunition. Tapitan told the PCGS personnel to deposit the firearms 
at Bitot's office in the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Services 
(CIIS). They also tried to convince the personnel to join the rebel forces 
but they allegedly refused. RAM-HF soldiers barricaded the Lauro de 
la Cruz gate with commandeered dump trucks and left. 790 

The RAM-HF group at the Harbor was initially composed of some 60 
fully armed soldiers and six Customs personnel namely: Bibit, Audie 



CHAPTER V 353 



Serrano, Benjamin Cepe of CIIS, Arthur Garcia, Catalino Bondoc of ESS 
and Crisostomo Balneg, storekeeper. This complement later increased 
to about 300. 791 

Takeover of North Harbor 

At about 3:00 a.m., PCGS personnel conducted discreet investigation 
of rebel forces who took control of the Zaragoza and Moriones gates of the 
North Harbor. The rebels were based at PPA Headquarters. 792 

At 3:00 a.m., RAM-HF soldiers took control of the South and North 
Harbors. They raided the ESS Headquarters, disarmed the personnel on 
duty and carted away 16 handguns and eight long firearms of various 
caliber. Using a bolt cutter, they also forced open Security Warehouse 
No. 9 and took 25 cartons of corned beef and several cartons of Marlboro 
cigarettes. They closed down the piers and barricaded Gate Nos. 3,4 and 
6 of the Port of Manila with container vans. 793 

At about 4:00 a.m., Capt Rafael Crisol, North Harbor Section 
Commander, arrived at Gate 1 and found it barricaded by container vans 
and manned by heavily armed men in military uniform, with some in 
civilian clothes, and PPA Police with white headbands. He estimated the 
number of the rebels at 200. 794 

The PCGS at the North Harbor received reports that PPA Police and 
heavily armed men had barricaded the Moriones Gate (Gate 2) and 
Zaragoza Gate (Gate 1) with container vans and cargo trucks. The PPA 
Police and the heavily armed persons prevented the entry and exit of 
vehicles at these gates. 795 

The North Harbor gates were secured apparently in preparation 
for the landing of reinforcements for the rebel forces. Elements of 339 
PC Coy based in Bacolod tried to commandeer a vessel to take them to 
North Harbor. 796 

Many persons, some in civilian clothes, and others in fatigue 
^iforms, but all wearing white headbands, were seen converging at the 
pp A Headquarters which isjust four meters away from the PCGS. PPA 
Policemen allegedly constantly seen with rebel forces were P/Capt Job 
Gavino, Augusto Pilapil, Manuel Coching, Danny Fonbuena, Renato 
Villanub/a, Ernesto Domingo, Matias Tamayo, Jesus Tolosa, Ronnie 
Ahunao, Wilfredo Lira, Francisco Casio, and two persons known only by 
their nicknames Vanguard and Bogard. 797 



RAM-HF Sets Up HQ at PPA Building, North Harbor 



A group of about 30 RAM-HF soldiers went to the PPA Building on 
the night of 30 November. The group increased to about 150 persons by 
4:00 a.m. Some soldiers, armed with Galil, M203 grenade launchers, 
armalites and all kinds of assorted firearms, went to the nearby PCGS. 
The leader who introduced himself as Capt Pilapil, said he was sent by 
Bibit. However, when STACOMoftheCoastGuard,CmdrVelascolater 
talked to Gavino, Velasco said that Pilapil was really ex-Capt Dante 
Pimentel, a GCFI member. 

At about 8:00 a.m., Pimentel asked his brother GCFI, P/Capt 
Gavino, to join them in the fight against the Government In his 
testimony, Gavino admitted joining the GCFI in January 1986. 798 There 
were two media men present at this time. Gavino claimed he refused to 
join their group. 799 Pimentel then asked the number of firearms stored 
in the armory. Gavino informed him that all the firearms had been 
issued to PPA police personnel. Pimentel requested that he and his 
group be allowed to stay at the Headquarters. 800 The RAM-HF soldiers 
roamed around the area and closed the Zaragosa and the Moriones 
Gate. 801 Pimentel ordered some of his personnel to man these gates. 
Then, he proceeded to the PCGS. 802 

Recruitment at the Coast Guard Station 

Pimentel, Sgt Willy Lira and others identified as Bibit's agents, 
entered the PCGS at 9:00 a.m. 803 There, Pimentel tried, without success, 
to convince Velasco, to join the rebel forces. 804 

Meanwhile, Gavino, by telephone, informed his immediate superior, 
Port Manager Atty Salialam, about the presence of almost 300 rebels at 
the area near the PPA Police Station. Atty Salialam gave instruction for 
the men to stay put and to secure the place particularly the Cashier's 
Office and the armory. 805 

Pedro Salazar, Arnold Navarette, and Hilconido Oira, members of 
the Law Enforcement Team, Coast Guard Station, noticed several 
uniformed armed men and civilians with white headbands, together 
with P/Capt Gavino and PPA policemen Ronnie Abundo, Ernesto 
Domingo, Augusto Pilapil, and Renato Villanueva standing, in front of 
the PPA Station. 806 The Coast Guard Station Manila under Velasco 
monitored the actions of Gavino. 807 



CHAPTER V 355 



RAM-HF Soldiers Withdraw from North Harbor 

The RAM-HF soldiers under Pimentel stayed at the North Harbor 
area near the PPA police and PCGS from about 1:00 a.m. until late 
afternoon. At 5:30 p.m., they started to leave the PPA Police station 
bringing with them one shotgun from the station. Atty Salialam 
reported that the reinforcements of the RAM-HF, from the AFP LOGCOM, 
did not arrive. 808 

By early evening, the North harbor had been cleared of about 100 
RAM-HF soldiers. 809 At 8:00 p.m., the remainder of the RAM-HF men 
reportedly left the area. Government troops immediately took over and 
established checkpoints. 

Assessing the Situation at the South Harbor 

Lt Col Virgilio Danao, Acting Chief of the Customs Police, received 
information at about 3:00 a.m. that a coup d'etat was in progress, and 
VAB had been taken by rebel forces. To assess the extent of rebel 
deployment, he checked the NAIADistrict Command under Maj Alpapara, 
who told him that his area was not bothered by the rebels. Danao also 
called POM Command, and was advised by Desk Officer Customs 
Policeman (Cpm) Felix Simangan, that everything was normal and 
quiet in their area of responsibility. 810 

Danao went to South Harbor at 5:45 a.m., and was surprised to see 
the vicinity of ESS HQ surrounded by men in uniform with white arm 
bands and fully armed with high powered weapons. He made rounds in 
the area to assess the situation and found that all his men on duty had 
been overwhelmed by Bibit's soldiers. The rebels were atop the new ESS 
Building with a .50 cal machine gun aimed at the HPCG Building. 811 

During the rounds at the Customs Police Division, the Desk Officer 
reported to Danao that their firearms were confiscated by the rebels led 
by Cpm Arthur Garcia. The office of Lt Antonio de Guzman of Logistics 
was also ransacked and firearms were carted away. Danao tried to get 
in touch with Bibit at 6:30 a.m. but the latter refused to talk to him. 812 

Danao called a staff meeting at about 7:00 a.m. for briefing and 
assessment of the situation. He learned that the entire South Harbor 
was occupied by the rebels led by Bibit as early as 1:30 a.m. and that 
ttost of the zone gates were barricaded. He received a report that Garcia 
j^d other RAM-HF men commandeered the blue pick-up of the Customs 
Police Division. To avoid damage to said vehicle, Danao ordered Cpm 



356 



Lino Bondoc to drive the vehicle and to'keep him (Danao) informed 6n 
activities on the rebel side. 813 

Customs Commissioner Salvador Mison, a retired LtGen and former 
Vice Chief of Staff of the AFP, called up Danao at 7:30 a.m. and asked for 
developments. Danao informed Mison of the loss of ^400,000.00 in cash 
from the Cashier's Office. Mison gave instructions to secure the area to 
prevent looting, pilferage and damage to government properties. Danao 
also received a report that Capt Saplala, his Deputy Staff Officer, was 
being detained and held hostage at Gate 3 by the rebels. He sent Cpm 
Eugenio Monforte to take custody of Saplala from the rebels. 814 

At 10:30 a.m., Danao received a report that the Office of the Customs 
Commissioner at South Harbor was ransacked. When he, Cpm Ely 
Abiog, and Eugenio Monforte went there, they found no sign that the 
office had been ransacked, although there were some tell-tale signs 
of break-in. Danao called up Bibit and together, they conducted an 
inventory. Bibit took two portable transceivers and, after talking 
to Mison over the phone, left a note acknowledging custody of the 
transceivers. 815 

Government Forces Arrive at South Harbor 

At 10:00 p.m., the HPCG received unconfirmed reports from BGen 
(Ret) Benjamin Cruz, ESS Chief, of rebel troops landing at South 
Harbor. 816 , 

L3. 2 December 

At 4:00 a.m., RAM-HF troopers abandoned the ESS HQ compound 
and regrouped at the Commissioner's Office Building. 817 

At noontime, CAPCOM and V/PD elements led by P/Col Diokno 
arrived at the South Harbor with the intention of assaulting rebel 
groups there. Being unfamiliar with the area, Diokno decided to call 
for reinforcements. He then conferred with the HPCG Battle Staff at 
the HPCG regarding the joint operations to be conducted against the 
rebels. 818 

Two patrol cars from the CAPCOM, with sirens blowing, unexpectedly 
entered the Port Area through Gate 1. This prompted the HPCG to 
sound the General Quarters alarm even before the scheduled arrival of 
reinforcements from the WPD. A RAM-HF unit with drew through Gate 



CHAPTER V 357 



6 where they boarded waiting vehicles and trucks parked at the area 
fronting the Lusteveco Office. 819 

Later, Diokno and his group, composed of P/Col Proceso Almando 
P/Lt Col Robert Barbers, P/Capt SA Straebel and other WPD Officers 
and men, in coordination with BGen (Ret) Cruz, drovte away 30 to 40 
soldiers headed by Bibit. The rebels escaped through Gate 6 of South 
Harbor on board different vehicles. A box containing 140 dynamite 
sticks and four vehicles used by the rebels were recovered. 820 

At 1:00 p.m., the expected reinforcement led by BGen (Ret) Cruz 
arrived at the ESS HQ. Majs Generoso Halican, Maglipon, Capt Rolando 
Sacramento, and some policemen of POMDC checked the area and 
confirmed that the area was clear of rebels. 821 

The North and South Harbor areas were clear of RAM-HF forces 
by 2:00 p.m. 822 

J. Other Hostile Events in Luzon 
J.l. Solcom Incident (RSAF 4) 

At around 7:00 p.m. of 30 November, 2Lt Eliseo Rasco, CO, ISAC, 
RSAF 4 stationed at Brgy Sto Cristo, Sariaya, Quezon, together with 
Lts Herminio Cantaco, Jonas Calleja and 47 enlisted personnel, 
commandeered a Philtranco Bus and proceeded to Sangley Point upon 
instructions given to Rasco by an army officer two days earlier. Arriving 
at Sangley at around 6:00 a.m. of 1 December, they beefed up the group 
of Navy Capt Turingan in guarding the gate, port and airstrip. After the 
rebels 1 air assets were destroyed in the afternoon, Rasco and his men 
joined Lt Col Tecson and Maj Oliveros in boarding a fishing vessel, with 
Mariveles, Bataan as destination. 823 

Maj Rosalio Magsino, Battalion Commander of RSAF 4, explained 
that although Rasco's unit was under him, its operational control was 
under Col Miguel Fontanilla, head of Task Force Hunter. Magsino failed 
to arrive at Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig, despite orders from BGen 
jwaristo Carino because along the way he received conflicting orders 
fr om Lt Cols Nicetas Katigbak and Aglipay. 824 

J.2. Legazpi City Incident 

At 9:30 a.m., 1 December, Capt Florencio Flores, CO 3 SRB, with two 
'150s and a whole compliment of 3 SRB occupied Legazpi City Airport. 



358 



Elements of his unit simultaneously took over DZRC radio station and 
PLDT office. Upon receiving a report of Flores* s activities, Col Marino 
Filart, RECOM 5 Commander, constituted a provisional brigade under 
Col Ernesto Maristela to cope with the situation. 826 

At 10:00 a.m., 1 December, Maristela met with Flores, Lts Jay 
Tindoy, Marcel Mercado and Emmanuel Martin to convince them to 
return to barracks. They would not accede because according to Flores: 
"I am here in compliance to a directive from the regimental commander 
of the 1st Scout Ranger Regiment which I belong." However, Maristela 
succeeded in having Flores agree to vacating the premises of DZRC and 
PLDT, consolidating his forces at and confining them to one end of the 
airport. In return, Maristela confined his troops to the other end of the 
airport. 826 

Maristela then ordered his battalion commander, Maj Julius Ovilla, 
CO RSAF 5, to position his men in strategic places and park two dump 
trucks on the runway. As Ovilla was deploying his men, Capt Reynaldo 
Rafal, Deputy Rl, RECOM 5, arrived at 2:00 p.m., with his men and some 
soldiers from 3 SRB on board a 6 x 6 truck driven by Sgt Asistio Cerillo. 
They joined the forces of Flores at the airport. 827 

At 6:00 p.m., 1 December, Col Filart ordered Maristela to disengage 
his troops at the airport. He met with Flores to advice him that he was 
disengaging to avoid a confrontation but he asked Flores to continue 
confining his troops to the airport. 828 

At 6:00 a.m. of 2 December, Maristela, Rafal, Tindoy and Martin met 
at the May on Restaurant inside the airport terminal and again Maristela 
tried to persuade them to vacate the airport for the sake of public 
convenience. The rebel officers left to confer with Flores who arrived 
shortly and told Maristela that he has to consult BGen Blando. When 
Flores returned, he said he was unable to reach Blando. Maristela 
continued his dialogue with Flores because he could sense that Flores 
was starting to weaken. 

At 9:30 a.m., 2 December, Gov Romeo Salalima arrived followed by 
Capt (PN) Rex Robles, both of whom were given permission to talk to 
Flores andhis men. At 10:00 a.m., the rebels received an ultimatum from 
Col Filart. One of the rebel officers asked through Maristela for an hour's 
extension which was granted. Gov Salalima returned with Msgr 
Quiambao and Msgr Sarte of the Legazpi Diocese to intercede with the 
rebels. At the same time, Flores requested a one-on-one meeting with 



CHAPTER V 359 



Maristela which culminated in Flores and his men returning around 
12:30 p.m. to their camp in Villahermosa, Daraga, Albay. 829 

J.3. Sorsogon 

On 1 December at around 6:30 a.m., Col Rene Bautista, Provincial 
Commander of Sorsogon, assembled his men inside Camp Escudero, 
Sorsogon, Sorsogon. During the briefing, Capt Leovic Dioneda, an officer 
previously implicated for leading with Capt Rafal the siege of Legazpi 
Airport during the August 1987 coup, spoke to Col Bautista's men. Capt 
Ruben Iiwanag, OIC, 253rd PC Company, and his EX-O, Lt Gualberto 
Macalos, decided to join the rebel side. They commandeered two 
passenger buses, a Philtranco and a JB Liner. With 100 men, they 
boarded the buses at around 8:30 a.m. bound for Manila. Col Bautista 
did not report the troop movement to RECOM headquarters. 830 

The blocking force of P/Lt Jacinto Sison, Field Force Commander 
stationed at Brgy Binogsocan, Guinobatan, Albay, failed to stop this 
troop movement since they received the order ten minutes after the 
rebels passed by them. At around 11:30 a.m., the two buses were 
intercepted by the blocking force established by Camarines Sur 
Constabulary Command in Camarines Sur, however, the rebels were 
able to proceed as planned. The Provincial Commander of Camarines 
Sur tried but failed to convince the rebels to turn back. 831 However, in 
Camarines Norte, the Provincial Commander, after seven hours of 
negotiation, successfully convinced the rebels to return to Camp Escudero 
which they reached before midnight. 832 

In the late evening of 2 December, Capts Liwanag, Dioneda and Lt 
Macalos organized a second troop movement this time originating from 
Villahermosa, Daraga, Albay where the 3 SRB is based. It fizzled out 
because the rebel Rangers would no longer follow. 833 

When asked while testifying before the Commission if he had heard 
that Capt Dioneda had the reputation of being something of a Robin 
Hood, BGen Filart (who was promoted to BGen sometime after December 
W89) replied 

Yes sir, as a matter of fact, . . . that was one of the reasons why he [Dioneda] 
should be transferred out of the region because he or his family was operating 
a jueteng operation in Sorsogon.*" 



360 



Filart also added 

. . . during my interview with Capt Liwanag about any money involved, he told 
me, according to Capt Dioneda, he [Dioneda] was given P500,000 to support the 
Bicol operation ... to defray expenses for the movement.** 1 



EL Mactan Incident 

Historic Mactan Island, site of the alternate international airport 
and Mactan Air Base (MAB), was in the public eye for a period of nine 
days during the December 1989 attempted coup d'etat, as rebel forces led 
byBGen Jose Comendador, Commanding General 2nd Air Division (CG 
2 AD) took control of MAB and the airport, including aircrafts belonging 
to the Philippine Air Lines (PAL). 

Of specific interest were the PAF air assets, particularly the F-5 jets 
and the Sikorsky helicopter gunships, which could provide ample air 
support to whomsoever controlled MAB. There were 27 PAF aircrafts at 
MAB at the time: four F5s, three C130s, one T-28, one T-33, seven 
Nomads, two S-76s (Sikorsky), and nine Hueys. The C 130s and the 
Hueys are capable of moving troops. There were also 13 commercial 
aircrafts at the Mactan alternate international airport; two 747s (which 
were diverted to Cebu since NAIA was closed to air traffic), two BAC- 
111s, six Sunrisers, two Fokkers, and one LBC AVRO. Apparently, the 
intended use of the base, the airport, and the PAF and PAL air assets 
would have provided a convenient means of moving combat troops to 
Luzon from Visayas and Mindanao and vice versa. 836 

K.1. 30 November 

BGen Comendador Briefs his Men 

At about 8:00 p.m., red alert was declared at the MAB. Thirty 
minutes later, Comendador talked to his personnel at the 2 AD and told 
them "You have got to put your trust in me, get orders from me, and 
follow the chain of command." At that particular time, 2 AD personnel 
thought that BGen Comendador was still their legitimate commander 
and was receiving orders from BGen Renato Palma, COMVISCOM. 837 

Meanwhile, at 11:00 p.m., of the same evening, some elements of the 
23 IB 4 ID in Bayugan, Agusan del Sur were told by Lt Gerry Amante 
that they would go to Nasipit, Butuan City for a security mission. 538 Cpl 
Elmer Barrientos drove Lt Col Ericson Aurelio, CO 23 IB, in his service 



CHAPTER V 361 



jeep for Nasipit, followed by two 6 x 6 trucks loaded with soldiers and one 
V-150. At Nasipit, Barrientos was informed that they were going to 
secure MAB.* 39 ~ ° 

At about the same time, Lt Pedro Sumayo informed his men, a 
segment of 23 IB personnel at their Headquarters in Bidcor Compound, 
Bayugan, Agusan del Sur, that they would be proceeding to MAB to 
secure government facilities there. After the briefing, they were issued 
firearms, given a basic load of ammunitions, and proceeded to Nasipit 
wharf, where they boarded the M/V Our Lady of Lourdes and sailed for 
Mactan. Aside from Lt Sumayo, the officers included Aurelio, Amante 
and 2Lt Ramos. 840 At about 11:00 p.m., members of the Alpha Coy, 30 
IB 4 ID, based in Bad-as (Placer) Surigao del Norte, were told by Lt 
Ricardo Nepomuceno that they will proceed to Mactan to secure the air 
base. Forty three enlisted personnel boarded a 6x6 truck. Nepomuceno 
with his escort boarded a mini cruiser and all of them, together with a V- 
150 commando vehicle, left their Command Post and proceeded to 
Surigao pier where they boarded M/V Sweet Pearl and left for Mactan. 841 

K.2. 1 December 



Upon BGen Comendador's instructions, Lt Rodolfo de la Torre, 
Junior Aide-de-camp of Comendador and Intelligence Officer of 2 AD, 
with about 20 enlisted personnel, manned a checkpoint at the foot of the 
Mactan bridge (Lapu-Lapu side) at about 2:00 a.m. to prevent any Cebu 
City troops from reaching Mactan. 842 

Troop Movements Toward Cebu 

VISCOM headquarters received information of unauthorized troop 
movements of the 23 IB and 30 IB, which were on their way to the Cebu 
Headquarters, 4 ID and Headquarters PC/INP RECOM 7. They learned 
that 23 IB was headed by Aurelio, while 30 IB elements, identified as A 
^oy was headed by Nepomuceno. Their combined strength was esti- 
mated at 550-600 soldiers, with two V-150s, 90 mm recoilless rifles and 
81mm mortars. 843 

With the confirmation that the Mindanao troops were in fact bound 
for Cebu, BGen Palma contacted Naval District V Headquarters and 
jnstructed them to intercept the two vessels by all means. BGen 
Umendador was also called upon to help the Navy in preventing the 
«»P8 from docking and to coordinate directly with Capt Vicente Escala, 
J r, of Naval District V. 844 



362 



Request for PAF F-5 Planes 

At around 7 :00 a.m. , Col Filamer Art^jo, EX-0 for Operations, talked 
to Lt Col Romeo Lood, Director for Operations of 2 AD, to release four F- 
5 aircrafts for Basa Air Base. 845 Not getting any result, MGen Jose de 
Leon, Jr, CG PAF, personally called and ordered Comendador to give 
clearance for the four F-5 jets to take off from MAB. The latter answered 
in the affirmative but did not comply with the instruction. 846 

At around 9100 a.m., Col Artajo again called Lood to follow the direct 
order of de Leon to Comendador for the release of the four F-5 jets, but 
was informed that Comendador had countermanded the order. 847 

Interception of Ml V Sweet Pearl 

POl Restituto Baring, Captain of Naval Gunboat DF 338, received 
instructions at around 9:00 a.m., from his Operations Officer, Lt 
Jimenez, to intercept M/V Sweet Pearl. The vessel was seen inside Cebu 
Harbor and was contacted by radio to drop anchor. Instead, M/V Sweet 
Pearl maneuvered and headed for the General Milling Corporation 
(GMC) wharf. From the Operations Center, DF 338 fired warningshots 
but M/V Sweet Pearl nevertheless proceeded. DF 338 was then instructed 
to fire directly at the propeller of the vessel to disable the same, but due 
to the presence of civilian passengers on board M/V Sweet Pearl, DF 338 
just fired another warning shot. Upon seeing a bazooka aimed at its 
direction, DF 338 moved to a safer distance, but continued to guard the 
ship. 848 

M/V Sweet Pearl was able to dock at the GMC wharf at around 9:10 
a.m. M/V Our Lady of Lourdes followed suit at past 10:00 a.m. that 
morning by shipsiding with M/V Weasel, a vessel owned by Load Star 
Shipping which was discharging bulk grain white corn. When soldiers 
in full battle gear started disembarking, Security Guard Norvie Craus 
observed that the soldiers had no name patches, while guard Ceferino 
Lopez testified that PAF soldiers led by ex-Lt Col Ebuen with 6 x 6 trucks 
from the PAF, with plate numbers SAG 961, SCV 676, SCV 677, SBY 
93 1, BB Y 843, SBY 483 and a civilian truck with plate number CAW436, 
fetched the soldiers at around 1:30 p.m. that day, and brought them 
inside MAB near the office of 2 AD. 

Some soldiers immediately proceeded to the ramp where the air 
assets were. Other soldiers were left on board M/V Sweet Pearl and 
M/V Our Lady of Lourdes to guard the heavy armaments and vehicles

which could not be unloaded from the vessels because of low tide. They 
were finally unloaded the following day, 2 December.® 49 

Comendador Instructs Pilots Not to Fly 

Before the arrival of the vessel in the morning, BGen Comendador 
held a conference with some 25 pilots, instructing them to follow the 
chain of command, not to go near the aircrafts, and not to take off without 
his prior clearance. 860 

Lt Col Fusilero was at the headquarters of the 348 PC Coy located 
at the foot of the Mactan bridge (Mandaue City side) at about 8:00 a.m. 
carrying ahand-held radio. While there, Fusilero informed Mfy Rolando 
Irizari of the arrival of the troops from Mindanao on board two commercial 
vessels, and gave instructions for Irizarfs troops to be on standby 
position. Irizari then proceeded to the METRODISCOM Headquarters 
where an updated briefing on the coup was held. Irizari informed Col 
Waning, the Acting METRODISCOM Commander and Maj Ernesto 
Padua, METRODISCOM Intelligence Officer, of the presence of Fusilero 
at the 348 PC Coy. 861 

e At about the same time that Fusilero was at the 348 PC Coy HQ, 
Ebuen, together with Maj Ricardo Muiya, PAF, were at the middle of the 
Mactan bridge monitoring the arrival of the two vessels from Mindanao 
through their hand-held radios. Airmen Dominino Recla and Efren 
Tabanas testified that Fusilero was seen inside MAB in the morning of 
30 November 1989. Ebuen was also seen with Comendador and Col 
Pablo Regullano at about 5:00 p.m. of the same date, near the office of the 
2 AD. 862 

After BGen Comendador's meeting with the pilots at around 8:00 
a.m., he ordered Lt Col Antonio Anciano, PAF, Commander of the 
Mactan-based 208 Tactical Helicopter Squadron of the 205 HW (under 
the over-all command of BGen Loven Abadia), to report to him. BGen 
Comendador asked Lt Col Anciano if they can possibly work together, 
apparently as a way of gauging the latter's loyalty. 863 

During all this time, Palma was trying to contact Comendador 
without success. He was informed that Comendador was at the ramp. 864 
This was only a ploy as MAB was already preparing for the arrival of 
troops from Mindanao. 

At about 11:15 a.m., Mai Almario Hilario, Lt Col Anciano's PMA 
classmate and Intelligence Officer of VISCOM, called up the latter and 



364 



asked him (Anciano) to remind Comendador to call up VISCOM 
Headquarters. Comendador told Anciano that he would call VISCOM, 
particularly Palma in due time. By this time, Anciano doubted 
Comendador's loyalty. 865 

In the afternoon, Ebuen suggested that C130 pilots be located for the 
purpose of ferrying the Mindanao troops to Manila. Lt Col Romeo Lood, 
Operations Director of the 2 AD was informed by the Wing Operations 
Center of 220 Airlift Wing that there were no available pilots. The 
alternative plan, to utilize the PAL BAC-111 aircraft for the same 
purpose, met the same fate — no PAL pilot could be found. It was clear 
at this point that the troops from Mindanao had nowhere to go. At 
sundown, Aurelio wanted the aircrafts at the ramp crippled or destroyed, 
as they had become useless inasmuch as there were no pilots to fly them. 
Besides, it was so cumbersome for the troops to guard the aircrafts, and 
they might as well concentrate on guarding the Mactan Bridge. Lood 
was able to convince Comendador that destroying the aircrafts wouldbe 
senseless. Heeding Lood's advise, Comendador instead ordered the 
removal of the batteries and starting units of the aircrafts. 866 

Meanwhile, Fusilero was again seen in the afternoon at the 
Headquarters of the 348 PC Coy. This time, there was merrimentand 
clapping among PC soldiers and some Navy personnel, while the 
Philippine flag at the headquarters flagpole hung inverted, i.e., red side 
up and blue side down, a sign of a declaration of war. 867 It took an order 
coming from the RECOM 7 Chief of Staff, Col Superable, tohave thfe 
flag returned to its normal position. 858 It would appear that the soldiers 
at the 348 PC Coy had been misled by Fusilero that the chain of command 
of RECOM 7 had sided with the rebels. Seen in the company pf Fusilero 
were LCdrDanilo Abinoja, LtSGNapoleon Estilles, LtReynaldo Esquerra, 
and LUG Leodegardo Acebedo of the Coast Guard, PN. 869 

Inversion of the Philippine Flag 

At this juncture, it is worth mentioning that Irizari, during the 
August 28, 1987 coup attempt, had also allowed the inversion of the flag 
in his Headquarters in Siquijor for which offense he was found guilty 
reprimanded, and his salary for one month forfeited. 860 

In the afternoon, Comendador was ssen fuming mad, after having 
monitored through commercial radio that Phantom jets of the US Air 
Force flew persuasion flights in Metro Manila. Around this time, 
Comendador openly admitted to all and sundry, including the media, 
BGen Imperial and BGen Palma that he was supporting the rebels. 861 



CHAPTER V 365 



IL3. 2 December 

In the early morning, Lts Sumayo and Amanteled teams of the 23 
IB from MAB to the foot of the Mactan-Mandaue bridge instructing them 
to check movements of vehicles and people coming in and out of Mactan 
Island. 862 

Inside MAB that morning, Anciano, clad only in shorts and T-shirt, 
jogged around the base, slipped out surreptitiously and went to VISCOM 
Headquarters. Anciano briefed Palma on what transpired inside the 
base and assured him that not one ofhis pilots would fly for Comendador. 
Anciano later returned to the pilot's quarters at MAB with Palma's 
instructions for the pilots to immediately leave the base. The pilots left 
on board a convoy of an ambulance, a private car, and a tricycle and 
proceeded directly to VISCOM HQ. 863 

At about 2:00 p.m., Cerge Remonde, Radio Station DYLAbroadcaster 
and Cebu City newspaperman, received a telephone call from former PC 
RECOM 7 Commander BGen Abenina requesting that he be allowed 
to air a statement over the radio station. Abenina went on the air 
expressing support for the RAM-HF. 864 

Negotiations with BGen Palma 

Negotiations between COMVISCOM and BGen Comendador began 
at about 8:00 p.m. Comendador told Palma that he would surrender only 
when rebel forces in Manila gave up the struggle. At that time also, the 
Mindanao Independence Movement, ledby former Assemblyman Reuben 
Canoy, expressed firm support for the rebels' cause and distributed anti- 
government materials in Cebu City. 866 

Later that evening, Gen de Villa ordered Palma to take Mactan. 
However, VISCOM at that time was seriously handicapped by lack of 
manpower and firepower as they had but one company of infantry from 
the 57 IB, based in Negros Oriental, which only arrived earlier in the 
morning. 866 

K»4. 3 December 

BGen Cesar Go, Wing Commander of the 220 Airlift Wing based in 
Mactan, who was in Manila when the coup started, was designated by 
MGen de Leon as Acting Commander, 2 AD, vice Comendador, because 
the latter had publicly announced his support for the rebel forces. Upon 
his designation, Go proceeded to Cebu using the old Lahug Airport and, 



366 



upon arrival immediately proceeded to VISCOM HQ and reported to 
Palma. Although Go had at first intended to proceed to MAB, he was 
prevailed upon by Palma not to do bo, since he might be taken hostage 
by the rebels. 

.t 

While at VISCOM headquarters, Go contacted Comendador and 
attempted to convince him to give up in order to avoid a bloody confronta- 
tion. Comendador refused, and advised Go not to enter MAB nor initiate 
an air assault upon his forces; otherwise, he (Comendador) would blow 
up all the aircraft in the base. Comendador also told Go that despite the 
lack of pilots to fly the aircraft in MAB, they could still avail of it for 
strategic purposes. In another talk with Comendador, the latter told Go 
that he would submit himself to Palma, once the rebel forces in the 
Manila area had surrendered. Even after the surrender of rebel troops 
in Makati's Commercial District, however, Comendador still clung to the 
belief that this was only a ruse played by government forces on him. 867 

IL5. 4 December 

Comendador Establishes Command Post 

In the early morning, Comendador left MAB and established a 
command post at Heidelberg Restaurant situated at the foot of the 
Mactan -Mandaue Bridge, Lapulapu City side. 868 Comendador had no 
more troops to command as most 2 AD personnel had deserted him and 
had reported to the newly-installed 2 AD Commander, BGen Go. The 
rebels, therefore, had to consolidate their forces at the foot of the bridge 
because of continuing threats of invasion from the government forces 
coming from the other end of the bridge. 

At 6:30 a.m., combined elements of R2 Division, RECOM 7, NISC 
and NDV took into custody former Assemblyman Canoy. After due 
investigation, Canoy was charged with the crime of rebellion before the 
local RTC. Earlier, Canoy was seen conferring with Comendador and 
other rebel soldiers at the former's office at 2 AD. 869 

F 

Armed with the necessary clearance from COMVISCOM and RECOM 
7 Commander, Mayor Alfredo Ouano of Mandaue City, Vice Mayor 
Paterno Canete, Acting Mayor Camilo Eyas of Lapulapu City, ABC 
President Paulino Dy and Councilor Manuel Masangkay spoke to 
Comendador inside MAB at about 6:00 p.m. about the latter surrendering 
peacefully. Comendador assured the group he would not fire the first 
shot but he would not surrender. He complained that the country was 
"prostituted" whenhelp was soughtfrom the US Air Force in fightingthe 



CHAPTER V 367 



rebels, addingthat the people surroundingthe President were communist- 
leaning and should be dismissed. He also stated that the present 
leadership was not sincere with the armed forces and that he wants a 
snap election. 870 

K.6. 5 December 

At 3:00 p.m., Palma informed de Villa, that the ultimatum given for 
the surrender of rebel forces in Mactan Island had lapsed and that he 
was preparing for a military offensive against the rebels. This time, 
augmentation troops from nearby islands had arrived, enhancing the 
capability of VISCOM to retake Mactan. 871 

Efforts by Mediators 

Earlier efforts made by Cardinal Vidal, Msgr Achilles Dakay, and 
some public officials for the surrender of Comendador proved futile. 
Authorities consequently got in touch with relatives of Comendador as 
a last ditch effort to persuade the latter to give up peacefully. At around 
5:00 p.m., Cardinal Vidal and Msgr Dakay, this time in the company of 
Ruth Comendador, daughter Pinky and son Dexter, himself an air force 
pilot with the rank of captain, in a tearful reunion at Heidelberg 
Restaurant tried to convince Comendador to surrender, but without 
success. 872 

K.7. 7 December 

After his arrival from Hongkong, Cebu Governor Emilio Osmena 
joined Cardinal Vidal, Msgr Dakay and Ernest Weigel in a series of talks 
with Comendador that started about 2:20 p.m. of 7 December at the 
Heidelberg Hotel. As the discussion progressed, Comendador made 
clear his refusal to recognize the Constitution. Hence, the negotiators 
feltthat there was no point in further talks. Besides, Comendador asked, 
as a pre-condition for his surrender, the resignations of President 
Aquino and the entire Cabinet. Given such demands, the negotiators 
informed President Aquino and Palma that the negotiations had bogged 
down. 873 

K.8. 8 December 

At about 8:00 p.m., Comendador and his seven close-in security men 
left Heidelberg Hotel and checked-in at the Traveller's Inn, Reclamation 
Area, Cebu City. 



368 



K9. 9 December 

In the early morning of 9 December Comendador, with Sgt Ureal 
left Traveller's Inn for an undisclosed place. 874 At 10:35 a.m., Palma 
announced that rebel soldiers were willing to give up and return to their 
barracks. It was about this time also that de Villa instructed Palma to 
proceed to Mactan and accept the surrender. 

Fusilero relayed certain conditions for their meeting at the Mactan 
Bridge. There were to be no troop movement at the bridge, no one should 
carry long arms, each party to be made up of only nine persons should 
meet each other at the middle of the bridge for final negotiations, and the 
time of the meeting to be at 1:30 p.m. 876 

At 12:01 p.m. of 9 December, negotiations between the government 
side led by Palma and Imperial and the rebel side led by Fusilero, Aurelio 
and Nepomuceno began. The government guidelines for the surrender 
issued by de Villa were: "for the rebel forces to subject themselves to 
military control of their respective commanders, to turn in their firearms, 
to return to barracks; and to meet the consequences of their actions/' 876 

Negotiations at the bridge were concluded at 2:00 p.m. Comendador 
submitted himself to Palma and was placed under the custody of Go, 
while Fusilero was placed under the custody of Imperial. All others were 
brought to VISCOM HQ. Army soldiers boarded M/V Our Lady of 
Lourdes bound for Cagayan de Oro City with their two V- 150s and APG, 
accompanied by Congressman Vicente de la Cerna of Cebu. Ebuen 
eluded the military cordon around Mactan Island and continues to be 
at large. 877 

K.10. 10 December 

Surrender of Comendador 

At around 12:40 a.m. of 10 December, M/V Our Lady of Lourdes left 
Cebu for Cagayan de Oro with five officers, 114 enlisted personnel, two 
V- 150s, two 6x6 trucks and jeeps 878 

The following day, at 12:18 p.m., Comendador and Fusilero were 
brought to Manila aboard Fokker plane NR 210 879 and thus ended the 
saga of Mactan Air Base.

L Hostile acts in the province 
L.1. Bacolod (NICOM) Incident 

On 1 December at around 2:00 a.m., a group of 50 fully armed 
soldiers under Capt Leonardo Villanueva, Company Commander of the 
339th PC Company, stationed at Victorias, Negros Occidental and later 
joined by MSgt Felizardo Espinosa, Patrol Base Commander of the 33 1st 
PC Company, assigned in Brgy Granada, Bacolod City and Lt Emil Ong, 
PA Team Leader of the 7 Riverine Assault Company 3rd Special Forces 
Battalion, and four of his men, occupied the Bacolod Airport. 880 Their 
presence there, together with some civilians, was confirmed from footages 
taken by the crew of the local station, Channel 4 of ABS CBN. 881 

Apparently, the rebels went to the airport to wait for a plane 
expected to come from MAB, to ferry them to Manila. With the 
development in Mactan, the rebels decided to secure other means of 
transportation. At around 2:00 p.m., 103 rebels proceeded to Banago 
wharf to board a vessel there. Lt Col Miguel Coronel, Negros Occidental 
Provincial Commander, prevented the sailing of a ship by not making 
the master and crew available and at the same time feigning that certain 
parts of the ship were malfunctioning. At 5:00 p.m., after negotiations, 
the rebels capitulated. 882 

At around 10:00 a.m., two platoons of the 11 IB under Lt Fidelino 
Agustin were sent to Pulupandan, Negros Occidental, where a port of 
entry is situated. They were later augmented by two more platoons 
underCapt AugustoGo. At around 11:00 a.m., Lt Ong and his men tried 
but failed to persuade Lt Agustin to side with them. 883 

To secure the V-150 of the 332nd PC Company under the command 
of Capt Rolando Lopez, Coronel had it parked at the police station in 
Bago City on 1 December between 1:00 and 2:00 p.m. 884 

LA Fernan do Air Base 

At about 8:30 in the morning of 1 December 1989, Col Hector M. 
Tarrazona called a meeting of 26 officers stationed at the Fernando Air 
Base. Those who attended included the Wing Chaplain, the Legal 
Pfficer, the Medical Officer, the members of the Wing staff and some 
junior officers. The purpose of the meeting was to sound out their 
concern about the ongoing coup attempt 886 In the course of the meeting, 
Col Tarrazona stepped out and, by phone, informed the Wing Commander 
that some junior officers wanted to fly two of the Marquitte aircrafts in

LA Fernando Air Base 

At about 8:30 in the morning of 1 December 1989, Col Hector M. 
Tarrazona called a meeting of 26 officers stationed at the Fernando Air 
Base. Those who attended included the Wing Chaplain, the Legal 
Officer, the Medical Officer, the members of the Wing staff and some 
junior officers. The purpose of the meeting was to sound out their 
concern about the ongoing coup attempt. 886 In the course of the meeting, 
Col Tarrazona stepped out and, by phone, informed the Wing Commander 
that some junior officers wanted to fly two of the Marquitte aircrafts in 



370 



the Base as a show of support for the rebels. The Marquitte aircraft is 
essentially a training plane and is not armed. The Wing Commander, 
Col Felipe Abando, Jr, instructed Col Tarrazona to dissuade the officers 
from carrying out their plan, and instead, follow the chain of command. 8 " 

As Col Tarrazona proceeded to try and change the minds of the junior 
officers sympathetic to the rebels, Col Abando directly contacted the 
maintenance officers of the 443 Field Depot and Maintenance Squadron 
to place all the aircrafts inside the hangar and remove from the planes 
all batteries and parts needed to make them operational, keep the planes 
in a secured place, and otherwise prevent the planes at all costs from 
flying. 887 

After about an hour and a half of an open and candid discussion, to 
which Col Tarrazona promised confidentiality, the meeting was adjourned 
with the group deciding to stay loyal to the government. During that 
meeting, only five junior officers were very vocal and sympathetic to the 
rebels, although Col Tarrazona observed, "if we go by head count, most 
of the pilots were sympathetic to [the] rebels". 888 Nevertheless, after the 
meeting, these same five outspoken officers assisted in strengthening 
the security of the base. 889 

L.3. Davao Incident 

On 30 November at around 9:30 p.m., BGen Mariano Baccay,Jr, PC 
INP Region XI Commander, convened and directed his commanders 
to uphold the Constitution and follow the chain of command. It was 
gathered from Col Franco Calida of the Davao METRO DISCOM that 
some junior officers were conducting clandestine meetings in Davao City 
and that one of these officers was 2Lt Cesar Mancao III assigned to PC 
CIS, District XI. Baccay ordered Mancao to cease and desist from trying 
to recruit PC/INP junior officers for the rebel cause. 880 

On 1 December at around 8:00 a.m., Baccay assembled his men and 
reiterated the need to follow the chain of command. At around 11:40 
a.m., he received information that elements of the 25 IB stationed in 
Pintatagan, Banaybanay, Davao Oriental were about to commandeer 
passenger buses to go to Davao City, and from there on to Manila. 
However, the soldiers abandoned their plan after their commander 
talked to them. 891 

On 2 December at around 5:00 p.m., a group of company grade 
officers numbering about 25, accompanied by Lt Col Teodorico Viduya, 
Provincial Commander Davao del Norte, went to Baccay at Camp 



CHAPTER V 371 



Panacan in Catitipan, Davao City, to seek guidance regarding the 
ongoing coup and other issues such as violence and US intervention. 
For two and a half hours, Baccay emphasized the theme that an abrupt 
change in the government was not the cure to the present problems. 
Apparently, the officers were convinced so they promised to adhere to the 
Constitution, observe the chain of command and return to their respective 
stations. 892 

In the morning of 3 December, Capt Gregory Ramos, CO Alpha Coy 
2 LABde PALAR stationed in Tuburan, Mawab, Davao del Norte, left his 
station with 20 ofhis men and proceeded to Davao City. He had with him 
five armored vehicles consisting of two V-150, two AIFV and one APC. 
The vehicles were commanded by Lt Oscar Singson, Company EX-O, 
Sgts Leon Admachelo, Feliciano Gayla, Magin Montalban, and Nereo 
Macabenta. In Brgy Sasa, Davao City at around 10:00 a.m., they 
encountered a roadblock of ten wheeler trucks manned by elements of 
the PC METRODISCOM. They turned around and met Col Danilo Olay, 
CO 602 Bde, 6 ID, the immediate superior of Ramos. Olay observed that 
while they were at the roadblock, several junior officers from RSAF, CIS, 
METRODISCOM, and RSU spontaneously arrived. When Olay learned 
what the movement was all about, he brought Ramos and the whole 
group to Baccay at Camp Panacan. Some junior officers had prepared 
a manifesto expressing support and sympathy for the rebels' cause and 
sentiments against the AFP, 8 * 3 which Ramos handed to Baccay. There 
were two other armored vehicles from Calinan, Davao which arrived in 
Panacan. After a dialogue, the officers returned to barracks at 5:40 
p.m. 894 

L.4. Nasipit 

On 3 December 1989, the rebels tried to put on board the M/V Nasipit 
Princess and the M/V Don Calvino four armored personnel vehicles and 
an undetermined number of men from 402 Bde. 896 

Sometime during the day, Lt Anito Alfajardo, station commander, 
received a report that the radio operator of the M/V Nasipit Princess, 
while it was docked at the Nasipit wharf in Agusan del Norte, was 
approached by a man in civilian clothes and told to turn off all 
communications equipment. Later, at about 6:00 p.m., the Coast Guard 
sighted armed soldiers aboard six 6 x 6 trucks in the Nasipit wharf area. 
U Alfajardo forthwith motored from Butuan to Nasipit and, upon 
arrival, ordered elements of the Nasipit detachment to look for the ship 
paster of M/V Nasipit Princess. The ship master, Capt David Escalera, 
Jr was found at about 8:00 p.m. When he was informed of the situation, 



he voluntarily placed himself under the protection of the Coast Guard 
which hid him in a safehouse somewhere in Nasipit. 896 He remained 
there until the situation normalized in Metro Manila. This prevented 
the rebel group, of about 50 enlisted men of 30 IB, led by Lt Generoso 
Bolina, from using the vessel to proceed to Mactan. 897 

On the same day 3 December, a group of about 11 rebel soldiers 
commandeered the MAT La Lealtad, while it was docked at the Lumbacan 
pier in Butuan City, and forced its master, Capt Antonio Ambray, to 
proceed to the entrance of the Nasipit wharf, possibly to rendezvous with 
the M/V Nasipit Princess had the latter been able to set sail, or at least 
pick up some troops if for some reason the latter could not proceed. 
However, upon reaching the vicinity of the Nasipit pier, the master 
deliberately ran the vessel aground thereby disabling it. 898 

A third vessel which the rebels tried to board was the M/V Don 
Calvino. Their plans were likewise frustrated when the captain and the 
key crew members abandoned it. 899 

L.5. Resignations at Cagayan de Oro 

In the late afternoon of 7 December, a number of officers of the 4 ID 
met somewhere in Gusa, Cagayan de Oro City. A few of those who were 
at the meeting claimed that they were invited by Lt Amador Tabuga "to 
meet some of our classmates and co-peemayers in a get-together party." 800 
Nonetheless, it appears that on account of their concern with news 
reports of a possible bloody confrontation of rebel and government forces 
in Cebu as well as the media accounts of US military intervention in 
Metro Manila, the participants decided to arrange a dialogue with their 
CG, BGenRogelioVillanueva. For this purpose, Maj William Dormitorio 
was told to see the General at his office. 901 

Villanueva advised Dormitorio that, because a dialogue will involve 
a confrontation with his junior officers in Camp Evangelista away 
from their posts, he would talk to them only if they resigned. 902 M^j 
Dormitorio relayed the General's response to Lt Col Reynaldo Rivera 
who informed the rest. 903 

Accordingly, the officers individually signed resignation letters. The 
resignations were not filled out in the official form but simply in a pre- 
printed half-sheet of paper with blanks for their names distributed by 
one of the officers under Rivera. 904 Since Rivera was the most senior 
officer in the group, he was requested to carry the letters of resignation. 
Just before he left to see the General, Rivera requested Capt Santiago 



CHAPTER V 373 



Pascual to accompany him and carry all the resignations except Rivera's, 
which he carried himself. 906 

Villanueva, upon being presented the letters of resignation, m§t 
with the officers from 9:00 p.m. of 7 December up to 3:00 a.m. of 8 
December. The dialogue, though centering on the grievances of the 
officers, consisting mostly of national issues, was described as "conducted 
in a cordial manner. W90fi At the end, Villanueva told the officers that he 
was not accepting their resignations and ordered them to return to their 
posts. 

Before the officers could do so, they were told to stay because MGen 
(Ret) Mariano Adalem and BGen Arturo Enrile were en route from Metro 
Manila to see them. At 8:00 a.m. of 8 December, a second dialogue was 
thus held. The officers repeated their grievances to Adalem and Enrile 
and thereafter were told to return to their respective stations. 

The affidavits submitted by the officers uniformly maintain that 
the affiants did not intend to resign and that they did so only to fulfill 
the condition precedent set by their CGfor a dialogue. Thus, Capt Ruben 
Clarito claimed to have torn up his resignation letter after it was 
returned to him. 907 

M. Possible US Involvement 

Newspaper accounts every now and then have appeared since 1986 
reporting the alleged presence of American intelligence personnel on the 
occasion of past coup attempts. For example, the US Defense Intelligence 
Agency (DIA) was reported to have promised to deliver food and aviation 
fuel to the RAM in case they launched a coup against then President 
Marcos in 1986. DIA, it was said, did not keep its promise. 908 

Thereafter, a US Embassy spokesman by the name of Allan Croughan, 
confirmed that a US Vice Consul, in the absence of Ambassador Stephen 
Bosworth who was then on leave, privately conferred with Arturo 
Tolentino when the latter and other Marcos loyalists occupied the 
Manila Hotel in July 1986. Croughan justified his actuations by 
saying that: "We do it everytime [something like this develops] to get 
an appraisal of the situation." 909 

In early January 1987, Col James Nicholson, officially a US Military 
Attache, was photographed talking with the rebels at the GMA-7 during 
the occupation of the station. 910 



374 



Then Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, Fidel 
Ramos, officially wrote to former Secretary of National Defense, Rafael 
Ileto, that several Americans were said to have been seen closely 
following the 28 August 1987 coup attempt. Lt Col Victor Rafael, who 
was formerly a US Military Attache to the Philippines, allegedly tried 
to dissuade Col Dado from attacking Camp Aguinaldo, where Gregorio 
Honasan was at the time. Col Rafael was said to be the godfather of 
Honasan's son. Also, M^j Dennis Fayler was supposedly seen at the 
perimeter of the Villamor Air Base on board his armored car, monitoring 
the events there. Finally, a certain Stephen Herry was purportedly 
observed monitoring the August 1987 coup attempt. 911 

In the December 1989 coup attempt, the rebels took advantage of the 
Balikatan Exercise (Balikatan), a RP-US military exercise, to provide 
cover for their troop involvements. According to BGen Lisandro Abadia, 
Balikatan is a regular annual joint RP-US activity. It was scheduled 
for 4 December 1989. The Balikatan consisted of field exercises, where 
actual troops were involved, and command post exercises where simulated 
war games were conducted. It is normal for the JUSMAG people, 
particularly the American officers, to participate. The American parti- 
cipants usually billeted themselves in hotels (in December 1989, in 
Nikko) from where they are bussed every morning and every night to 
and from Fort Bonifacio and Villamor Air Base. The Americans parti- 
cipating normally arrive one week before the scheduled opening. Thus, 
these American military personnel were already in the Philippines prior 
to 1 December 1989. 912 

A noteworthy part of Balikatan 1989 was the use of sophisticated 
communications equipment by the American participants. The commu- 
nications equipment are such that from where they are or from where, 
they were, "You can lift up the phone and you can call anywhere in the 
world." 913 

Col Samson Mahimer, 1989 Director of Balikatan , testified that the 
intended role of the US military personnel, was "as tutors for group 
training" . Col Mahimer also stated that the communications system 
held by the Americans at that time were "state of the art communications 
system, either wired or wireless." 914 

Upon inquiry by the Commission, BGen Cardones stated in a letter 
that, during the period, 1 September 1987 to 1 December 1989, American 
military personnel participated in communications training activities 
for the appropriate units in the entire PA, including FSSR personnel and 
FSSR HQ communication facilities at Fort Bonifacio. 915 Furthermore, 



CHAPTER V 375 



Col Urgello confirmed in a letter to the Commission that "11 special 
communications courses had been evaluated by five US instructors at 
the FSRR Compound in Fort Bonifacio from 1987 to 1989." 91 * 

At Sangley, during the morning of 1 December, there were two US 
Navy ships anchored, reportedly as part of Balikatan. 

It is reasonable to suppose, regardless of whether or not US military 
persons were in Philippine military camps only coincidentally because 
of Balikatan , that they were, at least, closely monitoring the developments 
of the December 1989 coup attempt. 

Duringhis testimony before the Commission, Press Secretary Tomas 
Gomez mentioned an H Natzke as supposedly having been a CIA agent 
attached to the US Embassy in Manila during the early '70s and now 
working for Lucio Tan in San Francisco. Secretary Gomez remembered 
Natzke because a photograph of his daughter with rebel soldiers in 
Makati appeared in one of the Honolulu newspapers. According to 
Secretary Gomez, he inquired and was told that Natzke was here during 
the last coup. 917 The Commission, on the other hand, discovered that Apt 
19-C in Twin Towers, Ayala Ave. , Makati, is listed as occupied by Helbert 
Natzke and owned by Arithmos International. 918 

A video tape provided the Commission shows a helicopter load of 
US Marines landing and deploying at the US Embassy grounds on 
2 December. 919 

While the Commission does not believe that the foregoing events 
constitute proof ofUS involvement in past coup attempts, the Commission, 
nevertheless, urges the government to look deeper into this matter. 
Considering American strategic interests in the Philippines, it is both 
logical and prudent for the government to do so. The Commission, not 
having any military intelligence capability or recourse to diplomatic 
channels, is neither equipped nor possessed of the necessary authority 
to effectively pursue such an investigation. For example, when the 
Commission sought to interview US Naval Attache Capt Thomas Mann 
in connection with his having reported to AFP GHQ that a wall of Camp 
Aguinaldo had been breached by the rebels during the last attempted 
c °up, the US Embassy invoked, pro forma, his diplomatic immunity.

N.3. Philippine Airlines 

Levy Rebanal, vice president of PAL for Risk and Insurance 
Management, testified that the net revenue loss due to the coup amounted 
to PI 12 million plus P9 million attributable to the takeover of Mactan. 
The loss of revenue after the coup for the months of January to March, 
based on a projected growth rate of 10 percent to 12 percent, was 
estimated at 1*226 million. 922 

N*4. Tourism 

At the time, right after the coup, Tourism Secretary Peter Garrucho 
estimated that the hotel occupancy in Metro Manila could plunge to alow 
40 percent. 923 

N.5. Stock Trading, Investments, and Prices 

Stock trading slumped to a volume of 2.6 billion shares from 3.9 
billion shares in 29 November 1989. Since then, volume and value of 
stock traded generally remained on the low side reflectingthe reluctance 
of investors to raise their market exposure. 924 

A marked drop in the initial paid-up capital investments was 
recorded during the week of the coup. Investments declined by 
83.7 percent, from 1*297.8 million during the week of 7 November to 
1 December, to P48.4 million after 1 December. For the month of 
December, initial paid-up capital investments dropped to ^343.86 
million from T 963. 77 million recorded during November. 926 

N.6. Total Losses 

Combined financial losses due to the December 1989 failed coup 
attempt, based on the figures above, would be in the order of "P800 
million to 1*1 billion. But the loss of lives, loss of confidence and damage 
to our international image are worth far more than the financial losses.

THE FAILED DECEMBER 1989 COUP: WHO? 



Who staged it? 

This is the first question that is asked when a coup d'etat occurs. In 
the Philippines, because the same groups of plotters led by the same key 
conspirators surfaced again and again in the seven coup attempts after 
the historic EDSA People Power Revolt, this question is no longer asked 
with a sense of urgency. Media have served to satisfy the curiosity of the 
public. However, the conclusions that one can derive from media reports 
are not sufficient for purposes of establishing legal accountability or for 
recommendations to deter coups in the future. 

The Fact-Finding Commission's mandate includes the identification 
of military personnel and civilian personalities, including public officials 
and employees, who may be involved in the failed December 1989 coup 
attempt. The Commission is tasked to turn over to the appropriate 
prosecutorial authorities all pertinent evidence when in the course of its 
investigation it finds that there is reasonable ground to believe that an 
individual appears to be liable for a criminal offense in connection with 
the coup. 

This chapter provides statistical data for a general profile of the coup 
participants, particularly the military rebels. It also focuses on the 
leaders. Civilian personalities who were probably involved in the coup 
are discussed separately. The chapter ends with the Commission's 
recommendations on what in its judgment should be the appropriate 
action in each case. 

It is not, however, the duty of the Commission to determine whether 
ftey are guilty of participating in the coup. The Commission is required 
under RANo. 6832 to find out if the evidence in its possession is sufficient 
to ^ate a reason^ pr rmmrf tn faliflv fithp* ™* annpnra tfl he liable for 
amffensft i n f onnprtinn with the coup . Reasonable ground exists when 



434 



there is a rational basis to conclude that an individual was indeed 
involved. The function of the Commission is neither to prosecute, indict 
nor convict, but only to provide leads for investigatory and prosecutorial 
agencies to pursue them in accordance with the requirements of due 
process. 

A. Sourcing of Evidence 

To fulfill its mandate, the Commission took the testimonies of 332 
witnesses in open or closed-door sessions, and received the sworn 
statements or affidavits, or caused the re-affirmation of sworn statements 
or affidavits earlier executed, of 226 witnesses. The Commission also 
obtained various records and documents, produced before it either 
during its sessions or in the taking of the sworn statements, or by virtue 
of subpoenas duces tecum or official requests, which were then marked 
as Exhibits. The latter included documents from, but not limited to, (1) 
the Office of the AFP Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel (Jl), (2) the 
Office of the AFP Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence (J2), (3) the AFP 
Office of The Inspector General (AFPTIG), (4) the Investigating 
Committees of the Major Service Commands, (5) the AFP Special 
Investigating Committee (AFPSIC), and (6) the Department of Justice 
(DOJ). 

From the above oral and documentary evidence, the names of 
individuals probably involved in the failed December 1989 coup were 
gathered and classified either as military or civilian participants. 

B. Creating the Data Base for Military Participants 

Considering the sheer number of military personnel involved, two 
types of computer data bases were made to facilitate evaluation and 
analysis. The first, described as Masterlist of Military Officers 
Probably Involved in the Failed December 1989 Cour is attached 
to this Report as Appendix J. The other, known as the Masterlist of 
Enlisted Personnel Probably Involved in the Failed December 
1989 Coup, is attached as Appendix K of this Report. Appendix K-l is 
the Masterlist of OCS Students Probably Involved in the Failed 
December 1989 Coup. 

An analysis of the officers 1 data base was undertaken to obtain a 
better profile of the principal leaders and unit heads involved in the coup. 

The computer data base for the officers includes the name listing and 
the particulars for each name such as rank, serial number, service 



CHAPTER VI 435 



command, unit of assignment, personnel status, source of commission, 
present disposition, category of involvement, nature of participation, 
reference, and the status of investigation with recommendations of the 
Commission whenever appropriate. 

Present Disposition shows the present whereabouts of the subject — 
whether at-large, detained, released, resigned, or cleared after 

investigation. 

Category of Involvement identifies the individual listed as any of 
the following: 

(a) Implicated means that the Commission's records show that 
the individual participated in the coup by direct action; 

(b) Sympathizer means that the individual indirectly supported 
the coup by some outward act such as orally expressing support 
for the rebel cause, e.g., by tendering his resignation or by 
inverting the flag; 

(c) Suspected means that the name of the individual appeared in 
one or more documents submitted to the Commission showing 
some involvement in the coup but his specific participation is 
not clear. 

Under the column of Nature of Participation, the Commission 
describes the acts committed by the military personnel involved. The 
descriptions were made on the basis of testimonies, sworn statements 
and affidavits, and other exhibits submitted to the Commission. This 
column is the basis for the Commission's recommendations as to what 
further action should be taken, if any, for each military personnel listed 
as probably involved. It must be noted that other government agencies, 
particularly the military and the DOJ, have already taken steps towards 
the prosecution, or the release of some of those in the list. 

Referpn^ft indicates the basis for the involvement or the nature of 
foe participation. 

The action taken by military authorities on each of those appearing 
in the list are indicated under the column Status of Investigation. This 
column shows the status of the military's investigation. There are four 
classes under this category: 

(1) EoxPH(Pre-Trial Investigation) means that the case has been 



436 



transmitted to the Trial Judge Advocate General (TJAG) for 
PTI pursuant to Article of War (AW) 7 1 1 and Section 35(a), 
Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM) 2 and for trial before a General 
Court-Martial (GCM) for violation of AW 67, 3 AW 94 4 in relation 
to Articles 6 and 248 (Murder) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), 
and AW 96 6 and for such other violations and crimes as may be 
found during the course of the PTI; 

(2) For GCM (General Court-Martial) means that a PTI had been 
conducted and that violation/s liable to a GCM had been 
committed; 

(3) Released with Reprimand means that the case was closed and 
the person released was given a reprimand by his commanding 
officer and/or a forfeiture of base pay in favor of the government 
pursuant to Section [a] [1] [b] [4] MCM as amended? 

(4) Cleared means that the case has been dropped or closed by 
AFPSIC and approved by the Chief of Staff; 

(5) Under Investigation means that the person is currently detained 
either in stockade, house arrest, or camp arrest by order of a 
Commanding Officer and/or a General Order of the most senior 
officer while his case awaits resolution; and 

(6) Referred to DOJ means that the case of the person, being a 
retired or dismissed military personnel, has been referred to 
the Justice Department . 

Those released with reprimand and cleared would have to (a) 
undergo a seminar on military discipline (AFPR G 13 1 dated 7 November 
1974) and on crimes against public order (Article 134 - 142, RPC), and 
(b) pledge support to the Constitution, the duly constituted authorities, 
and the AFP chain of command verbally and in writing and in appropriate 
ceremonies before they are restored to duty status. 

C. General Profile of Coup Participants 

The report from the AFPSIC dated 30 April 1990 7 gives a total 
number of 2,290 (470 officers and 1,820 enlisted men) military personnel 
allegedly involved in the December 1989 failed coup. For consistency in 
comparison, the number of enlisted personnel deemed cleared by the 
AFPSIC was not included as the Commission's own figures already 
excluded such data. The Commission's own tally sheet, which includes 



CHAPTER VI 437 



retired, resigned, and dismissed officers, has a total of 2,911 (469 officers, 
70 officer candidates and 2,372 enlisted men), which is 27.1 percent 
more than the listing of the military referred to in the above. Of the 469 
officers, 238 were classified as implicated, 40 of whom have been 
released after study of their cases by the AFPSIC or the AFPTIG and the 
metingout of appropriate penalties, where necessary. Majority of those 
classified as sympathizers, about 40 of the total of 69, were from the 4 
ID. More than one-third (162) of the officers remain in the suspected 
category. The Commission did not include in its list those cleared 
without penalties, except for 20 cleared cases where the Commission 
recommends that they be reviewed. 

The above total of 2,911 military personnel is 130.5 percent more 
than those in the August 1987 episode which had 1,263 participants. 8 
The total number in the December 1989 incident exceeds the combined 
rebel manpower of 1,683 for of all the four coup attempts in 1987 9 as 
shown in Table VI- 1.

Summary of the Historical Profile of the AFP from 1987-1990, Exh. "SSSSSS"- Commission. 

Among the major service commands, the Philippine Army (PA) 
contributed the biggest number to the rebel military group. As shown in 



438 



Table VI- 1 above, the Army accounted for 55 percent of military personnel 
probably involved (MPPI) in both the 1987 and 1989 incidents. Such a 
result could be expected since the Army has the largest population in 
terms of personnel as shown in the same table. The reverse is true with 
respect to the Philippine Air Force (PAF). It has the least number of men, 
which therefore accounts for the smallest number of MPPI in 1989. 
Operationally, the coup plotters will naturally target the Army for its 
vast number of infantry men and the Air Force for the destructive power 
of its fighter planes with only a small number of pilots needed to fly them. 

Much more revealing are the data on the service command which has 
the lowest number of MPPI. In the 1987 coup attempts, the Philippine 
Navy (PN) had the least number of MPPI. In 1989, however, the Navy 
had the second highest number of MPPI due to the involvement of the 
Philippine Marines. 

An interesting comparison is the increase of MPPI in the 1987 and 
1989 failed coup attempts as shown in Table VI-2. The MPPI from the 
Army almost doubled. The main cause is the direct participation of the 
First Scout Ranger Regiment (FSRR), several Ranger companies, and 
several Ranger battalions. The participation of rebel Marines gave rise 
to a 1,218.8 percent increase in MPPI from the Navy. There is also the 
notable decrease in Air Force MPPI in the December 1989 failed coup. 
This highlights the steadfastness of most of the Air Force officers and 
men in resisting rebel attempts to use them and their aircrafts against 
the government.

CHAPTER VI 439 



It is obvious that the December 1989 coup plotters targeted the Scout 
Rangers and the Marines for recruitment. The plotters were only too 
aware of the distinct culture of cohesiveness of these units, and their 
extreme loyalty to their commanders. 

Table VI-3 below provides a breakdown of the aggregate number of 
military personnel probably involved in the December 1989 coup.

As thus shown, out of the 2,91 1 MPPI, 469 were officers. More than 
half were from the Army. As stated earlier, the list includes officers who 
had retired, resigned, or been dismissed. The ratio of officers to the total 
number of military personnel is 1:5, i.e., one out of every six MPPI was 
an officer. This is a marked increase in officer participation when 
compared to 1987 which had one officer out of ten MPPI. 10 

Majority of the OPI in the last coup, 304 or 64.8 percent, are under 
detention. Seventy three, however, remain at-large. The rest have been 
cleared, released or resigned; a number have yet to be investigated. 

Of the officers involved in the 1989 coup, 77 were repeaters meaning 
fcey were involved in at least one other previous coup attempt. Among 
the enlisted personnel, at least 123 were found to have been involved in 
lie 1987 coup attempts. Repeaters among officers and men comprise 6.9 
Percent of the total MPPI in 1989. 



440 



An observation made in the Commission's first Interim Report was 
that the operational execution of the failed coup attempts before 1989 
was in the hands of junior officers. A similar case is noted for the 
December 1989 incident where officers with ranks of lieutenants and 
captains form 73.8 percent of the total number of officers probably 
involved (OPI). This confirms the reports that the recruiters were 
concentrating on battalion and company commanders as part of the 
strategic and tactical mobilization and deployment offerees plan for the 
coup.

Another interesting data is the comparison of figures of OPI who are 
either PMA or non-PMA graduates. Although PMA alumni comprise 
only 15 percent of the AFP officer corps, a segment of them were very 
visible and quite active in the past coup attempt. 11 

A little over nine percent of officers from the PMA are listed as OPI 
in the December 1989 coup attempt while only 2.2 percent of officers who 
are non-PMA are OPI (See Table VI-5). 

While indeed the major players of the December 1989 coup came 
from the country's premiere military school, the figures bear out the fact 
that rebel PMA alumni is an aberration, not the norm. Nevertheless, the 
figures should provide directions for the national and military leadership 
» concentrating their efforts in reforms.

Sixty-six officers participated twice, nine officers thrice, one was 
implicated in four attempts, while another, ex-Col Rolando Abadilla, the 
current Vice Governor of Ilocos Norte, was allegedly involved in five coup 
attempts, but excluding December 1989. Sixty-three officers were 
involved in both the August 1987 and 1989 attempts. Seventy-one 
officers implicated in 1989 were also involved in previous coups. 

D. The Leaders of the December 1989 Failed Coup 

The December 1989 failed coup is no doubt the most serious and 
costliest attempt against the Aquino government, involving the most 
number of troops. This could be attributed to the tactical alliance forged 
between the RAM - Honasan Faction (RAM-HF) and the Loyalists. The 
latter refer to officers identified with the group of BGen Zumel and Gen 
Fabian Ver. 

D.l. RAM-HF/MND Connection 

The overall planning and plotting of the December 1989 coup appear 
to have been principally handled by ex-Lt Col Gregorio Honasan PA 
The operational, tactical, and implementation responsibilities appearto 
have been placed in the hands of the core group of the RAM-HF, namely, 
Lt Cols Victor Batac PC and Eduardo Kapunan PAF, ex-Capt (PN) Felix 
Turingan, Ex-LCmdr (PN) Jaime Lucas, ex-Lt Cols Oscar Legaspi PAF 
and Billy Bibit PC, and M^j Abraham Purugganan PA. All of them, 
except Bibit, were implicated in previous coup attempts. The members 
of this core group are representative of the four m^jor service commands 
of the AFP. All are graduates of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA), 
Classes '65 -'78. 

The involvement of Honasan, Batac, Kapunan, Lucas, Legaspi, and 
Turingan is traceable to February 1986. They were also involved in the 
November 1986 "God Save The Queen* plot and the 28 August 1987 coup 
attempt. 12 Honasan, Batac, Kapunan, Lucas, Legaspi, and Turingan 
had spent the major part of their military service with the Ministry (now 
Department) of National Defense (MND) under then Minister Juan 
Ponce Enrile. 13 Three years after his graduation from the PMA, Honasan 
was detailed to the MND beginning 1 September 1974 until Enrile was 
removed from his position in November 1986. By then, Honasan was 
Enrile' s Special Assistant on Security Matters. 

Batac, Kapunan, and Turingan started their assignment at the 
MND in 1979. By September 1986, Kapunan was a member of the 
security group at the Office of the Minister. Turingan, on the otherhand, 



CHAPTER VI 445 



was Chief of the Information Management Office (IMO) and Legaspi 
was Senior Aide-de-Camp to Minister Enrile. 

Other major players in the last coup who are identified with the 
RAM-HF are Honasan's other classmates, Lt Cols Tiburcio Fusilero 
(who also served at the MND) and Marcelino Malajacan. Lt Col Ericson 
Aurelio, Col Alexander Noble, and Cmdr Proceso Maligaligalso featured 
prominently in the last attempt. Aurelio, while at the MND from 
November 1984 to April 1986, was also consultant on security and police 
matters of the Export Processing Zone Authority under Atty Renato 
Cayetano, who was then Deputy Minister for Trade and Industry and 
now a law partner of Enrile. Maligalig was also assigned to MND during 
Enrile's incumbency. Enrile paid for his tuition fees at AIM where he 
graduated in 1982. 14 Maligalig and Noble belong to PMA Class '69. 

Other officers in the MPPI list who served at the MND during 
Enrile's incumbency are Lt Col Reynaldo Rivera, ex-Lt Andy Gauran, 
Navy Capt Jesus Durian, and Lt Rolando Cal. 15 

Batac, Honasan, Kapunan, and Legaspi were classmates at the PMA 
(Class 71). Except for Legaspi, these PMAers are also graduates of the 
Asian Institute of Management (AIM). ' 

The other classmates of Honasan in the MPPI list are Lt Cols Levy 
Zamora, Diosdado Tabamo, Teodorico Viduya, Reynaldo Rivera, Eduardo 
Matillano, Neon Ebuen, and Rafael Galvez. 

Bibit and Aurelio were classmates at the PMA (Class 72). Their 
other classmates who were involved in the last coup are ex-Lt Col Rodolfo 
Aguinaldo and Majs Alfredo Oliveros, Rodolfo Tor, and Leuvino Valencia. 
The latter could be the link with the 3rd Scout Ranger Battalion which 
took over the Legaspi Airport as this unit was under him from February 
1987 to September 1989, as was Capt Jaime Junio of the 14th Scout 
Ranger Company who led the attack against the PAF Repeater Station 
inTagaytay City. 

Purugganan's links with Honasan may have begun when the former 
was the commanding officer (CO) of the 7th Scout Ranger Company 
stationed in Isabela and the latter was the CO of the Special Operations 
School of the Philippine Army Training Command (SOS PA TRACOM) 
at Port Magsaysay in Palayan City, Nueva Ecija. Both were at Camp 
Aguinaldo during the August 1987 coup attempt. Honasan made full 

of his SOS position. Also implicated in the last coup were Capts 
Edmundo Malabanjot, Fidel Legiralde, and Dominador Lina, all 



446 



reservists. The three were course directors of Scout Ranger Training 
Classes at the SOS. 16 

D.2. Honasan/GCFI Network 

There can be no doubt that some members of the Guardian Centre 
Foundation, Inc (GCFI) were used by Honasan during the December 
1989 coup attempt. 

Honasan leads the list of the incorporators of the Foundation. 17 
Rodolfo Morit, Jr is the second in the list. Three other incorporators - 
SSgt Nicanor Cagurangan, MSgt Rogelio Attunaga, and MSgt Leovides 
Montehermoso - were with Honasan at the MND Security Group during 
Enrile's incumbency as Minister of National Defense. 

It may be recalled that Honasan signed as an instrumental witness 
to the Articles of Incorporation of the Guardians Brotherhood, Inc 
(GBI). 18 

During the December 1989 coup, Morit met his brother-Guardians 
at the Bureau of Corrections in Muntinlupa. In the evening of 30 
November, he brought 26 prison guards (all Guardians) and four civilians 
to the Baltao Subdivision in Paranaque. In the early morning of 1 
December, they were picked up by Gamos, Vice President Laurel's Chief 
of Security, and brought to the Velayo Sports Complex fronting the 
Manila Domestic Airport terminal where they were to be provided with 
firearms. 

In the morning of 30 November, 30 to 40 GCFI members from Baguio 
City led by the chapter president, Assistant City Prosecutor Elmer 
Sagsago, went to the North Harbor, allegedly to attend a GCFI conference. 
At the same meeting were some 40 heavily armed men in military 
uniform and others in civilian attire. These men reportedly asked 
Sagsago and his group to join in the coup activity. Sagsago, however, 
claimed that they refused to do so and that he and the rest of the GCFI- 
Baguio Chapter members left in groups of two or three. The leader of the 
armed group was ex-Capt Dante Pimentel, also a GCFI member. 

P/Capt Job Gavino, Station Commander (STACOM) of the North 
Harbor Port Police was contacted by RAM-HF core group member Bibit 
at 7:30 a.m. of 30 November. In his testimony before the Commission, 
Job Gavino admitted that he is a member of the GCFI. 



CHAPTER VI 447 



The rebels who attacked and ransacked the Civil Relations Service 
(CRS) office of the late CRS Chief BGen Oscar Florendo in the early 
morning of 1 December were also Guardians. They were led by Dante 
Pimentel who used to be the Finance Officer of CRS. He has resigned his 
commission. 19 

D.3. The Loyalists 

The Loyalist rebels who played prominent and visible roles and 
listed in the MPPI were, at one time or another, assigned to the 
Presidential Security Command (PSC) and/or the National Intelligence 
and Security Agency (NISA) under Gen Fabian Ver. They include 
Zumel, Cols Anselmo Avenido, and Luisito Sanchez, Navy Capt Danilo 
Pizarro, Lt Cols Arsenio Tecson, Rafael Galvez, Jacinto Ligot, Jerry 
Albano, Romelino Gojo, and Maj Alfredo Oliveros. Tecson and Gojo are 
both classmates of Col Irwin Ver, son of Gen Ver, at the PMA. 

Pizarro was at one time the commanding officer of Ang Pangulo, 
former President Marcos's presidential yacht. LCmdr Perfecto Pascual 
was already assigned to the PSC when Pizarro joined the unit. 

Capt Danilo Lim, on the other hand, used to be Zumel's aide-de- 
camp when the latter was the PMA Superintendent. 

Thus, while they were linked to Ver and Marcos, Oliveros, Galvez, 
and Gojo also have special links with Honasan. Galvez and Albano were 
Honasan's classmates at the PMA. Oliveros was in the batch behind 
Honasan's class and Gojo is a Honasan kin. 

D.4. Abenina - The Middleman 

Although there were indications of possible collaboration in past 
coup attempts between the Honasan group and the Loyalists, there was, 
for the December 1989 coup, a need for a more effective alliance. Both 
groups had the same objective — to remove President Aquino from 
Power. Considering, however, that they were opposing forces during the 
EDSA Revolt, someone had to act as middleman. That role was tailor- 
made for BGen Edgardo Abenina, a known supporter of the rightist 
movement who was implicated and charged for involvement in the 28 
August 1987 attempt. 20 BGens Abenina and Zumel were classmates at 
the PMA (Class '58). Abenina was Regional Command (RECOM) 7 
commander during the August 1987 attempt, when he revealed his 
supportfortherebelsbyinvertingthePhilippineflagathisheadquarters. 

Charged with him were Avenido, Fusilero, and Tor. 



448 



D.5. BGens Comendador and Blando and Commo Calajate 

A surprise to the AFP was the participation ofBGen Jose Comendador, 
Commander 2nd Air Division, BGen Marcelo Blando, Commanding 
General (CG) 7 ID, and Commo Domingo Calajate, Commander AFP 
Logistics Command (LOGCOM). According to Chief of Staff Gen Renato 
de Villa, Comendador could have been recruited by Fusilero. Blando's 
pro-rebel stand was not known until he was at Greenhills Commercial 
Center, although the rebel Rangers at Fort Bonifacio expected his 
arrival there as early as 1 December. Blando used to be the CG of the 
FSRR. It must be noted that in a meeting with de Villa on the Monday 
preceding the coup, Blando pledged his loyalty to him. Calegate, in turn, 
attended the Command Conference called by de Villa at 5:30 p.m. on 30 
November at the headquarters of the Intelligence Service of the AFP 
(ISAFP). 

D.6. Other Major Participants 

The details of the activities of the other major participants in the 
December 1989 coup attempt like Fusilero, Bibit, Noble, and the officers 
of the various units which moved against the government are discussed 
in Chapter V and their names, category of involvement, and nature of 
participation are shown in Appendix J.

D.7. Enlisted Personnel 

A total of 2,372 enlisted personnel were involved in the failed 
December coup and the category of their involvement is listed in 
Appendix K. 

DA Civilian Participants 

While a coup is primarily a military operation, the task of the 
Commission is to examine all the involvements in the December 1989 
attempt including those of civilians. Thus, the Commission followed up 
on several leads about possible civilian participation. 

The DND Special Investigation Committee (DND SIC) in its Third 
Egress Report 21 mentioned foreigners as allegedly involved in the 
«jup. One name mentioned was Eito Eikiuchi, who was described as a 
"ikely coup supporter/participant." 

The Commission took note of the sworn statements of former 
C G Southern Luzon Command BGen Alejandro Galido which named 
**ral civilians, including Homobono Adaza, Baby Asistio, Rafael 



450 



Ayoste (deceased), Cherry Cobarrubias, Enrique "Henry" Cojuangco,, 
Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, Eduardo Figueras, retired BGen Romeo 
Gatan Lito Gorospe, Cesar Lopez, former First Lady Mrs Imelda 
Marcos, Rico Mendoza (alleged friend of Eduardo "Danding* Cojuangco, 
Jr), Luis Tabuena, Joaquin Venus, Jr, and a certain Mel Verano. 22 

D.8.a. Cases Filed Before the DOJ 

The Commission, likewise, obtained copies of the complaints or 
charges, and the supporting documents, filed with the Department of 
Justice against civilians allegedly involved in the coup attempt. Classi- 
fied among civilians are retired, resigned or dismissed military officers. 
As of 29 August 1990 the following civilianshavebeen charged before the 
DOJ 23

CHAPTER VI 451 



Matillano, Tor and de la Cruz were charged with Rolando de Gracia, 
Chito Henson, Pablo Dee, Jr, Harry Uyson, and John Does for illegal 
possession of ammunitions and explosives in furtherance of rebellion. 24 
The Department of Justice dismissed the cases against Uyson, Dee, and 
de la Cruz and referred the case of Matillano to the military authorities 
for appropriate action. The President waived court-martial jurisdiction 
over Tor and de la Cruz. In its Resolution in the case against Recto, et 
al, 26 the DOJ excluded/absolved Edgardo Castro and Joaquin Rodriguez 
for insufficiency of evidence. 

The cases against Job Gavino, Antonio Arriola, Matias Tamayo, 
Manuel Coching, Ronnie Abundo, Francisco Tamayao, Augusto Pilapil, 
Renato Villanueva, Ernesto Domingo, Arturo Navarro, and Armando 
Manuel were dismissed by DOJ, without prejudice, for lack of evidence. 26 

The case against BGen (Ret) Jaime Echeverria was similarly 
dismissed by DOJ. 

As of 29 August 1990, the DOJ had filed the following information 

1. People of the Philippines vs Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, Gregorio

As regards the others, the Commission pursued some leads to gather 
evidence. Some "informants" who wrote letters could not be contacted at 
the addresses given ; others who appeared to testify before the Commission 
denied any role in the coup. "Eikiuchi", the Japanese mentioned in the 
DND SIC Report, is actually Eito Ikeuchi, a Filipino citizen (with a 
Filipina mother and a Japanese father) who was born in the Philippines. 
Ikeuchi is a martial arts instructor at the PMA and a member of the 
GCFI, Baguio Chapter. 

D&b. Eduardo (Danding) Cojuangco, Jr. 

Being the estranged cousin of President Aquino and one of the 
Twelve Disciples, Twelve Apostles or the Rolex 12 of former President 
Marcos, and having left with the Marcoses at the height of the EDSA 
Revolt, it was inevitable that there would be speculation as to Eduardo 
(Danding) Cojuangco's possible involvement in the coup. 

p Although the Commission did not uncover any direct evidence that 
Danding was a plotter or participant, the staging of the coup a few days 
after his mystery-shrouded arrival, in the light of some facts which 
surfaced during the hearings or which were unearthed through subpoenas 
duces tecum, raises reasonable ground to believe that he had prior 
knowledge of the staging of the coup. 

In addition to the detailed discussions on the probability of his 
arrival on 23 November 1989 in Malita, Davao del Sur from Kota 
Kinabalu in Chapter V, the following facts further aid reasonable minds 
to such conclusion: 

1. Danding got his passport when his counsel inquired from the 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) whether or not the Presidential 



454 



Commission on Good Government (PCGG) had lifted the hold order on 
him. The DFA checked with PCGG. The letter of inquiry was draftedty 
Edgardo Castro, then Acting Director of the Passport Division. The first 
and second letters to PCGG went unanswered. He persevered with a 
third letter which was answered in the affirmative. The telex to the 
Philippine Consulate in Los Angeles with instructions to issue the 
passport was again drafted by Edgardo Castro. 46 

Incidentally, the same Castro did not report to his office on 1 
December; instead, after lunch, he went with a group headed by Rafael 
Recto to PTV-4. He testified that he had been listening to the radio that 
morning. Therefore, he clearly knew that PTV-4 was held by the rebels. 
His excuse for going there was to help look for Recto's daughter, Plinky. 
He knew Plinky worked for ABS-CBN, not PTV-4, but during their stay 
at the ABS-CBN/PTV-4 complex, not one in their group went to ABS- 
CBN to look for Plinky. Not one in their group asked any of the persons 
they met for the whereabouts of Plinky . None in their group even looked 
at the parking lot of Channel 2 to see if Plinky's car was there. On the 
other hand, witness Orlando Fontanilla swore that he overheard Recto 
asking about a press conference in PTV-4. 

2. In his sworn statement, Galido declared that he had a meeting 
with Henry Cojuangco where the participation of Dandingin the planned 
coup was discussed. 

3. Dandingis close to BGen Zumel as they both served under or were 
close to Marcos. 

4. As to when and where he landed when he returned home was 
never disclosed by him. Although he was given the fullest opportunity 
when he testified before the Commission on 11 May 1990 to make such 
a disclosure if only to end speculations and unravel the mystery 
surrounding his arrival, he deliberately refused to do so. Although he 
has the opportunity to deny the imputations made against him in the 
sworn statement of Galido, the Commission is not aware that he has 
publicly done so. 

5. Since he was given a proper Philippine passport, it is difficult to 
understand why he had to enter the country covertly, particularly since 
as a political and public figure, he presumably would want to rally his 
followers to his side. 



CHAPTER VI 455 



D&c. Vice President Salvador Laurel 

The actuations of Vice President Laurel are discussed in Chapter 

VII. 

D&d. Other Civilian Participants 

The Commission finds reasonable ground to believe that in addition 
to those charged before the DOJ, or whose cases had been dismissed by 
the DOJ, the civilians named below may also be liable for offenses in 
connection with the failed December 1989 coup. 

1. Diane Aguas 

she is linked to one Franco Sanchijo and Cherry 
Cobarrubias, 46 

2. Roger Borja 

one of the four civilians who, with 26 prison guards 
(members of the Guardians) of the Bureau of Corrections 
in Muntinlupa, were brought by Rodolfo Morit, Jr in the 
evening of 30 November 1989 to the Baltao Subdivision, 
Paranaque, from where they were picked up by Gamos 
in the early morning of 1 December and brought to the 
VelayoSportsComplexneartheManilaDomesticAirport 
terminal where they were to be provided with firearms 
by the group of Gamos, 47 

3. Nicanor Cagurangan 

the Founder Barorot of GCFI, per sworn testimony of 
Elmer Sagsago given on 5 May 1990, who was expected 
to meet the GCFI members gathered at the PPA, 
North Harbor, in the evening of 30 November 1989; an 
incorporator of GCFI with Honasan and Morit, 48 

4. Francisco Casio 

he was among those who barricaded the Moriones and 
the Zaragosa gates of the North Harbor and was seen 
in the company of rebel soldiers, 49 



5. Edgardo Castro 



he was Acting Director of the Passport Division at the 
DFA when Danding Cojuangco's application for a 
passport was approved; did not report to his office on 1 
December; went with Rafael Recto to PTV-4 which he 
knew was occupied by rebels ostensibly to look for 
Recto's daughter Plinky, 

6. Cherry Cobarrubias or 
Serafia C. Cobarrubias 

she is implicated in the sworn statement of Galido; she 
arranged an overseas call between Mrs Marcos and 
BGen Galido; per the testimony of Luis Tabuena, she 
is very close to the Marcoses and she also arranged 
his meeting with Galido at the Mandarin Hotel on 6 
September 1989; per admission of BGen Tadiar, she 
attended the meeting at ahouse in Times Street, Quezon 
City between Tadiar, Galido and Cesar Lopez; and on 29 
November 1989, she checked in at the Philippine Village 
Hotel, although she has a house in Quezon City and at 
Greenhills, Mandaluyong, 

7. Gabriel Cruz 

president of the Odessa Fishing and Trading Corp, of 
Navotas, Metro Manila, together with Rufino Tiangco, 
majority stockholder and chairman of Odessa, one 
Artemio Tan, and one Rudy Jimenez. He provided a 
fishing vessel of the corporation, the Lady-Vi-T-1, to 
ferry the rebel troops of the 24 IB and the 68 IB

Declaration for a fair market value of 7441,600 is loca- 
ted on this lot. It appears, however, that on 15 Septem-

1989, 64

CHAPTER VI 463 



the 24 IB and 68 IB from the Marsteel wharf at limay, 
Bataan to the waiting vessel, Lady Vi-T-1, 66 

8. Ruben Reyes 

operations coordinator of MGG Marine Services, Inc. 

E. Let Justice Be Done 

Quoting the Explanatory Note of House Bill No. 30233, the 
Commission stated on page 32 of its Interim Report No. 3 thus 

... a coup d'etat is reprehensible because "its key leaders, contrary to their oath 
of office, take undue advantage of their key positions within the establishment 
to overthrow the very government they had pledged to uphold, protect and 
defend In the case of the military, they draw their pay from the government 
and they enjoy the legal monopoly of the gun and other instruments of mass 
violence. In the case of civilian officials, they occupy positions of leadership 
which enable them to usurp the powers of government." 

Because of the failed December 1989 coup, 99 were killed and 570 
were wounded in action; and combined financial losses would be in the 
order of 1*800 million to "PI billion. 

However, as stated in the preceding chapter, loss of lives, loss of 
confidence, and damage to our international image are worth far more 
than the financial losses. 

The basic principles of justice then demand that those responsible 
for the coup answer for the consequences of their acts. 

Accordingly, all military personnel which moved against the 
government in the failed coup of Decerriber 1989 must be prosecuted for 
violations of the appropriate provisions of the Articles ofWar as amended 
(CANo. 408 as amended), such as Articles 67, 68, 84, 94, 96 or 97, and 
should be imposed the commensurate penalty, taking into account the 
following considerations 

(a) whether the personnel was involved in the 
planningxn* plotting of the coup, 

(b) whether the personnel is a repeater, in the sense 
that he was involved in one or more previous coups, 

(c) the extent of the damage inflicted or caused by 
the illegal move, 



464 



(d) the length of time the personnel resisted the 
government forces, and 

(e) in respect to junior officers and the enlisted 
personnel, the defense that they merely followed 
the orders of their commander should not be taken 
at face value and, where the movement of the unit 
appeared to be clearly illegal from the beginning, 
such as the attack on Malacaflang or Camp 
Aguinaldo, or where such movement to another 
zone or area followed an attack of a camp and at a 
time when the coup was already known, such a ' 
defense should not be accepted. To illustrate, 
troops of the MBLT 4 which left Fort Bonifacio to 
attack Villamor Air Base (VAB) in the midnight of 
30 November 1989 and who, after taking control of 
VAB, proceeded to attack Camp Aguinaldo or the 
PTV-4 complex should not be heard to plead 
innocence on the theory that they merely followed 
the orders of their commanders. The same rule 
should apply to rebels who did not offer to surrender 
even if they already knew that their movements 
were unauthorized and were directed against the 
government. The same rule should apply to the 
Rangers who went to Makati after having the 
opportunity to surrender in the morning of 2 
December. 

As to civilians against whom the Commission finds reasonable 
ground to believe that they are probably liable for offenses in connection 
with the failed coup, or those whom the Commission endorses for further 
investigation, the latter recommends to the Department of Justice their 
immediate investigation and prosecution should the requisite quantum 
of evidence be gathered. The evidence already obtained by the Commis- 
sion against them would, pursuant to Section 1 (c) of RA No. 6832, be 
turned over to the Department.

VII 

CAUSES, ANALYSIS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS 



The Fact-Finding Commission was tasked to inquire into the who 
(participants), why (causes), and how (events) of the December 1989 
coup attempt and to make recommendations to prevent its recurrence. 
The narration of events is contained in Chapter V and the Commission's 
findings on participants in Chapter VI. This Chapter completes the 
Commission's mandated task. 

A The Causes 

Invariably, those who openly admitted participating in the coup or 
are implicated in it offered the following reasons on why the coup 
occurred, which is another way of expressing why they joined the coup: 

1. Failure of the government to deliver basic services especially 
in the rural areas; 1 

2. Graft and corruption; 2 

3. Too much politics and grandstanding of politicians, and unfair 
criticism, even humiliation, at the hands of politicians,* 3 

4. Bureaucratic inefficiency which exacerbates the alienation 
and poverty of the people; 4 

5. Poor and non-responsive military leadership which is manifested 
by a tayo-tayo system, factionalism, and inadequate financial 
and logistical support for the soldier in the field; 6 

6. Lack of genuine reconciliation; 6 

7. Uneven treatment of human rights violations committed by the 
military and the CPP-NPA; 7 



CHAPTER VII 471 



8. Absence of good government; 8 

9. Softness on the CPP-NPA and left-leaning elements; 9 and 

10. Failure of the civilian leadership to effectively address economic 
problems. 10 

The implication of their answers is that the governing body or junta 
to be established by the coup d'etat would correct or solve all these 
deficiencies in the present government 

The rebel witnesses, however, when pressed for a program of 
government were unable to answer exactly how reforms were going to 
be achieved or to name the persons who would implement it. 

A review of the issues raised by the coup plotters in the previous six 
attempts against the Aquino administration also reveals an interesting 
pattern of similar answers with emphasis on the current issues of the 
day. For example, for the Manila Hotel and the "God Save The Queen" 
attempts, the emphasis was softness against communists; in the GMA- 
7 incident, the lack of genuine reconciliation, as exemplified by the 
government refusal to allow Marcos to come home; in August 1987, the 
bickerings in the Cabinet; and in December 1989, graft and corruption 
and congressional shenanigans. 

On the other hand, when officers who fought for the government 
were asked what they thought were the causes of the coup attempt, they 
repeated many of those advanced by the coup participants 11 and, in 
addition, cited: 

1. Obsession with the power which they thought they had won but 
handed over to Corazon C. Aquino in February 1986; 

2. A desire by coup leaders to regain privileges enjoyed during the 
Marcos administration and the prospect of possible power or 
financial gain in the process; 12 

3. Personal grievances and perceived "dead end* in career path; 

4. Strong fraternal or personal ties, with origins dating back to 
PMA days; 13 

5. Naive idealism, particularly on the part of younger officers; 14 



472 



6. A messianic complex. 16 

Despite the attempts of the coup plotters and their sympathizers 
(wittingly or unwittingly) to project themselves as real reformers, the 
rebels had their own hidden agenda even as they rode on valid grievances. 

Many of the grievances cited by the rebels as their reasons for joining 
were, unfortunately, objective realities and, hence, real for those who 
were successfully recruited by reason of their sincere desire, however 
misguided, to help effect reforms in the military establishment and the 
government. That the core group of rebels managed to mask their own 
agenda by invoking these grievances validates the reality of many of the 
shortcomings in the military and the government, and the need to 
address them decisively if future coup attempts are to be deterred. 

i 

There were also coup participants who were impelled by personal 
motives, and others by institutional factors. There were, in effect, 
several levels of motivation. The Commission classifies the rebels 
according to motives with examples which, however, are not exhaustive: 

1. For the inner circle of the RAM splinter group or RAM-HF and 
its recruits (since the original composition and tendencies have 
changed) — a continuation of their original plan in 1986 to take 
power for themselves which evolved from a desire for reform 
initially within the military (i.e., Honasan, Batac, Kapunan, 
Turingan, Lucas, Legaspi, Malajacan, Aguinaldo, Purugganan); 

2. For the Marcos-Ver Loyalist forces (Loyalist) — to regain the 
power and privileges enjoyed during the Marcos regime or to 
repay past favors (utang na loob) by honoring a "commitment* 
to help when called upon (i.e., Zumel, Tecson, Oliveros, Pizarro, 
Gojo); 

3. For high ranking military officials — ambition which cannot be 
realized within the existing chain of command (i.e., Comendador, 
Abenina, Calajate); f * 

4. For some senior officers and many junior officers — deference to 
peers, superiors, or a mistahs w , and pakikisama (de la Pefia, 
Cahmag, Panelo); the attraction and excitement of a conspiracy 
that promises windfall gains in power and career opportunities

causes (i.e. Gregory Ramos, Tomas, Ong). 

Why did the December 1989 coup attempt happen? 

Filipinos want change — some to the extent of "any change" in the 
belief that it can only be better than the present, at least for themselves. 
This pervading sentiment in Philippine society can easily be mistaken 
for support by the impatient or the ambitious. In the case of the military, 
as discussed in Chapters II and III, crossing the dividing line between 
being politicalized (awareness of societal problems) and politicized 
(taking power for themselves) can easily be rationalized, especially by 
the well-meaning. 

This clamor for change is not solely a product of the EDSA Revolt. 
That would be an incomplete perspective of history. The EDSA Revolt 
is a convenient point of reference because it was a dramatic event that 
capsulized a long struggle for a new order of morality, economic progress, 
social justice, and enlightened leadership. - 

In this context, the shortcomings of the Aquino government cannot 
be the root cause of the coup. As pointed out in Chapter III, the political 
achievements and economic performance of the Aquino government, at 
least up to the December 1989 attempt, compare favorably with past 
regimes in the country and those of other countries in the region. 
However, the Aquino government could be faulted for failing to live up 
to the promise of its glorious beginnings. 

Despite the genuine achievements of the EDSA Revolt and of the 
three years prior to December 1989, the country continued to experience 
structural tensions in the social fabric that called for more than piecemeal 
solutions. 

Thus, the December 1989 attempt, as well as the other six attempts 
against the Aquino administration, happened as a result of a propitious 
conjuncture of motive, circumstance, and perceived opportunity. 

1. There was a group of officers which enjoyed high credibility 
within the ranks of the military because of their service records 
and their cultivated reputation as reformists even during the 



474 



Marcos regime, and the perception within the military that they 
caused the Aquino government to improve the lot of the soldier, 

2. This group of officers, highly politicized by the transformation, 
in general, of the military over the years (see Chapter II) and the 
group's special status during the Marcos regime, decided to grab 
power for themselves, representing that they could do better 
than civilians in governing the country. 

3. They thought that it was a good time to launch the coup because 

of the declining popularity of the Aquino government and the 
reality of many of the issues being raised by media and various 
interest groups, and because the country was undergoing the 
difficult process of transition to a newly-restored democracy 
with structural and institutional weaknesses and a complex set 
of difficult problems. 

The question may well be asked, if the clamor for change is so strong 
and the elements for success appeared to be present, why did the 
December attempt fail and turn out to be unpopular? 

Because the people were not disposed to it, as they were for the EDSA 
Revolt. The December 1989 coup attempt was perceived as an attack on 
democracy, the EDSA Revolt as a return to it. Surveys showed that the 
unpopularity of the December 1989 attempt is not as much a reflection 
of high satisfaction at the performance of government as a natural 
aversion against violent and illegitimate means to effect change. The 
Filipino is essentially conservative and patient, and considers elec- 
toral change as a valid democratic exercise despite its imperfections. 
Furthermore, the motives of the coup participants were suspect. After 
all, they themselves acknowledged the electoral victory of President 
Aquino in 1986. The tactical alliance between the RAM-HF and the 
Loyalists that became public knowledge for the first time during the 
coup, although traceable to earlier signs of collaboration, contributed to 
the distrust. Finally, the economic indicators by December 1989 were 
positive compared to the severe recession prior to February 1986. 

However, popular support is not a precondition for the success of a 
coup, only for the sustain ability of the resulting dispensation. Sometimes, 
not even for that purpose, if the military regime is willing to resort to the 
indiscriminate use of force and violence to maintain itself. That the 
December 1989 attempt turned out to be unpopular was not the reason 
for its failure. Its failure was a combination of genuine heroism on the 
part of some government forces, tactical mistakes by the coup plotters 



CHAPTER VII 475 



and the hesitancy of key rebel figures (i.e., Blando), timely intervention 
of military-civilian forces particularly at gateway roads to Metro Manila, 
and failure of the rebels to elicit a bandwagon effect from mqjor military 
units in the country. 

ft Analysis 

B.l. The Context 

Transitions are never easy. Political transitions from dictatorship 
to democracy are especially difficult because democratic processes are 
usually slow, cumbersome and diverted by the noisy. They involve 
competing interests of diverse groups, unequal in influence, which have 
to be harmonized for policy to emerge. There is also the resistance, if not 
deliberate obstruction, by vested interests and well-entrenched power 
blocs to any change that would reduce their privileged positions in the 
system. 

Favored business elites, political leaders of the old regime, and 
military groups that propped it up and were handsomely rewarded in 
exchange are the natural opponents of democratization. Unfortunately, 
the weakness of political institutions inherent in the transition process 
limits their capacity to neutralize these opponents of desirable change. 

If the dictatorship left a path of plunder and economic devastation, 
the problems of transition become exacerbated. Inherited economic 
problems cannot be solved overnight. Democratic space can become an 
open arena for unbridled, even violent political contestation where 
government is expected to uphold individual democratic rights, while it 
fights for its very survival. Among the poor and hungry, democracy 
provides a weak rallying point for political unity with and support for 
the political leadership. In the face of perceived government weaknesses, 
Public alienation, or even indifference, those who wish to recapture their 
lost positions of privilege may engage in military adventurism. 

The series of coup attempts against the Aquino government can be 
in this light. 

&2. Reaping the Whirlwind 

The destruction of political institutions and processes during the 
Marcos dictatorship and the resulting military role expansion beyond 
*Anae and security and law and order provided the environment for the 
Politicization of a significant number of officers in the Armed Forces of 



476 ^ 

"• - -i V, 

the Philippines (AFP). The supremacy of civilian authority over the 
military, secured by various institutional controls, was transformed 
into one secured primarily by the person of Marcos. 

Even that control was breached and weakened by the political 
rivalry between the Ver (former Chief of Staff Gen Fabian Ver) and 
Enrile (former Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile) factions within the 
military during the last few years of the dictatorship. The failed coup 
attempt of February 1986 which was overtaken by the EDSA Revolt was 
the logical consequence of that rivalry. And because civilian control over 
the military was personal, when Marcos was removed, it exposed the 
political system to the peril of autonomous military adventurism, since 
institutionalized civilian control would take time to rebuild. 

The ascension of a woman Commander-in-Chief for the first time in 
the country's history must have required a major adjustment in the 
operational and psychological world of the military, particularly since 
her style of leadership is a marked contrast to that of Marcos. The 
military's perception of a woman leader is graphically portrayed in a 
remark made by a retired officer when asked by the Commission 
whether a woman Secretary of National Defense would be acceptable to 
the AFP. He said the reaction of the military would probably be: "What? 
Another woman again?" 16 But apart from being a woman, the military 
only knew her as the wife of Ninoy Aquino, a political prisoner who was 
later assassinated while under military custody. Perhaps the military 
could not believe that she could forgive and forget her husband's 
assassination for which members of the military were under prosecution, 
some of whom have been recently convicted. Somehow this background 
must have been a hindrance in forging an easier or more comfortable 
relationship between the Commander-in-Chief and the military she led. 

The institutionalization of non-military functions for the AFP, 
seriously begun in 1966, facilitated the politicalization of officers as 
they acquired non-military skills from civilian graduate schools and 
exposed them to wider civilian public and socio-economic-political 
situations. In some cases, military officers became wielders of tremen- 
dous economic and political power, in addition to their original organized 
armed power. 



The exigencies of dictatorial rule led to the erosion of the professional 
values of achievement and merit in promotions and assignments. They 
were replaced by the primary criterion of personal loyalty to the civilian 
and mihtary leadership especially as popular dissent grew. Initially, 
this criterion seemed to have been a m^jor consideration in the post 



CHAPTER VII 477 



EDSA period for the simple reason that the military President Aquino 
inherited was the same military that Marcos used in order to maintain 
his rule and which he coddled in return. Given the persistent coup 
attempts since July 1986 , the officers' loyalty not only to the Constitution 
but also to the duly constituted authority was necessary if the consti- 
tutional order were to have a chance of surviving. Unfortunately, this 
had been perceived as a return to the old system. Hence, the complaint 
about the tayo-tayo and bata-bata systems by rebel military officers. 

The persistence of this tendency is part of the Marcos legacy to the 
military, one that will take time to repair. The failed December 1989 
coup indicated that even personal pledges of loyalty given to superior 
officers are no guarantee against participation in a coup. The case of 
BGen Marcelo Blando is one classic example. He pledged loyalty to AFP 
Chief of Staff Gen Renato de Villa even as the coup attempt was already 
underway. In the end, his commitment to the coup plotters prevailed, 
although his hesitation, presumably because of de Villa's repeated calls, 
might have been a fatal setback for the rebels since several units 
appeared to have been half-hearted while waitingfor him to order or lead 
them. 

The objective socio-economic-political environment was merely an 
excuse for military adventurism. As noted in Chapter III, the performance 
of the economy was positive and various indicators suggested some 
improvements in welfare. Even the soldier's pay and other benefits have 
been significantly improved since 1986. 17 The military also continued 
to have a significant share in policy-making in areas related to its role. 
Even if there was a perception of weakness in the political leadership, 
this was not a sufficient reason for launching a coup. The failed coup 
attempt in December 1989, and even previous ones, was greatly influenced 
by the misperception among politicized officers that President Aquino 
owed her position to the original Reform the Armed Forces Movement 
(RAM) of which ex-Lt Col Gregorio Honasan's faction (RAM-HF) is a 
splinter. This misperception was reinforced by media adulation after 
the EDSA Revolt, painting Honasan and his group as larger-than-life 
heroes, thereby muting the unseemly aspects of their careers. 

The Commission received testimony that during their heyday at 
the Ministry of National Defense (MND), Honasan would call senior 
officers to his office, in obvious disregard of seniority and hierarchy 
norms. The fact that it was people power that installed President 
Aquino is a reality yet to be accepted by the RAM-HF and their civilian 
supporters. As former Undersecretary of National Defense Jose M. 
Crisol said, they have to be disabused of this misperception. Cnsol added 



478 



that "Cory was the soul and spirit of the EDS A Revolution," and that 
even if Commission on Elections (COMELEC) Chairman Ramon Felipe 
was right in saying that there was no evidence she won the elections, the 
overwhelming ratification of the 1987 Constitution legitimized her 
rule. 18 

Supremacy of civilian authority over the military is the overriding 
principle governing the relations between the civilian government and 
the military under the new Constitution. The contraction of the military's 
role aimed at returning the soldiers to the barracks has not been possible 
after February 1986 because of the persistence of the twin communist 
and Muslim insurgencies which, though unsolvable through military 
means, nevertheless require a response with a strong and large military 
component. In some areas of the countryside, the weakness of the 
civilian bureaucracy and local governments continues to devolve civilian 
responsibilities to the military. Thus, the AFFs socio-economic functions 
continue to be discharged by soldiers, even in the stages of the counter- 
insurgency program assigned to the civilian government. Young rebel 
officers decry this situation as it forces them to spread their scarce 
resources too thinly. It is also unwise to use the military for this purpose 
as their extended exposure to local conditions tends to politicize them. 

From the RAM side, it appears that their misperception about the 
EDSA Revolt led some of them to assume a role of guardian of the 
national interest, the country's gatekeeper to Malacanang as it were, in 
their mistaken belief that they are the arbiters of issues on legitimacy. 
This is reflected in their somewhat naive but presumptuous question, 
"Why was it right then and wrong now?,* referring to the EDSA Revolt 
and their post-EDSA coup attempts. Because they mistakenly thought 
that their failed coup attempt against Marcos succeeded in the wake of 
people power, they expected an equal sharing of power with President 
Aquino. Thus, they objected to the release of political prisoners, the 
ceasefire and peace talks with communist and Muslim insurgents, and 
complained about what they believed were left-leaning members of the 
Cabinet. Military socialization into the ideology of anti-communism did 
not help ease their perception that President Aquino was too soft on the 
communists. 

An unfortunate post-EDSA development was the ascendance to 
power of persons who faced the military across the barricades or who 
defended victims of political and military repression during the 
dictatorship. They brought with them anti-military sentiments and 
biases which, given the factors discussed above, probably foreclosed any 



CHAPTER VII 479 



possibility of early reconciliation between the new government and 
specific sectors in the military. 

B.3. If At First You Don't Succeed. . . 



Enrile and the RAM-HF apparently did not give up their original 
coup intentions even after the EDSA Revolt and President Aquino had 
assumed office. He formed an elite group, a battalion purportedly 
organized to counter hijacking and other terrorist activities, in his 
capacity as chairman of the National Committee on Anti-Hijacking 
(NACAH). Honasan headed the group. Although it aroused the sus- 
picion of several high-ranking officers, nothing was done about it until 
after November 1986. He also recommended to the newly-installed 
President Aquino the designation of his trusted aide, Col Tirso Gador, to 
head the Presidential Security Command (PSC). 

At first glance, the RAM-HF and the Loyalists seemed to be natural 
enemies whose coming together could materialize only out of desperation. 
However, contrary to this view, the December 1989 coup attempt may 
have been simply the culmination of a reconciliation process which 
started soon after the EDSA Revolt. The Manila Hotel incident of July 
1986, perpetrated by Loyalists in and out of the military, was allegedly 
known to some members of the RAM-HF before it actually took place 
but the information was not passed on to the government or the AFF 
leadership. As noted in Chapter IV, Lt Col Eduardo Kapunan Jr 
reportedly informed a correspondent about it at least six hours betore 
the event. In fact, both President Aquino and the then Chief of Start, <oen 
Fidel Ramos flew to Cagayan de Oro City, leaving the Executive 
Secretary (Joker Arroyo) and the Vice Chief of Staff (Lt Gen Salvador 
Mison) in charge of Malacanang and the AFP, respectively. 

Having known of it in advance, it might be surmised that the RAM- 
HF intentionally kept the information to itself and couldhave welcomed 
it as a barometer of popular sentiment, i.e., if enough people rallied 
around the incident and a critical mass reached, they would have taken 
it over, come out on top, and subsequently obtained control of the 
government. The RAM-HF was also in the thick of negotiations between 
the Loyalists and the government during the incident Its tw °^ r8 ' 
Honasan and Kapunan, extricated loyalist officers like Cols Rokndo 
AbadillaandDictador Arquiza, and Maj Reynaldo Cabauatan .from the 
Manila Hotel on 8 July one hour ahead of the ^.^f™ 
DefenseMinister Enrile pre-empted both President Aquino ^ mos 
in negotiating a settlement of the incident with the loyalist rebels even 



480 



before the two returned from Cagayan de Oro City to Manila. Enrile 
came out looking good in the eyes of the Loyalists for the lenienqr with 
which they were treated. 

Such leniency set the tone for government handling of subsequent 
coup attempts. The rationale that the rebels did not fire a single shot 
and that there were no casualties from the incident became the standard 
yardstick for determining the extent of punishment for military adven- 
turism. Leniency, however, tended to encourage, rather than deter, 
participation in subsequent coup attempts. As the military is socialized 
into its own system of reward and punishment to instill discipline, 
leniency only encourages undisciplined behavior among officers. A 
related question is one of amnesty for the rebel military. The gravity of 
their act lies in the fact that they are armed by the state and have taken 
a solemn oath to defend the Constitution and duly constituted authority. 
A coup attempt is nothing short of treason and the principals involved 
should not be treated lightly. 

The "God Save The Queen" plot of November 1986 was potentially 
the most dangerous because, as narrated in Chapter IV, it could have 
been a chain-of-command coup and, in all probability, would have 
succeeded if Gen Ramos and his major service commanders had agreed 
to the coup overtures of the RAM-HF and Enrile. Despite the adroit 
management of the situation by Gen Ramos and the major service 
commanders, Army Commanding General Canieso, Air Force Chief 
Sotelo, Naval Chief Jardiniano, and Constabulary Chief de Villa, and 
their refusal to join, the RAM-HF nevertheless attempted to launch the 
"God Save The Queen" plot and to wrest power from President Aquino. 
Interestingly, Marcos's KBL (Kilusang Bagong Lipunan) politicians 
were to have cooperated in the attempt by taking over the Batasang 
Pambansa and convening a rebel parliament, while RAM-HF took 
control of strategic targets. The attempt fizzled out without any shot 
being fired and without any casualty but for Enrile whom President 
Aquino unequivocally and decisively removed from the Cabinet. Unfor- 
tunately, Honasan and company were allowed to go free and none of 
them was even formally investigated. While subsequent coup attempts 
after November 1986 and before August 1987 had Loyalist forces as the 
main plotters and participants, the involvement of Honasan Guardians, 
who constitute a small segment of the total membership, suggests that 
a collaboration between the RAM-HF and the Loyalist forces must have 
already been taking shape. Moreover, Honasan interceded with Gen 
Ramos on behalf of the loyalist rebels who took over GMA-7 in January 
1987 on the pretext that any drastic action would divide the AFP. On 
hindsight, it is likely that he was even then protecting potential allies. 



CHAPTER VII 481 



Honasan signed as witness to the Articles of Incorporation of the 
Guardian Brotherhood, Inc. (GBI) and was the principal incorporator of 
the Guardian Centre Foundation, Inc. (GCFI). The latter was supposed 
to be a civilian-military group aimed at supporting the AFP. 

In the Black Saturday mutiny of April 1987, both Loyalist forces and 
the Guardians were again involved A collaboration may have also been 
arranged for the August 1987 coup attempt which is generally thought 
to be a RAM-HF conspiracy. Msg Cabauatan, who was one of the leaders 
of the Manila Hotel incident, the January 1987, and April 1987 coup 
attempts, was reportedly at the rebels' staging point at the Valle Verde 
Lodge in San Fernando, Pampanga during the attempt. 

From the above, it may be concluded that the RAM-HF and the 
Loyalists, as the two principal military rebel groups continuously 
plotting against the Aquino government, must have started to develop 
collaborative ties as early as July 1986 which culminated in their joint 
launching of the December 1989 coup attempt. The same principals 
appear again and again as far back as February 1986: Enrile and the 
RAM-HF, primarily Honasan, Kapunan, Lt Col Victor Batac, ex-Navy 
Capt Felix Turingan, ex-Lt Col Oscar Legaspi, ex-LCdr Jaime Lucas, 
among others; and the Loyalists led by Zumel with Cabauatan, Abadilla, 
and others. The latter two were absent in the December 1989 failed coup. 
Cabauatan was in jail, while Abadilla had become the Vice Governor of 
Ilocos Norte. 

The December 1989 coup attempt was the biggest as both factions 
were able to activate old ties and loyalties, as well as draft new recruits 
from disgruntled or idealistic officers. It appears from data in Chapter 
VI that the bulk of the rebel officers came from the PMA, in spite of the 
fact that from 75 to 80 percent of the AFP officer corps are non-PMA 
sourced. Old ties forged at the PMA appear to have been activated for 
the December 1989 failed coup. They might also have called in all their 
"chips" in the process and seriously depleted their resources. Among the 
disgruntled or idealistic officers could be the Young Officers Union 
(YOU), which could be a genuine splinter of the RAM-HF. In the same 
way that generational and leadership gaps gave birth to the CPP/NPA 
(Communist Party of the Philippines/New Peoples 7 Army) within the old 
communist movement and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) 
sprang from the original Mindanao Independence Movement (not 
Canoy's), controlled by older Muslim politicians, YOU could be an 
attempt to distance younger generation officers from their elders, many 
of whom could have been tainted by close association with powerful 
politicians in the previous regime. Seeking change possibly for reasons 



different from their elders, these idealistic officers became easy 
recruits into the plot 

It must also be pointed out that factionalism exists in the AFP. Aa 
long as this is denied, it cannot be addressed. As the resources and the 
time of the Commission are limited, it could not look into this problem 
as thoroughly as required to recommend remedial measures. Together 
with grievances like the bata-bata system, anomalies in procurement 
and supplies, graft and corruption of senior officers, inadequate attention 
to the needs of the soldiers in the field, and others, factionalism must 
be studied in order to find their solutions. By doing so, the military, 
especially its politicalized members would realize that governmentisnot 
insensitive to their grievances, that government cares enough to attend 
to the legitimate causes of the virus that has led some of them to conspire 
against the government, and that it is sympathetic to meaningful 
reforms. 

B.4. A Fatal Miscalculation 

Some people find what they hope to see in a situation. The rebels saw 
a psy chomilieu they thought favorable to their interventionist enterprise, 
The polls indicated a decline of government popularity particularly that 
of President Aquino who started her presidency with an exceptionally 
high popularity rating. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives, 
already scoring low, scored even lower in the polls immediately preceding 
the December 1989 coup attempt. The rebels musthave interpreted this 
as a propitious time to unseat President Aquino, expecting if not the 
support of the population at least their indifference or neutrality. They 
failed to understand that popular dissatisfaction is one thing, supporting 
an unconstitutional means of changing political leaders is another. 

The scandals splashed in media involving government officials or 
institutions such as the much-publicized Garchitorena landscam, car 
and gun importations by members of Congress, gun smuggling by one 
Congressman, the "sexcapades" in the Senate, to name a few, were focal 
points for government critics and the opposition to attack the government 
This influenced the perceptions of the rebels. While they often complain 
about graft and corruption, very few were able to cite specific cases. 
Instead, they name the media as their source of information. 19 the 
scandals provided the rebels with an excuse to intervene in political 
affairs purportedly to put a halt to these perceived anomalies in 
government. They provided the proverbial fuel for the fires of rebellion 
already ignited by rebel leaders and recruiters. 



CHAPTER VII 4g3 



Metro Manila's problems of power outages and inadequate public 
transport on its congested and pock-marked roads must have been 
generalized for the entire country and compounded their knowledge of 
the breakdown of the delivery of basic services in the countryside. The 
polls also indicated reduced optimism as to the people's perceptions 
about their economic prospects. 20 

In addition, perceived unjustified attacks against some officers by 
politicians, especially relating to the confirmation of promotions and the 
PC- PNPbill, provided another source of grievance among some members 
of the military. In Cebu, the December 1989 coup attempt was preceded 
by discussions against the PC-PNP bill and could have been used as a 
venue for proselytization by Lt Col Tiburcio Fusilero. It may be recalled 
that several military officers based there behaved suspiciously before 
and during the coup attempt. They have been recommended for further 
investigation by the Commission in its Resolution No. 059 dated 17 April 
1990 and are so classified in Chapter VI of this Report. 

The plotters must have been hoping to see another EDSA Revolt in 
subsequent plots. This is evidenced by their attempts to organize a 
civilian component to shield the military rebels from government troops. 
The civilian Marcos loyalists provided this function during the Manila 
Hotel incident and the GMA 7 takeover. They must have seen the 
potential for mass civilian support against the government in the 
reduced satisfaction ratings for government, ^lleged anomalies in 
government as widely publicized by media, and the reported failure to 
deliver basic services not only in the countryside but also in Metro 
Manila. Their miscalculation was fatal as Filipinos overwhelmingly 
rejected the coup attempt in various polls conducted nationwide after 
the failed coup. About 82 percent did not approve of the coup even as 30 
percent agreed with many of the rebels' grievances. 21 

In fact, many civilians did more than just condemn the coup in 
opinion surveys. Despite the generally poor communication between the 
central and local government, 22 civilians coordinated in their communities 
with the military in Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Muntinlupa, Quezon City, 
Camarines Sur, and other places to stop rebel troops while allowing 
those considered friendly to pass through. Special mention must also be 
£ade of the management and technicians of ABS-CBN, PTV-4, and 
GMA-7, who had the presence of mind and the courage to disable the 
broadcast facilities and thereby prevent the rebels from using TV and 
ttdiofor propaganda. And, of course, the Philippine Red Cross volunteers 
wrote their own passages of heroism in the nation's history. Filipinos 
^questionably wanted to give democracy and the Constitution a chance. 



484 



BJ>. Financing the Coup Attempt 

In accordance with Sec (d) of RA No. 6832 and the Commission's 
Rules and Regulations (Resolution No. 004), the Commission applied 
with the Monetary Board of the Central Bank to inspect the bank 
accounts of several civilian and military persons, including the much 
publicized US$ 100,000 allegedly deposited by the wife of a high ranking 
rebel officer, to determine whether there were any evidence that these 
individuals either financed or received money in connection with the 
failed 1989 December coup. The Commission in the course of its 
investigation examined accounts in no less than eight commercial 
banks. In each instance, the Commission found no evidence directly 
linking the accounts with the attempted coup. 

Moreover, Central Bank Governor Jose L. Cuisia, by letter, confirmed 
to the Commission that there were no unusual withdrawals from foreign 
currency deposits during the period immediately preceding the soup 
attempt. 

On the other hand, the Commission is not surprised by its findings 
regarding the possible use of bank accounts in the last attempted coup. 
It is reasonable to suppose that the conspirators and supporters of the 
attempted coup would not be so reckless as to use the commercial 
banking system to funnel funds to the rebels, and thus create an audit 
trail government prosecutors can trace. Also, it should be noted v that the 
rebels utilized equipment, arms, vehicles, aircrafts, armor apd, of 
course, personnel supplied by and paid for by the government. Thereis 
also no conclusive evidence that large amounts of money of the magnitudes 
initially talked about (up to $50 million or T 1 billion) was a nuyorfactor 
or consideration in launching the coup. 

Nevertheless, the Commission is of the opinion that some money was 
distributed which was generated for the rebels mainly from local sources, 
particularly from those individuals and firms in whose interest it is to 
destabilize the government. 

There is some evidence of money being held or distributed by the 
coup plotters. The nocturnal activities of Col Alexander Noble, Lt Col 
Victor Batac, and ex-Lt Col Billy Bibit in Heroes Hills, Quezon City and 
in Room 1701 of Holiday Inn, those of Lt Col Tiburcio Pusilero in Cebu 
City, the undocumented source of some 1*200,000 deposited by LtCol 
Arsenio Tecson's wife on 5 December 1989 at a Cubao branch of a bank, 
and the Galido expose on Luis Tabuena and Cherry Cobarrubias indicate 
that cash may have been provided to the coup conspirators. BGenJose 



CHAPTER VII 485 



Comendador was reportedly overheard requesting over the telephone 
a cash donation allegedly from a company in Cebu City, in order to avoid 
being accosted at the government checkpoints. 23 Customs Commissioner 
Mison also said that he heard about a high ranking officer's wife 
supposedly receiving a check for 1*500,000, some company commanders 
being offered 1*20,000 and some generals between Tl million and T2 
million if they would join the plot. 24 Offers of private contribution, such 
as the one made to Navy Capt ReJ^Robles by a Chinese businessman, or 
solicitation by some Makati-based professionals, must have also been 
one source of the attempted coup's funding. 

Based on the testimonies it received, the Commission also believes 
that suspected coup plotters had their own "independent" sources of 
income. Capt Leovic Dioneda's family reportedly controlled jueteng 
operations in Sorsogon. Maj Abraham Purugganan allegedly had an 
independent source of income from gold-panning operations in Mt 
Diwalwal in Davao when he was assigned there. 25 Col Noble is known 
to have been in the payroll of loggers. According to businessman Cesar 
Magsaysay, a friend of Fusilero, Noble receives "allowances" from 
Agusan loggers. In fact, among the documents recovered from his 
get-away car at the checkpoint in Sta Rita, Samar was a receipt 
for 1*5,000.00 by Noble from one Bernie Manpatila. The latter is a 
brother of the deceased leader of the Higaonon tribe who was Noble's 
friend. Magsaysay, however, denies that his own Butuan Logs gives 
Noble a similar "allowance". Bibit's sources of independent income was 
the Bureau of Customs whose reputation as a lucrative source of graft 
money is well-known. However, among the alleged plotters, Rodolfo 
Aguinaldo's sources of such income are perhaps the biggest — he 
allegedly controlled illegal logging, illegal gambling, and the Small 
Town Lottery (STL) in Cagayan. Thus, he was able to buy, it is said, the 
loyalty of Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Units (CAFGUs) and 
even military officers based in that province. 26 

Cash was used to pay for the fishing vessel chartered by the 
mysterious Artemio Tan who allegedly claimed to be a businessman 
from Puerto Princesa, Palawan. The vessel, Lady Vi-T-1, broughtLtCol 
Arsenio Tecson's 68 IB and Maj Alfredo Oliveros's 24 IB from Bataan to 
Sangley and back. It is owned by Odessa Fishing and Trading Corpo- 
ration of Navotas, Metro Manila. Curiously, Odessa's Board Chairman, 
Rufino Tiangco, admitted being a close friend of Romeo (Romy) Rivera 
and a business associate of Honasan's brother, Don. 

Almost from the beginning of the Commission's investigation, this 
vessel has been a major object of interest for the simple reason that 



1UU 



nobody at Bataan, Sangley or Naval District II (ND II) seemed to have 
been able to either take a good look at it to be able to describe it, or tofyave 
found it after it ferried the rebel troops back to Bataan. Yet it reportedly 
carried about 800 troops. The Commission's finding the vessel was 
nothing short of serendipitous. In the process, another possible connection 
between conspirators was unearthed. The main actors in the charter of 
this vessel are linked through Honasan. 

It will be recalled that Rivera was already implicated in the failed 
December coup. Arms, ammunition, and communications equipment 
were found by the military in his house after the coup attempt Rivera 
is the incumbent President of the Philippine Rifle and Shotgun Association 
where Jackie Enrile is chairman. A friend of Honasan's since 1979* 
Rivera is the godfather of one of Honasan's children. In turn, Honasan 
is godfather to one of Rivera's children. 27 According to Tiangco, Rivera 
introduced him to Honasan and his brother, Don, at a stag party Rivera 
tendered in Don's honor three years ago. Since then Tiangco and Don 
had been engaged in business, with Don supplying Odessa's cement 
needs. 

The suspicious nature of the charter, the equally suspicious behavior 
of Odessa's owners, and their personal relationship with the Honasans 
and persons close to them as described in Chapter V, may lead one to 
conclude that the said charter was fictitious and that the fishing vessel 
could very well be Tiangco's contribution to Don's brother's adventurism. 
Don was allegedly also involved in the "God Save the Queen" plot. His 
car was intercepted in Camp Aguinaldo by Commo VirgilioMarcelo filled 
with firearms which the latter confiscated. They included Galil and 
Ultimax weapons loaded in three Land Cruisers in addition to Don's car. 
They were later released presumably to Honasan. 28 A person who closely 
resembles Don Honasan was also seen on television tape among the 
rebels in the vicinity of the Domestic Airport during the December 1989 
coup attempt by a CIS (Constabulary Intelligence Service) agent in the 
presence of one of the members of the Commission. 

Cash was similarly used to pay for another mysterious charter, this 
time of an aircraft, by one Roberto Huang some ten days before the failed 
coup of December 1989. Curiously, the aircraft belongs to the Executive 
and Tourist Aviation owned by Chemical Industries of the Philippines, 
Inc., one of whose owners is known to have had close links with Marcos. 
The funds were allegedly sent by couriers from one Oliver Ker of Kota 
Kinabalu to Huang who paid the charter in cash and kept the remainder. 
Ker was connected with Jayapuri Brunei, Ltd. 29 



CHAPTER VII 437 



As discussed in Chapter V, this mysterious charter, it seems, was 
timed to have been in Davao when Eduardo (Danding) Cojuangco Jr 
reportedly took offfrom a private airstrip at Malita, Davao del Sur using 
another aircraft. Had they wanted to, it would have been possible 
according to Capt Adriano Morales, for the chartered aircraft to have 
flown into Malita from Kota Kinabalu and then proceeded to Davao 
City Airport to formally record its re-entry into the Philippines with 
Immigration and Customs authorities. 

The use of the aircraft and the fishing vessel could represent 
contributions of their owners to the coup plotters. One need not contri- 
bute funds to support the coup attempt. There were testimonies received 
by the Commission that civilians sent food to the rebels holed out in 
various buildings in Makati during the siege there. In fact, the rebels 
themselves agreed to take food and other supplies from Rustan 
Commercial Corporation in the Makati Commercial Center allegedly 
in exchange for sparing the building from being used as a machine gun 
nest. 30 

In the end, it is apparent that most of the resources used by the coup 
plotters were from the government. Arms, ammunition, equipment, and 
supplies such as those issued to the units that moved against the 
government, those raided from government armories, and goods from 
the warehouse of the Bureau of Customs were among the principal 
resources from the government employed against its duly constituted 
authority by those who were supposed to defend it. The cash allegedly 
found on wounded rebels could have been their month's end salary 
received on 29 November since 30 November was a holiday. Even the 
initial reports about long lines of soldiers making big deposits in Makati 
banks turned out to be unsubstantiated. 

B.6. Spreading the Coup Virus 

In retrospect, the assignment of politicized officers, some of whom 
were already implicated in previous coup attempts, to sensitive positions 
like operations, intelligence, training, and logistics, was a serious mistake. 
This was demonstrated in the Augulfe 1987 coup attempt when those 
implicated in the November 1986 "God Save The Queen" plot were 
jtonply reassigned instead of being tried and, if found guilty, punished. 
Thjis, they were able to spread with impunity the coup virus in critical 
units to which they were sent. 

Honasan assumed command over the Special Operations School 
®0S) of the PA Training Command (PA TRACOM) inFortMagsaysay, 



488 




Nueva Eqja. The instructors under him included LtEdmundoMalabaqjot, 
Capts Dominador Lina, and Fidel Legiralde. These turned against the 
government on 28 August 1987 bringing with them their trainees. The 
timing of the coup attempt is significant, not only because of the restive 
political environment, but also because Honasan was supposed to 
appear before the AFP Anti-Graft Board on 30 August 1987 to account 
for a substantive number of firearms, radios, vehicles, and aboutP2 
million for the purchase of equipment charged to him while he was 
commander of the elite anti-ten orist battalion at the Defense Ministry. 

Kapunan was reassigned to the PMA after November 1986. Also at 
the PMA were Maj Wilhelm Dew nal and C apt Gregorio Catapang,RAM 
members of long-standing. The latter tried to move to Manila with PMA 
cadets during the August 1987 coup attempt. He was implicated but 
subsequently cleared. Like Honasan, they were able to influence officers 
at the PMA into sympathizing with their movement allegedly against 
anomalies in the military and the government. PMA classes 1988 to 
1991 were infected with the virus and stated their support for the rebels 
during this coup attempt. 

Prior to the December 1989 coup attempt, politicized officers were 
again in control of sensitive positions where they could gather intelligence, 
order troop mobilization and deployment, train military personnel 
whom they would bring with them in unauthorized troop movements, or 
control logistics and supplies. Lt Col Romelino Gojo and Capt DaniloLim 
were their units' operations officers while Cmdr Proceso Maligaligand 
Commo Domingo Calajate were in logistics and supplies. Purugganan 
was commandant of the Officers Candidates School (OCS). They were 
able to operate within their areas of responsibility for the rebel cause 
without inviting suspicion until the crucial hour of the coup attempt's 
launching. Chapter VI discusses the rebel network. 

The dispersal of the First Scout Ranger Regiment (FSRR) after the 
December 1989 coup attempt may nothave been a wise decision asitmay 
only spread the coup virus to a wider area. Units that may not be coup 
prone could be infected by politicized Scout Rangers. It may have been 
more prudent to have put the regiment under a respected commanding 
officer who could reorient the men. Their dispersal could even exacerbate 
anti-government sentiments as Rangers are a very tightly-knit group 
and take pride in their distinction as an effective elite force. Their 
dispersal may be perceived as an unacceptable indignity to their unit 



CHAPTER VII 489 



B.7. Recruitment and Mobilization Factors 



An important recruitment factor seems to be a old boy" networks in 
the AFP. Among older generation officers implicated in the failed 
December 1989 coup, a look at their service records tend to show their 
previous long association with either former Defense Minister Enrile 
or General Ver. Many occupied positions in the Jacinto group of com- 
panies managed by active-duty officers close to Enrile or were with the 
Presidential Security Command/National Intelligence Security Agency 
(PSC/NISA) under Ver. Among the latter are those who were attached 
to embassies or consulates abroad, either as defense attaches or intelli- 
gence officers with innocuous titles not normally found in embassy or 
consulate lists of personnel. These ties were apparently activated for the 
December 1989 coup attempt as we saw officers who were not involved 
in previous coups moving against the government together with well- 
known "repeaters" such as Honasan, Kapunan, Turingan, Batac, Abenina, 
and Zumel. 

Gojo was described as Ver's "side-kick,* 31 having spent more time 
with Ver at the PSC than with the Marines. 32 He is also Honasan's third 
cousin. He reportedly held a grudge against the Aquino government for 
having pulled his younger brother, a pilot, from Manila after the EDSA 
Revolt. His brother was assigned to Mindanao where his aircraft 
crashed. His body was never found. Gojo is said to support his deceased 
brother's family. 33 In Gojo's case, both old ties and personal grudge 
against the government must have led him to join the failed December 
1989 coup. 

Younger officers, not previously implicated surfaced for the first 
time. Lt Emil Ong seems to represent the young idealistic officer, 
indignant over broad social issues like poverty, privileges of the wealthy, 
and injustice of the system. He believes in the goals of reform and 
wished a hastening of the coup plot in order to quickly accomplish the 
implementation of reforms in the military and in the government. 
Other young officers like Capt Gregory Ramos and Lt Oscar ^mgson 
moved out of their barracks to show their sympathy for the rebels, btill 
others who may not have been originally sympathetic to the rebels were 
indignant for what they perceived to be US intervention in Philippine 
domestic affairs. These included the 25 officers who dialogued with 
BGen Mariano Baccay, Jr in Davao City, as well as the 40 who met with 
BGen Rogelio Villanueva in Cagayan de Oro City (See Chapter V and 
VI). Disillusionment with the system, affected by what they perceive as 
continuing problems of poverty and the breakdown of basic services in 
the countryside, graft and corruption in the corridors ot power, 



insurgencies that do not go away, and foreign dependence, among other*, 
must have been compelling reasons for young idealistic officers either to 
join the plot or to show sympathy for the plotters. 

Among the known recruiters who called on their classmates and 
friends were Fusilero and Bibit. Fusilero used his motorcycle gang, the 
Cyclones (short for Cycling Lunatics), as his cover in recruiting allies 
during their trips throughout the country. Bibit undertook his recruitment 
in the Visayas where he comes from, with the gun club, and through his 
Custom's connections. He was reported by BGen Galileo Kintanar of 
ISAFP (Intelligence Service of the AFP) to Commissioner Salvador 
Mison, Bibit's superior at the Bureau of Customs. Col Carlos Tanega 
also called Mison's attention about Bibit's recruitment activities. 
Unfortunately, Mison did not take a personal interest in the matter, 
much less attempt to neutralize him, because Mison felt his "primary 
responsibility is to collect revenues for the government. a . . . I feel that 
thejobof . . . going after these people fighting the government rests solely 
in the hands of the AFP." Mison did ask his chief of intelligence to watch 
Bibit. 36 

Recruitment -seems to have been done rather obliquely, as officers 
said, "pakiramdaman lang muna. n This is why it may be difficult for 
officers to categorically state that they had been approached for 
recruitment into a con spir acy . Overtures usually begin by talking about 
the ills of society and when the recruiter senses that the object of 
recruitment is vulnerable, i.e., dissatisfied with the military and/or 
civilian government, desires cnange or is predisposed towards a coup, 
further discussions are arranged until the object becomes a recruit 

An effective mobilization factor is the political inclination of the 
units' commanding officer. BGen Blando's units were mobilized in large 
numbers, i.e., Tecson's 68 IB, Oliveros's 24 IB, LtColLevyZamora'sSB 
IB, Lt Col Rolen Erasmo's 73 IB, Maj Pedro Gutierrez's 71 IB and the 
company from the Scout Ranger Training Center under Capt Herbert 
Avinante. Blando appeared to be the key factor behind these troop 
movements as their division commander. Although not directly under 
him, the rebel Rangers such as the FSRR HQ, 4 SRB under Lt Col Galvez, 
and 3 SRB under Capt Flores, appeared to look up to him for leadership. 
Because he was expected to fly by helicopter into Fort Bonifacio by the 
Scout Rangers who held that camp, he initially appeared not to join the 
troops of Erasmo, Gutierrez, and Avinante whom he ordered to proceed 
to Camp Aguinaldo. The Sikorsky helicopter flown by Lt Gregor Mendel 
Panelo which landed in the vicinity of Fort Magsaysay at about 1:00 p.m. 
of 1 December must have been the aircraft assigned to bring Blando to 



CHAPTER VII 491 



Fort Bonifacio. When Gen de Villa once more urged him to bring troops 
to Camp Aguinaldo to reinforce it from rebel soldiers, Blando was over- 
heard asking if GHQ (General Headquarters) could provide them with 
air cover. When de Villa answered in the affirmative, Blando must have 
realized that the rebel air assets had been destroyed and decided to go 
to Manila with the above-cited troops by land. He led the convoy from 
Fort Magsaysay not to Camp Aguinaldo but to a "neutral place" — 
Greenhills Commercial Center— where he established his post contrary 
to de Villa's orders. 

There is reason to believe that Tecson and Zamora moved on 
Blando's orders. Tecson asked to be allowed to return to Bataan and 
refused a diversion of his mission to secure Sangley when this was lost 
to the government troops led by Lt Col Edgar Aglipay, Laguna Provincial 
Commander and Lt Col Nicetas Katigbak, Cavite Provincial Commander. 
He said this was the extent of his "commitment" and did not proceed to 
attack the Headquarters of the Western Police District (HWPD) to which 
he was allegedly directed. 37 Zamora, on the other hand, insisted on 
moving towards Manila allegedly on Blando's orders. He agreed to 
return to his post only after learning that Blando had already been 
compromised. It is also possible that the superior force of his classmate, 
Lt Col Efren Fernandez, Pampanga Provincial Commander, made him 
rethink his position. 

The participation of officers closely associated with Ver, like Gojo 
and Navy Capt Danilo Pizarro, seems to have been a function of their 
long association at the PSC/NISA. To some extent, this may similarly 
apply to Tecson and Galvez ( 4 SRB) who were at the PSC during the last 
14 years of Marcos's rule, some of which were spent abroad. 

The deployment of some 26 prison guards and four civilians at the 
instance of Rodolfo Morit, Jr, an incorporator of GCFI, to fight on the 
rebel side is a mobilization through fraternal ties. Guardians have been 
in nearly each coup attempt since July 1986. Morit and Job Gavino, 
Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) Police Station Commander, were 
allegedly the contact persons of this group when it was fetched from the 
New Bilibid Prisons in the evening of 30 November for Ninoy Aquino 
International Airport (NAIA). 38 Interestingly, Gavino was present at 
fte PPA office when rebel soldiers took it over and enticed GCFI 
members from Baguio City to join the coup attempt. 39 Gavino denied 
participation in it. 



Deception may have also been a mobilization factor. Members of the 
GCFI led by Baguio Assistant City Prosecutor Elmer Sagsago were told 



to converge at the North Harbor on 30 November for an alleged GCPI 
meeting. It turned out that the North Harbor PPA office was used as a 
rebel recruitment and mobilization post. The GCFI members were 
invited to join the coup attempt but Sagsago said they instead quietly 
slipped out of the area in two's and three's to escape rebel detection 40 

When the MBLT 4 moved out of Fort Bonifacio into Villamor Air 
Base (VAB), they were told to "follow the tanks" without being told that 
the tanks were going to be used against the government. The 221st PC 
Company under Capt Nestor Bernardino was allegedly brought from 
Taytay on the pretext of going to a counterinsurgency (COIN) operation 
in Binangonan but ended up at the vicinity of PTV-4 on the rebel side. 41 
A similar claim was made by Pfc Victor Samonte, for the Bravo Company 
16 IB based in Mauban, Quezon who was reportedly ordered by LtGener 
del Rosario to go to Magallanes Commercial Center with six others. They 
ended up at VAB where they found their gear and the rest of their 
company. There, del Rosario pointed to their uniforms and guns and told 
them: "Walanatayongpangambadahilnakuhananatinang Villamof, 
They subsequently attacked Camp Aguinaldo. 42 

In spite of the real possibility that enlisted men and others could 
have been deceived into joining the coup attempt, the Commission 
believes that they should have disengaged when they realized the 
deception, instead of remaining on the rebel side. While it is hard to 
distinguish between those who were genuinely deceived, of which there 
were some, and those who claim being deceived, of which there are many, 
deception could be the easiest excuse for joining a misadventure that 
failed. 

B.8. The State of Government Readiness 

V 

The issue of failure of intelligence has been raised in relation to the 
last failed coup. Gen de Villa appeared on television's late news on 30 
November announcing the discovery of the sabotage of the Philippine Air 
Force (PAF) Repeater Station in Tagaytay City. He said the saboteurs 
had been taken into custody and while the act was related to a planned 
coup, the plot had been neutralized. Ironically, however, within thehour 
the rebel Marines moved out of their cantonment area in Fort Bonifacio 
and took over VAB. 

The Commission received evidence that tends to support the view 
that one cause of the government troops' apparent unpreparedness may 
be due to their having become inured to coup rumors and to red alerts 
which, until 1 December 1989, turned out to be unwarranted. As a 



CHAPTER VII 493 



consequence, there was a decline in the times the troops went on red alert 
from 1 September 1987 to 1 December 1989. It is reasonable to assume 
that their psychological readiness necessarily also declined. Dramatic 
declines in red alerts as percentage of days in both the headquarters of 
the Philippine Navy and the Philippine Marines are evidently clear. In 
the Navy, red alerts were called 70 days out of 131 (53.4 percent) in 1987, 
60.04 out of 366 (16.4 percent) in 1988, and only 16.875 out of 333 (5.07 
percent) in 1989. The Marines were on red alert 67 days out of 122 (55 
percent) in 1987, 70.9 out of 366 (19.4 percent) in 1988, and 45.4 out of 
333 (13.6 percent) in 1989. A less dramatic decline is also evident in the 
PAF Headquarters. They went on red alert 47 days out of 122 (38.5 
percent) in 1987, 113outof366 (30.9 percent) in 1988, and 70outof333 
(21 percent) in 1989. 

The soldiers could have become alert-fatigued due to continuing, 
although declining, red alert days. During this time they have to be in 
camp without exception. This must be very difficult for them and their 
families. Persistence of coup rumors that remained rumors must have 
put them in the same psychological state as the victims of "the boy who 
cried wolf. 1 * When the coup plotters finally struck, they appeared 
unprepared. 

There appears to have been failure of intelligence information being 
passed on to the appropriate commander or unit. This is what happened 
in the case of the failure of the Chief of Staff of Regional Command 
(RECOM) 7 to pass on to his superior the information he obtained at 
around 10:00 a an. of 30 November about a coup taking place at 2200 H 
of the same day. The details were not transmitted to the Headquarters 
of the Philippine Constabulary (HPC) whose highest ranking officer 
then was BGen Victor Natividad. This must have been the case, too, of 
themessage simul-patchedby the Flag Officer in Commahd(FOIC) that 
a vessel full of rebel soldiers from Bataan was bound not for Manila as 
alleged by ND II 43 butforSangley. LtCmdrDamian Carlos claimed that 
the message transmitted by FOIC at 10:30 a.m., 30 November was 
received by him only at 3:00 p.m. since he was then at his quarters. 44 If 
it were simul-patched, the staff intelligence officers of all units should 
have received and transmitted it to the commanders of ND II, Philippine 
Coast Guard (PCG), Naval Base Cavite (NBC), and Philippine Fleet 
(PHF). The fact that the vessel reached and left Sangley unmolested 
indicates the failure to either pass the intelligence on to the appropriate 
officers or to use the intelligence properly. 

The failure to use intelligence information properly is best illustrated 
hy the inaction by the AFP on the report of Mfiy Alphonsus Crucero of the 



494 



Negros Island Command (NICOM) about the recruitment activities of 
Bibit and Fusilero. 

It also appears that Malacaflang was not being properly informed 
about intelligence relating to coup attempts. It was left out in the July 
1986 Manila Hotel incident; according to testimony received in Executive 
Session, Malacaflang found out about it from a reporter calling in to 
verify the incident. Malacaflang resorted to buying information from 
those present around Manila Hotel in order to be updated on the 
incident. In the November 1986 "God Save The Queen" plot, Malacaflang 
obtained information from non-military sources and delicately leaked it 
to the press in a manner not traceable to Malacaflang in order to alert 
whoever in the AFP and defense leadership may have been part of the 
plot that Malacaflang was aware of it. More than three years after the 
event, Malacaflang continued to be unaware of its details. 46 

Because of the experience in July 1986, the Bengzon investigating 
committee organized to look into the Manila Hotel incident recommended 
an independent civilian source of intelligence gathering for the 
Commander-in-Chief. Unfortunately, the recommendation Was not 
totally acted upon. Little came out of the creation of a Crisis Committee 
tasked with the responsibility of dealing more effectively with situations 
like a coup attempt. Such a body, in coordination with the Presidents 
own intelligence agency, could have been the appropriate conduit for 
adequate and accurate information both to the President and the public. 
In the absence of such information, the public becomes manipulablety 
misinformation and disinformation unwittingly or deliberately passed 
on by radio and other media. 

The strong camaraderie developed among officers may have been a 
hindrance in securing credible intelligence on coup attempts. Some 
soldiers may not be inclined to pass on information regarding their 
friends or classmates. In fact, some of them testified that it would be 
very difficult for them to arrest classmates or friends like Honasan. 
They would rather that the task is assigned to somebody else. 46 Moreover, 
their socialization into anti-communism taught them that the enemies 
are the communists. Consequently, there has been much better 
intelligence on the CPP/NPA than on the rebel military, according to 
testimony received in Executive Session. Better military and government 
preparedness is necessary to deter future coup attempts or reduce 
further the probability of a successful coup 



CHAPTER VII 495 



B.9. Role of the USAF Phantom Jets 

The capability of the AFP to cope with the rebel assault was put to 
a test when rebel air assets from Sangley attacked Malacaflang and 
government installations in Metro Manila. However, by the time the 
United States Air Force (USAF) jets flew over Metro Manila at 2:04 p.m. 
of 1 December, PAF planes flown by M^j Danilo Atienza, Capt Ariel 
Quijano, and Lt Antonio Avaricio had already destroyed the rebel air 
assets and the fuel dump at Sangley. The Commission's Interim Report 
No. 2 dated 12 May 1990 dealt exhaustively with the chronology of 
events with respect to the USAF jets. 

The Commission concluded that the USAF jets did not destroy the 
rebel air assets nor were they instrumental in keeping the rebel planes 
on the ground to be destroyed by the PAF jets. That issue being settled, 
the Commission also wanted to know the military or political value of the 
so-called persuasion flights, both from hindsight and from the point of 
view of those making the military decisions at the time. 

Gen de Villa contends that, since the tide ofbattle had started to turn 
before noon of 1 December with the arrival of more than sufficient 
reinforcements at Camp Aguinaldo and since the rebel air assets had 
already been destroyed, the flight of the Phantoms served no real 
military value for or against the government forces. This view appears 
to be supported by evidence that several units which intended to support 
the rebels were not deterred from still moving, even after wide publicity 
was given to the flight of the Phantoms, e.g. the 56 IB from Aurora, the 
column of Blando from Fort Magsaysay, the attack by rebel Marines on 
Camp Aguinaldo in the early morning of 3 December. 

On the other hand, the 68 IB and 24 IB that secured Sangley may 
have decided to return to Bataan not only because the rebel air assets 
had already been destroyed but because the persuasion flights were 
made directly over them. 

The Phantoms had a reverse effect on the 25 officers in Davao and 
the 40 in Cagayan de Oro City. They used the flights to express sympathy 
forthe rebels andfaulted the government for alio wingforeign interference 
into a strictly "domestic" affair. 

Ramos' view qualified de Villa's. He said that hindsight tells us that 
toe persuasion flights did occur after the government had already gained 
toe upperhand. However, at the time of the flight, the AFP command 
was not fully certain about the capability of the rebels to launch air 



strikes from Mactan Air Base (MAB) or to bring reinforcements l&m 
Mindanao and Palawan to Manila. It was not until afterwards ffiatifte 
government knew about the refusal of all the pilots to go along with 
Comendador. 

The political value of the flights to the government is questionable. 
The immediate effect to the public was probably one of relief at the 
thought that the US was firmly on the government side, particularly 
after the initial reports of rebel gains. On the other hand, the flints 
served to give the opposition, at least initially, a platform to puttie 
government on the defensive, some young officers an occasion to express 
support for the rebels, and the US and its press a propaganda leverage 
for the bases negotiations. On hindsight, the government would have 
been better off not calling on the persuasion flights. But 20-20 visfon was 
not available when the flights were first agreed upon at about 11:00a.m. 
of 1 December, when a favorable outcome was not yet clearly in sightand 
a judgment call had to be made. That judgment, which paid immediate 
tribute to the US and a belated, but eventually fitting, credit to the PAF 
pilots, may have been the most rational under the circumstances. Butits 
net after-effect is a political setback for the government. It brings home 
the lesson that there is no substitute for self-reliance and the removal of 
all vestiges of overdependence on a foreign patron. 

B.10. Outnumbered But Not Outfought 

Although an officer testified that Commo Domingo Cahyate's turn 
to serve as Senior Command Duty Officer at Camp Aguinaldo on 30 
November could not have been anticipated, 47 the coincidence remains 
rather suspicious. Infiltration from inside Camp Aguinaldo by LOGCOM 
officers, one of whom was the Duty Officer for the day, worked in the 
rebels' favor. The LOGCOM compound occupying two thirds of the camp 
made it easier for Calajate to position his men and to house a Marine 
company from the MBLT 1 as well as a Marine guard company to escort 
supplies for Subic Naval Base from LOGCOM in the evening of 30 
November without inviting suspicion. 

Inside Camp Aguinaldo, the government side was clearly at a dis- 
advantage during the first several hours of the coup attempt BGen 
Rodolfo Biazon, CGNational Capital Region Defense Command (NCRDC), 
said there were not many government troops in Aguinaldo" during this 
time. The troops normally available to him as a maneuver battalion 
were the ones that bolted out of their cantonment area at Fort Bonifacio 
and occupied VAB. 



CHAPTER VII 497 



Fort Bonifacio was quickly overrun by Scout Rangers who had 
filtered earlier into the camp from various points in Northern, Central, 
and Southern Luzon. They took over strategic targets in the camp as the 
MBLT 4 quickly took over VAB. With the same ease, rebels led by ex- 
Lt Col O scar Legaspi, ex -Navy Capt Felix Turingan, and ex-LCdr Jaime 
Lucas occupied Sangley, took over the PAF air assets there, neutralized 
the officers, and operated the aircraft against government targets. Their 
task was made easier by conspiring with officers already inside Sangley 
like Navy Capt Pizarro of the Philippine Fleet and Navy Capt Jesus 
Durian, the Naval Base Commander. Durian denied being a rebel. Even 
PTV-4 was easily taken over by the rebels, again because defenders were 
greatly outnumbered. 

The failure of the rebels to launch a massive and sustained attack 
against the government forces particularly at Camp Aguinaldo during 
the early hours of the coup enabled reinforcements from the latter side 
to get themselves organized and to reach the various camps in time to 
repel the main rebel attacks. Failure to gain success within the day 
sealed the fate of the rebels. 49 This was facilitated by the loyalty of 
officers who refused to use strategic assets on behalf of the rebels. The 
pilots at VAB as well as those at MAB, who refused to fly any aircraft 
for BGen Comendador, crippled the rebels' capability to bring reinforce- 
ment troops from Mindanao and to attack government targets. Hence, 
Comendador had the aircraft but could not fly them. Consequently, the 
troops from Mindanao brought to MAB apparently for transshipment to 
Manila to reinforce rebels could not be flown out of Mactan. 

Perhaps the rebels' failure to mount a serious attack against govern- 
ment troops and installations and the reluctance of government troops 
to fire at the rebels could have been a function of their strong bonds of 
friendship and camaraderie. Soldiers detest fighting against fellow 
soldiers because the organization's unity, so essential to remaining an 
effective fighting force, would be breached. This could lead to the 
destruction of the army itself. Thus, as discussed in the Commission's 
Interim Report No. 2, the government pilots appeared unwilling to shoot 
at the rebel-controlled Tora-Toras (T-28) and Sikorskys, equipment that 
make them an effective fighting unit. Instead they fired warning shots 
at them, strafed the coasts along the Sangley runway, and only hit them 
when it became absolutely necessary. 50 This underlines the merit of the 
suggestion by MGen (Ret) Ramon Montano and BGen Loven Abadia that 
government troops should be commanded to fire immediately rather 
than talk to the other side to ensure their commitment. 



B.1 1. The Sorry State of Military Equipment 

Another reason for the pilots' hesitance to destroy the rebel aircraft 
is the inadequacy of equipment available to the AFP. This is the reason 
given by one of the F-5 pilots from Basa Air Base on why they exercised 
maximum tolerance when they first engaged the rebel T-28s. The 
country's long security relationship with the US has not only led to the 
neglect of its external defense capability but has also hindered it from 
modernizing its armed forces. The sorry state of its equipment was 
driven home to the Commission when it found out that intelligence 
messages could not be readily transmitted,resulting in the escape of 
rebel forces or in disadvantages to government forces. 

There was a marked difference between the arms allegedly usedty 
the coup leaders, their vehicles, and communications equipment, and 
those available to government forces. Although the rank and file used 
government-issued firearms and other supplies, the coup leaders had 
Uzis, Galils, and Ultimax guns, radio and telephone systems superiorto 
those used by government troops. It will be recalled that Honasan 
remains accountable for arms, ammunition, and communications 
equipment issued to him as the commander of the MND elite battalion. 
After the August 1987 coup attempt, four carloads of M-16s, Galils, and 
Uzis were presumably returned to him by Commo Marcelo. 61 Bibitfs 
Customs connections could have given him access to sophisticated arms 
smuggled into the country. The Armburst anti-tank weapon issued to 
Noble through Sgt Asterio Dejarme came from a parked van at the South 
Harbor. 

Pajeros, L-300 vans, and Land Cruisers appeared to be standard 
vehicles used by the coup plotters. In contrast, Col Clemente Mariano 
had to commandeer private trucks, including fish and fruit vendor's 
trucks, in order to ferry SOLCOM troops to Manila. 62 

The lamentable state of military equipment has also been cited by 
military personnel, both rebel and government, as a source of grievance. 
Inadequate medical facilities and supplies in the field had led soldiers to 
describe these facilities as Mona Lisa hospitals where "they just lie there 
and they die there." 53 They also complain about politicians who use the 
military's scarce helicopters in their provincial sorties thereby competing 
with military purposes such as evacuating the wounded and transporting 
troops and critical supplies where and when they are most needed. This 
practice fans their dissatisfaction with politicians whom they think 
spend more time "politicking" than doing their job in Congress. 



CHAPTER VII 499 



B.12. Will There Be Another Coup? 

When asked that question, the military's usual answer is that the 
rebel groups may have the capability for mischief, de-stabilization, or 
terroristic activities but they do not have the organic forces, critical 
mass, or covert network in the military establishment to launch an 
attempt anywhere near the magnitude of the one of December 1989. 

I 

Part of the reason is that the rebels may have committed almost all 
or most of their resources last December, and need some time to 
remobilize. Despite the impression that they have a large armory which 
had its origin as far back as the Marcos regime, they still engage in arms' 
raids under risky conditions. 

Secondly, the measures being taken by the government and the 
military after the December 1989 are better than those after earlier coup 
attempts. According to the military, the "cavalier" attitude toward coup 
participants is no longer practiced, to the extent that detainees are now 
protesting the "inhuman conditions" in military detention centers. A 
counter-intelligence unit has been organized directly under the CSAFP 
to address the problem of military mutinies. Loyalty to the Constitution 
is a major criterion for promotion and assignment to sensitive and 
command positions. And the benefits to soldiers continue to be improved 
despite the budgetary problem s of the government, although the difficult 
economic situation will increasingly be felt by the military and their 
dependents. 

i 

Thirdly, the communication program of the government to mobilize 
public opinion against coups and any kind of violent change has improved 
considerably. 

The Commission agrees with the military that the likelihood of a 
successful coup is remote. But, at this difficult economic period with 
more problems lurking around the corner, even the bombings that 
happen with disturbing regularity could push the country closer to a 
crisis, and the logical question is — do the rebels have the capability to 
make an attempt of sufficient magnitude and international impact, 
however ultimately unsuccessful, that would bring the country to crisis? 

The Commission believes that if the measures recommended in this 
Report are adopted and the processes are sustained for solidarity and 
Peace, first among the political parties, and next among all sectors, the 
rebel groups can be pre-empted from making such an attempt. At the 
foment, they appear to have lost some momentum in the war of nerves 



with government forces. If the government continues to press the 
initiative and manages to capture more of the core group, including 
Honasan, the pre-emption can be permanent. 

What about the possibility of a CPP-NPA tie-up with the RAM-HF 
or the YOU? As the December 1989 events demonstrated, even forces 
such as the RAM-HF and Loyalists, which may appear to be "oil and 
water", may have their own catalyzing element, at least for the short- 
run, in the overriding quest for power. That they will probably end up 
fighting among themselves over the "spoils", as indicated by attempts at 
one-upmanship last December, will not deter them from making tactical 
linkages. After all, they use a common language in representing them- 
selves as real reformers, are able to rationalize the use of violence to 
attain their ends, and have very little chance of winning in the electoral 
process. Thus, the 1992 election is not a feasible alternative to them, only 
an opportunity to radicalize the people if the process is flawed. Should 
other opportunities present themselves earlier, such as a severe economic 
crisis, they could get together as a matter of expediency. 

While the possibility exists, the strong anti-communist culture of the 
military, which the rebels adhere to and publicly espouse, is a strong 
deterrent against such an alliance. It would represent more of a 
contradiction than the RAM-HF-Loyalist coalition and could divide the 
rebel ranks. They must surely also realize that it would alienate 
whatever sympathy they may have among the disillusioned but law- 
abiding mainstream of society. 

B.13. Conduct Expected of Public Officials 

Sec 1, Article XI of the Constitution requires public officers to T>e 
accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, 

loyalty, and ... act with patriotism and justice n Moreover, elective 

and appointive officials take a solemn oath not only to "defend" but also 
to "preserve" the Constitution. Thus, they are duty bound as providedby 
Article 137 of the Revised Penal Code "to resist a rebellion by all means 
in their power." 

As against these standards of conduct prescribed for all public 
officials, the Commission makes of record the evidence it received 
regarding the activities and behavior of several opposition politicians, 
some of whom are elective officials, during the coup attempt. 

Since Vice President Salvador Laurel is the constitutional successor 
to the President, his actuations during the period of the attempted coup 



CHAPTER VII 501 



take on added importance. He was abroad when the coup occurred. 
Duringhis stopover in Hongkong, he gave a telephone interview conducted 
by John Eidino w on 3 December 1989 for British BroadcastingCorporation 
(BBC). 54 He refused at that time to condemn the coup which is all the 
more puzzling since the government forces were clearly in the ascendancy 
by then. Portions of the interview are quoted below for the reader's own 
consideration. 



John Eidinow : "There has been upheaval too in the Philippines. But 
it has involved armed conflict, deaths, and injuries as 
President Aquino who has put off six attempted 
coups and since the people power propelled her into 
office in 1986. The attempted coup has been declared 
crushed according to the Defense Secretary Fidel 
Ramos with early mopping up operations going on. 
The situation remains confusingbut President Aquino 
calls on the rebels thrice: surrender or die. A short 
while ago, I called Mrs Aquino's Vice-President but 
also an opposition leader, Salvador Laurel who's 
stranded in Hongkong to ask him for his attitude to 
the attempted coup and to the rebels. 

VP Laurel : It's something that should not have happened. It's 
very painful to see Filipinos fighting and killing 
brother Filipinos. And I think the situation was 
exacerbated by the intervention of the United States 
in this affair. 

John Eidinow : Rut I don't h »» r vmi rftP^mning fllfi rebeIa -

VP Laurel : WpII I don't w ant tfl iasjadgfi them T condemn the

government ? But I do not believe in the use of force 
and violence. I believe in constitutional and demo- 
cratic processes. [Emphasis supplied] 

John Eidinow : I'm surprised as far as the government's 

of the uprising is concerned. Do you think that Mrs 
Aquino's call to the rebels to surrender or die was the 
right course? 



I do not think that that was the right thing to say or 
do. You do not say that to people who are armed and 
ready to fight and die. I think, you know that's like 
waving a red flag at a bull. So I think she has not 
taken a more conciliatory position. I think we should 
have explored other avenues that could lead to an 
amicable settlement of the dispute. 

So although you condemn the course taken by the 
rebels, you still think that Mrs Aquino should have 
negotiated with them, but negotiate about what? 

Well, what are the gripes, what are the issues, what 
are the grievances that should be addressed. I see 
four immediate and major failures on the part of the 
Aquino government. The first is the failure to unite 
the nation, failure to adopt a policy of national 
reconciliation. Second is failure to enforce them. 
The President is the one principally tasked with the 
responsibility of enforcing and executing the laws, 
the laws primarily on graft and corruption have not 
been enforced. Third, is the failure to deliver basic 
services to the people. And this is a big disappoint- 
ment especially because of the promises that have 
been made and not fulfilled. Finally, the fourth and 
the last, is the failure to provide direction and 
leadership. I think there should be a reasonable 
dialogue before we resort to the last recourse. 

And given the answers of the dialogue, Hqvmi think

CHAPTER VII 503 



VP Laurel : Well, that is the constitutional reqiiireTner.fr As 
Vice-President I am required under the Constitution 
to succeed in specific instances. [Emphasis supplied] 

John Eidinow : Where do you think this leaves the Philippines now 
assuzningthattherebellionisin fact crushed? Where 
do you think this leaves your country? 

VP Laurel : I think it hurts the country very badly. The economy 
will surely be affected very adversely. And the 
investment climate will suffer. We try to get people 
to come to the Philippines to invest and it will take 
sometime before we can convince people to come to 
the Philippines again but I am confident that our 
people are a resilient people. We are used to adversity 
and I know we will bounce back especially under a 
good leadership, an effective and strong leadership. 

John Eidinow : The Vice-President of the Philippines, Salvador 
Laurel, speaking from Hongkong. . " 

The opposition Nacionalista Party (NP), as discussed in Chapter V, 
had a press conference at the Intercon which started at about 3:00 p.m. 
of 2 December and lasted for an hour. Intercon was not the original 
venue of this meeting. According to Bias Ople, Executive Vice President 
of the NP, at about 10:00 a.m. of 1 December, a member of the staff of Sen 
Juan Ponce Enrile, calling on behalf of the Senator, invited him to drop 
by the latter's residence at Dasmarinas Village, Makati, to informally 
discuss the future courses of action for the Party. 55 He arrived at the 
Enrile residence at about 1:30 p.m. Present on that occasion were 
Messrs Rene Espina, Bobby Brillantes, Geronimo Velasco, Ike Gutierrez 
(as representative of Vice-President Laurel), Dr & Mrs Rebecco Panlilio, 
and others he did not recognize. During their informal discussion, they 
saw the need to convene the Central Committee (CENCOM) of the Party 
because there were "members all over the country [who] were in the 
dark, and probably would appreciate some guidance from the Party on 
what was going on". 

Enrile suggested his residence as the venue for the meetingbut Ople 
pointed out that such a venue is not proper because the meeting ought 
to be in a public place*. Since the Hotel Intercontinental was a place 
most familiar to the members of the Central Committee", Ople suggested 
it and requested Gutierrez to arrange for the Dasmarinas Room ^ ot the 
Intercon for the meeting on the following day, at 1:30 p.m. to be followed 
kf a oress cnnfprpnrp at. 3:00 D.m. 66 



The decision to hold the press conference was made in the afternoon 
of 1 December. Purugganan, who was apparently the contact person to 
the RAM-HF command, moved elements of the FSRR to the Makati 
commercial district in the morning of 2 December after there was 
apparent agreement with government forces for the rebels to lay down 
their arms. By the time of the Nacionalista Party press conference, the 
rebels had full control of the vicinity of the Intercon. 

Ople claimed he left the Enrile residence at 4:00 p.m. on 1 December 
"before the waiters [who were to subsequently execute affidavits that 
they saw Honasan in the house] could arrive in the residence of Senator 
Enrile". 57 

When asked who were present during the CENCOM Meeting cum 
press conference, Ople testified before the Commission 

If you want me to help identify to the best of my ability those who were there, 
I think, I remember that Sen Arturo Tolentino was there, Vic Rabaya, Frisco 
San Juan, Isidro Rodriguez, Dominador Aytona, Rene Espina, Mabungkay 
Reonto [Alonto], Atty Regalado Maambong and there is one not listed here who 
was also there, Speaker, former Speaker Jose P. Laurel, Jr. Those are the 
names that I recall, who were among those present. And yes, Sen Enrile was 
there." 

The CENCOM Meeting was characterized by what Ople called 
"spirited exchanges among members of the Central Committee". And 
instead of what was originally intended (i.e., to provide guidance to party 
members who were in the dark and would have appreciated guidance 
from the party on what was going on), "primarily the meeting of the 
Central Committee dealt with a proposed position or statement concerning 
the emergency that was taking place at the time." 59 The proposed 
statement, which was admitted to have been drafted by Ople, was 
strongly critical of what the NP then considered "intervention of the 
United States through the Phantom Jets." 60 

The Ople draft underwent several changes in the course of the 
"spirited exchange". The first involved a change in the object of the 
statement's condemnation. Ople narrated 

You will note that in the third paragraph, in the fourth paragraph of page two. 
The statement says The Nacionalista Party does not countenance violence and 
stands by the Constitution of the Republic' In the original, it continued: *it 
deplores the military rebellion and the government's incapacity to contain it 
more quickly, more effectively, ... a situation reflecting directly on the 
adequacy, competence,and sustainability of the highest defense of military 
leadership In the corrected version however, it comes out as: 'it deplores 
however the government's giving cause to the military rebellion and its 



CHAPTER VII 505 



incapacity to contain it more quickly, more effectively* ... etc. So that is an 
example on how the original draft underwent certain changes in the course of 
the open deliberation . . 

Thus, while the original draft was explicitly against the attempted 
coup as it M deplore[d] the military rebellion* the revision made by 
the CENCOM withdrew said condemnation and instead deplored 'the 
government's giving cause to the military rebellion." Both Ople and 
Maambong, NP Deputy Secretary General in charge of research, agreed 
that the revision "entirely changed the whole meaning" of the 
condemnation.* 2 

The only other change in the Ople draft consisted of an amendment 
of the first sentence of the second paragraph of page 1 of the statement. 
In its original form r the sentence read as follows 

President Aquino, having lost the support of the Armed Forces of the Philippines 
requested for the US military rescue and President Geoige Bush of the United 
States ordered that the necessary force be committed." 

As given to the media, the phrase "shamelessly and without regard 
to national honor and dignity" was inserted on the second line between 
the words "Philippines" and "requested." 

Unaltered during the discussions were allegations in the Ople draft 
that the US Tighter craft apparently unmarked to disguise its origin, 
shot rockets that killed innocent Filipino civilians"; that President 
Aquino "lost the support of the Armed Forces of the Philippines"; and 
that the "brazen act of intervention belies President Aquino's claims that 
her government is in full control ofher military forces and that she enjoys 
broad popular support." 

When asked about the inconsistency of the above-statements with 
his own testimony before the Commission deploring the politics of hate 
and vengeance and espousing reconciliation and unity, and when 
confronted with the inaccuracy of the statements purported factual 
assertions, Ople asked the Commission to understand the NP statement 
in the light of "the atmosphere that prevailed at that time." He admitted 
that "if there is an opportunity to rewrite this statement, it would sound 
better and more balanced" and that it was actually "the very strong 
resentment of the American intervention ... at the time that strongly 
colored the language."* 4 

The press statement of the Central Committee of the Nacionalista 
Party on 2 December with the corrections 66 is attached to this Report as 
^Appendix. 



506 



During the press conference, individual members of the CENCOM 
gave statements of their own, among them Enrile, Abdul Khayr Alonto, 
Espina and Aytona. When asked by the Commission, Ople categorically 
denied that he made a statement asking President Aquino to resign. 
Such a statement, said Ople, "would be inappropriate.* 6 * 

However, the Commission has a videotape 67 of portions of the press 
conference in which Ople said 

There is a preponderant feeling which this statement has not captured in the 
ranks of the opposition that the constitutional legitimacy of President Aquino 
has been impaired by her own reckless renunciation of the sovereignty of the 
nation in order to, well, by seeking American support in order to prop herself up 
in power and this can constitute a very serious impairment of their own 
constitutional legitimacy. That is the reason there is a sentimen t that she 
should consider stepping down and giving wav to a government of national 
unity . But as I said, the text of this statement does not capture that sentiment 
and I'm saving this on mv individu al behalf rather than on behalf of the Central 
Committee of the Nacionalista Party. [Emphasis supplied] 

The press conference ended by 4:00 p.m. Ople proceeded to the 
Peninsula Coffee Shop since he "wanted some privacy with my (his) 
coffee." 

Senator Juan Ponce Enrile's personal comments during the press 
conference are equally revealing. He took pains to characterize the 
rebels as "antagonistic forces," "contending forces," or "challenging 
military elements," and when referring to the coup, he used such terms 
as "the situation," "this problem," or "military action against the Aquino 
government." 

His assessment of the ongoing coup attempt indicated a bias in favor 
of the rebels as he recounted, "I was told over the radio" that Camp 
Aguinaldo was surrounded by "the group challenging the government . 
. . in a perimeter around Greenhills, ... at the back of Camp Aguinaldo 
and ... at the White Plains side of Aguinaldo." [Emphasis supplied] He, 
moreover, saidthatbasedon" whatIhear overt.hft radio an d whf Unav ? 
read in the papers " [Emphasis supplied] the rebels controlled Legaspi 
Airport and they had reinforcement troops presumably coming from 
Negros Occidental and Iloilo, troops which were intercepted in Camarines 
Norte, and those coming from SOLCOM although in the case of the 
latter, it was not clear if 

they are with the side of the government or on the side of the challenging 
military elements. They claim that they are here for a peacekeeping purpose 
to serve as a neutral element. If this iB the situation, then this presents to you 
a spectacle of a government that has no command over the bulk of its own 
forces." 



CHAPTER VII 507 



After collating testimonies and after-battle reports, the Commission 
found Enrile's information about rebel troop movements accurate. His 
assessment of the action of government forces must have been based on 
his own perception of the events of February 1986, which he appears to 
continue to think was a successful coup against Marcos, instead of the 
triumph of people power. He said 

If they have 6,000 troops at their disposal at this point, then they should by now 
be able to mount a counter-attack and the longer this thing will last, I think it 
will become more difficult for the government to contain it. You see, from mv 
own experience, one of the main errors of tht> fnrmerretnmp w» R to rivens tim* 
inQUrfaYQr- Had they taken the initiative at the outset of the conflict, that was 
on Saturday, 22nd of February, especially during the night of Saturday and on 
Sunday morning, then maybe the situation would have been different . . 
[Emphasis supplied]. 

The above assessment indicates Enrile's optimism about the rebels' 
chances of succeeding in their attempt. Ople, on the other hand, testified 
to a contrary view. When asked what the evaluation of the Nacionalista 
Party was of the rebellion at the time of its CENCOM meeting, 
particularly on which side was winning, he said 

. . . there are those like mvaelf who thought that the issue of this confrontation 
had become clear, that the rebellion has been lost. Now. Tm sure there were 
Others who wanted to stretch the houndflriea of their optimism." [Emphasis 
supplied] 

Insofar as the portions of the videotape with the Commission shows, 
not only did Enrile blame the government for the coup attempt, but like 
Laurel, he failed to condemn the coup participants or call upon them to 
lay down their arms. 

Laurel and Ople even suggested that President Aquino consider 
stepping down. Rather than close ranks to defend the Constitution and 
the duly constituted authority, as required of public officers, both Laurel 
and Enrile took turns heckling the beleaguered government and thus 
contributed to the instability of the situation. They sounded as if 
President Aquino, and not the rebels, was the lawbreaker. 

B.14 The Role of Media in Crisis Situations 

The December 1989 coup attempt served to highlight the issues of 
*e role of media in a newly-restored democracy with weak political 
institutions in a Third World setting, and a well-developed media sector 
a |ong the lines of First World countries. The result is a continuous 
dilemma within media itself and tension between government regulatory 



508 



agencies and media which are all heightened in times of crisis, such as 
an attempted coup. 

The role of media is the dissemination of information. 71 It is an 
indispensible institution in a free society based on the fundamental right 
of the people to relevant, adequate, and accurate information. 72 When 
there is an ongoing coup, media play a difficult balancing act, more so for 
radio and television which have the capacity for live coverage. Media 
have to contend not only with physical danger, while grappling with the 
demands of their code of ethics on specific unfolding events, but also with 
regulatory officials with strong protective instincts for a government in 
real danger of being overthrown. 73 

This dilemma was present in the "play-by-play* radio broadcast of 
DZRH during the critical hours of the coup when the outcome was in 
doubt, the attempt by rebel leaders to appear on television and radio to 
propagandize their cause, and the inclusion in news reports of the gore 
and violence of the fighting. 

How is the dilemma to be resolved? During a coup attempt, as the 
media have the duty to inform the citizens, so has a government under 
siege the duty and the right to protect itself. Where the government 
leaves a vacuum, as it did in December, and the people need to be 
informed, media step into that vacuum. It is, therefore, part of the 
responsibility of government in reconciling the respective roles of 
government and media, to provide fast and accurate information during 
crisis, to use, if necessary, the governments own media resources to 
advance its interests, and, according to some communications practi- 
tioners and experts, even place embargoes on certain information or 
close down media establishments in situations of extreme danger 74 On 
the other hand, it is the right of media to protest and question such moves 
at the earliest opportunity and thereby enable society, through judicial 
or administrative rulings, to build up the jurisprudence and traditions 
that it considers appropriate. 75 

Ultimately, the most effective deterrent against inaccurate reporting 
that can amount to irresponsibility under extreme circumstances, is the 
self-discipline of a profession and its refusal to compromise itself with 
conflict of interest situations. 

An obvious conflict of interest situation arises when a journalist also 
engages in public relations. Then, the public may become the victim of 
inaccurate or baseless information for which nobody really takes 
responsibility. During the December 1989 events, several press releases 



CHAPTER VII 509 



of the rebels found their way into media through a person, Joan 
Orendain, who claimed that she was doing it as a journalist, but at the 
same admitted that she did not verify its authenticity before passing 
them on to her editor. She alleged that the releases were delivered to 
her apartment by unknown persons and she surmised that the rebels 
may have sought her out because she was a friend of a former RAM 
member (Robles) for which she was doing a personal favor because the 
person was being unjustly incriminated in the coup. In her testimony, 
Orendain constantly changed hats, between journalist and public 
relations, to explain her actions. The most charitable assessment for 
journalists of that genre is that they are confused about their 
responsibilities and their con stituences and should resolve their confusion 
for the sake of the entire profession. 

The issue of accurate reporting has its own solutions. According to 
the members of media, accuracy can be developed through adequate 
training and preparation, a system of apprenticeship, the inculcation of 
aculture of thoroughness, and the realization that a media person is first 
and foremost a citizen with a social responsibility. 76 It is better to rely 
on the self-discipline of the profession and err on the side of accommodation 
than to engage in repression, since drastic measures do not necessarily 
lead to improved professionalism and ethical standards, but perhaps 
even to the opposite, as the martial law era demonstrated. 77 

C. Recommendations 

Pursuant to its mandate under Republic ActNo. 6832, and recognizing 
that the ultimate responsibility for preventing coups rests with all the 
citizens, the Commission adopted Resolution No. 066 which sought from 
various organizations and/or sectors their suggestions towards this 
objective and the role they should play in attaining it. 

A number of organizations and individuals submitted position 
papers to the Commission, the names of which are listed in Appendix 
L to this report. The Commission is grateful for the cooperation of 
those who responded and acknowledges the suggestions which have 
been incorporated in its report. However, the Commission takes 
Ml responsibility for its recommendations in compliance with the 
requirement of RA No. 6832. 

The recommendations of the Commission are based on its analysis 
of the events, causes, environment, and lessons of the December 1989 
coup attempt. As previously explained, however, the Commission also 
examined the previous coup attempts since they are all inextricably 



510 



re- 



linked, in order to fully understand the context and dynamics of the 
December 1989 events. 



The recommendations are divided into three parts: 

1. "damage control" and short-term prescriptions to address the 
immediate problem of another coup attempt; 

2. an agenda for the remaining term of the Aquino administration; 
and * 



3. recommendations over the long-term. 



The recommendations are further classified, where appropriately 
sector or area of responsibility. The principal theme of these recom- 
mendations is justice — firmly, fairly, and consistently administered— 
as a basic principle of governance. People can bear poverty, but they 
cannot bear injustice. In fact, the accumulation of injustices, personally 
experienced or generally perceived, was the principal factor in the 
people's alienation from the Marcos administration, and to the eventual 
loss of its legitimacy. 

However, it should also be pointed out that if there is failure in the 
administration of justice in a society, government alone is not usually to 
blame. It is because there is a breakdown in the norms of conduct in the 
society itself. Thus, some recommendations are directed towards other 
sectors, e.g., the legal opposition, the business sector, educational 
institutions, and media. 

In the final analysis, the guarantee against coups, as well as other 
aberrant behavior, is the creation of a just, humane, and progressive 
society, the elements of which are set out in the Constitution. 

C.l. "Damage Control" and Short-Term Prescriptions 
to Address the Immediate Problem of Preventing 
Another Coup Attempt 

Since a coup d'etat is primarily a military operation which does not 
depend on mass civilian support for its success, immediate prescriptions 
should be directed at immobilizing, isolating, and capturing military 
rebels, both known or covert, before they can plan, recruit, or launch a 
coup. 



CHAPTER VII 511 



Addressing the immediate problem of another coup requires a set of 
prescriptions that fully recognizes the complex interaction of internal 
factors and external factors and the different degrees of participation 
and motive, and hence culpability. 

The Commission reiterates its recommendations in Interim Reports 
No. 1 (system of military justice) and No. 3 (needed legislation), and 
further recommends: 

a. Administering a justice and rehabilitation program to 
military participants as follows: 

i. Continuous trial for those already charged. 

ii. Speedy process for those under investigation a3 well as 
those recommended for prosecution, investigation, or reinves- 
tigation by the Commission in Chapter VI, e.g., some members 
of the Cebu PC and Air Force commands, members of the 
Guardian Centre Foundation Inc involved in the Bibit 
operation at the North and South Harbors and at the 
Domestic Airport. 

iii. Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all benefits, in valid 
instances allowing the attachment of their properties, and 
punishment to the full extent of the law for those found 
guilty as principals. Those with lesser offenses should be 
meted graduated punishment. 

iv. Strict enforcement of AW 68 for failure to report contacts, 
solicitations, and attempted recruitment to participate in 
coups. 

v. Immediate release of those against whom there is insufficient 
evidence for prosecution, without prejudice to a reopening of 
the cases, if warranted. 

vi. The restoration to the lineal roster of all those already 
cleared as well as those released for insufficient evidence. 

• 

vii. An amnesty program for young officers (majors and below) 
who are not principals and who have exceptional service 
records, provided they sincerely renounce all coups, pledge 
not to have any kind of involvement in any recruitment or 
planning for any coup, and agree to resign from the armed 



512 



forces. This is without prejudice to their re-commissioning 
after two-three years without loss of seniority for those who 
express such intention at the time they apply for amnesty 
and engage in community and/or public service approved by 
the government during the "rehabilitation" period. 

viii. An early retirement program which is available to all but 
primarily directed at those lagging behind in the promotional 
ladder for reasons of non-performance, those who believe 
they are being discriminated upon for being identified with 
the Marcos-Ver or Enrile groups, and those implicated with 
or suspected to be sympathetic to the rebels but against 
whom evidence may not be sufficient to prove guilt beyond 
reasonable doubt. The obj ective is not to invite the retirement 
of those officers the AFP wants to retain, but to give reasonable 
benefits to those who cannot meet the rigid requirements of 
a smaller officer corps and to provide an exit opportunity to 
those who believe that their careers have been impaired by 
their associations. It is the condition of such benefits that 
they not be found guilty subsequently of any crime against 
national security and public order. Otherwise, they are 
liable for the return of all the benefits plus interest. 

In the Commission's view, the amnesty and retirement programs 
are necessary to allow officers, whose opportunities in the military may 
be limited, to leave without any stigma. It will also totally purge the AFP 
of officers vulnerable to using their position to recruit for or participate 
in a coup, without driving them to desperate behavior for lack of live- 
lihood. The dilemma of the military is how to handle the loyal but 
dishonest or ineffective officer, or the honest and loyal but ineffective, or 
the effective and loyal but dishonest. While this is obviously a difficult 
decisi.on, there is really only one answer if the military is to be restored 
to an honest, loyal, and effective force. Anyone who does not possess all 
three qualifications should be removed. But, they should be encouraged 
and helped to find a useful career in civilian life. By depriving coup- 
prone officers of an institutional base, the program would reduce 
considerably the risk of another coup. It would constitute the first stage 
in the strengthening of a post-insurgency military that is smaller, more 
professional, and fully modernized. The program would also offer a 
second chance to young officers genuinely interested in resuming their 
military careers but who need to be totally expunged of any coup "virus" 
and to have the cloud over them permanently removed. Finally, the 
program would answer the military rebels' accusation of selective justice 
by the government, with the case of former NPA Victor Corpus as well \ 
as the amnesty program for NPAinsurgents being mentioned as example*. 



CHAPTER VII 513 



However, the granting of amnesty should be only one component of 
acalibrated response and should be judiciously applied. The government 
should not allow itself to be stampeded into a generalized program to 
"start with a clean slate", since that argument was used as a pipy in past 
coup attempts to merely preempt prosecution of incorrigible rebels. It 
should be emphasized that an amnesty may cure the symptom but not 
the disease (i.e., injustice, poverty). 

In conducting a "peace dialogue" with rightist rebels, the government 
should exercise utmost caution in choosing who to talk to. The government 
is advised not to start with the hardcore RAM-HF officers who have been 
involved in several coup attempts and are likely to exploit the process to 
advance their own agenda. 

bi, The strengthening of security measures on those under 
detention, e specially where there may be sympathetic guards. 

Le.. MuntiTiliipn 

The escapes of Honasan and Bibit who successfully co-opted or 
outwitted their guards should not be forgotten by the government. 
Nothing hurts the government's image more or frustrates those who 
made the capture, than to see maximum security suspects escape with 
ease and impunity. 

C. The intensification of efforts to capture kfiY. renegade 
soldiers with 9 special unit of twisted officers direct! vrespoiisibk 
frihenSAPp 

Honasan, Kapunan, Turingan, Batac, Bibit, Purugganan, and other 
central figures in the coup attempts should be specially targeted for 
capture. Despite the wide publicity given to the YOU and other military 
renegades as the potential source of new coups, the rebel cause would be 
setbackconsiderablybythecaptureoftheRAM-HFleaders. Furthermore, 

Republic perception is that these renegades cannot be captured because 
ftey are protected by elements within the military itself. Their capture 
would be a clear signal that the military is unequivocally committed to 
enforce the law, as repeatedly stated by the Commander-in-Chief herself 
each coup attempt. While several key rebels have been captured, 
lability of the core group to elude capture after such tough talk tends 
demoralize those who abide by the law and undermines the system of 
reward and punishment in the larger society itself. 



514 



d . A reinvestigation of the "God Save The Queen" plot and 
prosecutio n of all those implicated in it. 

There appears to be sufficient basis for the military to conduct a 
formal investigation of the incident, and for the government to cause 
the prosecution of everyone found to have been involved. The original 
excuses for not conducting an investigation are not, nor were they ever, 
valid, i.e., no overt action, the risk of dividing the military, the independent 
character of the DND security force from the normal chain of command, 
the hope that those implicated can still be reformed, if not prosecuted. If 
there is to be a total approach to the problem of coups, it is important to 
close the book on the incident. 

e. A review of the subsequent actuations of those involved 
in the Manila Hotel incident, both military and civilian. whQ 
pledged never to engage in similar adv enturism afrajn- if spared 

from prosecution, 

Those who are implicated or suspected with respect to the December 
1989 or any other coup attempts and are found to have violated their 
pledge should also be prosecuted for the Manila Hotel incident. 

f. An intensive follow-up investigation hv government DOliCfi 
agencies and the Justice Department of civilians imnliffltiftd ill 

the December 1383 attf mpt 

If the renegade soldiers are to be cut off from their support systems, 
the message to actual or potential civilian supporters must be clearly 
spelled out — there is no margin for tolerance when the survival of 
democracy is at stake. The Commission believes, based on selective 
cases (i.e., identifying the vessel that ferried the rebel troops from 
Bataan to Sangley, identifying the civilian network of Fusilero, examining 
the connection of the coup plotters with personalities in the Mindanao 
Freedom Movement, fund-raising activities from business, the Hawaii 
connection of certain civilians) that the investigation of civilians tends 
to concentrate on national figures. Thus, it is likely that the lower profile 
civilian support network for the rebels is still intact. This could include 
persons on which the Commission's investigation has not been completed 
because, in its judgment, the incremental information that might be 
secured would not be justified by the cost. The investigation could be 
done by the DOJ in the course of its normal activities. This matter is 
covered by a formal resolution of the Commission to the DOJ. 



CHAPTER VII 515 



<r, ftneedv action on anneals ny fr decisions of AFP cnnrta- 
jjinrtial. 

This has already been mentioned in the Commission's Interim 
Report No. 1. Related to this are the cases which are not being acted upon 
or are suffering undue delays. Actions on decisions on courts-martial 
which are subject to mandatory appelate review or which may eventually 
reach the President fpr confirmation should be speedily resolved. 

h. The earlv passage of a comprehensive law on the 
establishment of the National Police 

Implementing the Constitutional provision would remove the anxiety 
and insecurity of those likely to be affi ectedby the new law. Furthermore, 
the sooner such a law is enacted, the earlier could programs be imple- 
mented to separately strengthen the police and military organizations 
and resolve the confusion of overlapping jurisdictions. 

j, The immediate implementation of a comprehensive 
Program to provide timely rescue and medical assistance to 

fawpfi wounded jn combat, 

The rebels have tried to claim credit for improving the benefits of 
soldiers. Unfortunately, the timing of such improvements (many have 
been instituted after coup attempts) have lent some credibility to these 
claims. The government is aware of the complaints about the inadequacy 
of medical andhospitalization benefits particularly of soldiers in combat. 
A comprehensive initiative of the government to help wounded soldiers 
would highlight its continuing concern, lift troop morale, and direct 
credit to where it belongs. 

L , A review hv the military flf jtg decision to disband the 
TORflTlfTrBfriTTlfTlt. 

While the coup culture may have been implanted by Honasan 
and his group in some officers of the FSRR, it is not clear that it is 
Permanently ingrained in the troops. It is also true that the military 
hierarchy may have unwittingly allowed it to happen and are, therefore, 
Perceived to be arbitrary and unduly harsh. The FSRR may be one of the 
most effective units against the communist insurgency and should not 
end up being bitter and ineffective. Besides, attaching the Rangers to 
°ther units without first making sure they are rid of the coup "virus 
*ould only facilitate the spread of the affliction. What makes the 
Rogers an elite unit, other than their training, is the spirit of oneness 



516 



and collective pride. It is a spirit that must be harnessed rather than 
dispersed. The solution should be the assignment of officers who 
command the respect of the soldiers and who are themselves absolutely 
committed to democracy. 

k. An immediate audit of the value formation urogram nf tha 
military and, with the help of civilian experts, the formulation 

of an intensive program (essentially constnictiYfi indoctrination), 
and the training of field Eftmman tiers to carry it out. 

The Commission received conflicting testimony on the effectiveness 
of the present program and noted that the military is reluctant to 
extensively use civilian expertise presumably in the belief that civilians 
cannot fully understand the military mind. The result, asplayedup also 
by newspaper reports, is a traditional, repetitive, and unimaginative 
approach such as that used with and ridiculed by some of the Scout 
Rangers. Thus, the results of the program in specific units is quite 
uneven, depending on the individual skill of its commander. 

1. The immediate removal or reassignment of officers ftflws 

than 100 percent lovaltv from sensitive positions in the militaTi 
hierarchy, i.e.. intelligence, operations, logistic, nTlti training 
functions 

Consistent with the policy of not taking any risks at this time, and 
of forging a military with unquestioning loyalty to the Constitution, 
those with any taint of the coup should first be tested in less sensitive 
positions (assuming they do not retire early) before being given choice 
assignments. 

m. — The immediate distmndment of CtCFI and all ftflg 

organizations not authorized hv the military. 

Such organizations encourage factionalism and give opportunities 
for those with hidden agendas to exploit and manipulate them, i 

n. The observance of a systematic selection process forthfi 
new Chief Of Staff that generates the lea st mn troversv nhOllttfafi 

choice. 

The possibility of deep selection should not be foreclosed. An 
important criteria should be an impeccable record and reputation tot 
non-partisanship, since the 1992 elections will be a critical test for 
democratic and peaceful change. 



CHAPTER VII 5J7 



n. Just as in the civilian government. a er ackdown hv ffr e 
military, on some "big fish* corrunt offers, 

There are apparently officers known within the military 
establishment to be corrupt and are perceived to be protected for 
personal or political reasons. The value of example cannot be under- 
estimated to restore the confidence of those alienated by reason of their 
own knowledge or experience of corruption in the military. In particular, 
those in "syndicates" engaged in illegal gambling should be dealt with 
uncompromisingly. 

p. An immediate stop to unfair and/or humiliati ng treatment 
and criticism of military officers bv Congress and other public 

officials especially those before the Commission on 
Appointments. 

Political "grandstanding" is especially grating to the troops in the 
field, who feel that they are risking their lives for the wrong people. 

q. Sneedv and firm disciplinary action and/or prosecution 
against numbers of the military involved in human rights 
violations fls well as of civilian law enforcement personnel 

involved in yictimimng military personnel. 

There should be no "sacred cows" when it comes to dispensation of 
justice. 

L The purchase or charter hv Congress of itff OWH 

fransnnrt^jo n facilities an d » prohibition on their use of military 

Mmipmentnndninmft. 

Another common complaint of both rdbel and government military 
officers is the use by members of Congress of military equipment, 
particularly aircraft, for their own purposes. On the one hand, such 
assets are perceived to be badly needed to support the troops in the field. 
On the other hand, the legitimate function of the legislature to appropriate 
fonds, monitor the use of public money, and enact measures, would not 
fully served if it did not have access to field observations and dialogues 
with such an important sector as the military. The Commission, there- 
fore, suggests that Congress be allowed to purchase or charter a pool of 
transportation equipment, including airplanes, that can be utilized for 
official purposes, such as field inspections of military operations, provincial 
consultations, monitoring of the use of funds in emergency operations 
^d calamities, and other similar purposes. In the long run, such 



arrangements will prove to be the most economical, efficient, and 
practical way of dealing with the issue. 



a. The expansion of the government's public information 
program which has considerably and commendahlv imnmvfld 
since December 1989. with more participation bv local 
government officials. 

One of the most common complaints of the rebel soldiers is the 
absence of local officials particularly in insurgency areas. The local 
officials are the frontliners in the delivery of government services. They 
should be required to be in the field and their activities duly recordedfor 
dissemination through the government's public information program. 
Systematizing the flow of information between the executive and local 
government officials should also prove useful for other purposes, i.e. f 
calamities, rebel troop movements. 

t> The provision of sufficient resources anfl ffiimrort to Arc 

Deputy Ombudsman for the Military 

The filling up of this position is consistent with the findings of the 
Commission. He must be given the resources to do his job since the 
appointment has raised expectations within the military that their 
grievances will be heard. In organizing the staff of the office, care should 
be taken not to appoint those with "scores to settle" and worn-out ideas. 
It is time for young blood with fresh ideas, if the problems of the military 
are to be resolved. 

C.2. An Agenda for the Remaining Twenty-One Months ct 
the Aquino Administration 

The constitutional term of the present administration is 76 months. 
There are only 21 months left of that term to complete the successful 
transition of the country from a dictatorship to a full-fledged democracy. 
That task is not that of the President alone, or of the government, but 
of the entire society itself. 

Despite the installation of the formal structures and the advancesin 
democratic processes, the EDS A Revolt that installed Corazon C.Aquino 
as President did not result in the far-reaching revolution many people 
had hoped for. Most of these expectations were embodied in the new 
Constitution, but have largely remained unfulfilled. Therefore, stated 
simply, the job to be done in the next 2 1 months is to galvanize the people 
behind a national vision based on the agenda ratified by the people. 



chapter vn 519 



a , On the part of the Executive Department, a review of W 
ppiigjfig and programs in the light of results, an acceritanee of 
flfrnrteomings where these exist, and a performance review of 
Appointive officials. 

Chapter III of this report describes how the "rainbow coalition" of 
1986 quickly unraveled because there was no organic unity in the first 
place, only a common goal of removing a dictator. Yet, the disunity is not 
necessarily an affliction of the grassroots. All the social surveys indicate 
a discernible consensus of the people on major issues, some of them 
considered as controversial, i.e., agrarian reform, foreign debt, US 
military facilities, coup d'etat. Unfortunately, these are often obscured 
by the posturings of politicians and extremist groups, and the indecision 
of the Executive Department 

The first step, therefore, in putting the country back on track is to 
galvanize national unity. 

As part of the process of self-reflection, the Executive Department 
must review existing policies and programs and establish clear 
directions for the next 21 months, particularly in the area of basic 
services. Government officials whohave not performed or are responsible 
for failed programs have to be replaced. The economic situation and 
shortfalls in performance relative to targets cannot all be blamed on 
external factors and inherited problems. Furthermore, much can still be 
accomplished in 21 months. That is approximately the" difference 
between the first term of a resectable president under the 1935 Constition 
and the six-year term of a non-reelectable president under the new 
Constitution. The expectation is a president will act as a statesman 
during that period rather than as a politician seeking another term. 
However, the appointment of new people would only make sense if the 
correct policies and programs are in place. Two major revamps occurred 
after coup attempts and were perceived to have been a reaction to the 
coups rather than a genuine effort to address issues of substance. 
Subsequent events tended to validate this perception. What is being 
asked of the Executive Department is to enforce the same principle of 
accountability being required of the military. 

While there is understandably a reluctance by President Aquino 
to exercise power in a manner that might be compared with former 
President Marcos, a democracy in a crisis of transition calls for a iirmer 
and more direct hand at the helm. People understand that a snip is 
neveralwaysoncourse. But the ship that arrives safely at its destination 



520 



is the one which constantly checks its bearings, corrects itself on time, 
and accelerates its speed when it is firmly on course. 

The leader who transcends himself will be followed by his crew, 
even those who may believe that there is a shorter and safer route. Itis 
the vision and the decisiveness that count. 

R On the nart of the President, a categorical declaration of 
her position with respect to the issue of re-election. 

In view of the unsettled constitutional issue of her right to seek re- 
election in 1992 and the continuing speculation on her intent to run 
despite her past pronouncements to the contrary, an unambiguous 
declaration on her part would be timely and would be perceived as an act 
of statesmanship rather than a politician's ploy. 

c, On the part of the President, the, immfrdinta convening of 
the National Security Council and an initiative to invite all 
political parties to enter into a compact, to whirti peoples 

organizations and citizen groups would also s^s^he. to defend 
and preserve our democracy, ahiure the use of fofff and yjfllfilififi

peaceful, and credible elections in 19Q2. and arrivf fit «n1«tions 

to our national problems through an honest and opfn debate of 

issues and programs! 

and 

on the part of the political op position, a p ofritlyf rf FP OT1se to 
the call for a united front against unconstitutional me*™ ta 
change the government and for upholdingdf mp^ra tic processes 

The ruling coalition and the opposition must agree on a constructive 
relationship to save and strengthen democracy. Both must learn the 
distinction between political debate on the basis of issues and the 
exigencies of political maneuvering to take or keep power. The climate 
of distrust, extra-constitutional tendencies, and the politics of perso- 
nalities must somehow be changed. In the case of Vice President Laurel, 
the government must decide either to file charges or carry out an 
initiative to provide him with a role befitting an official elected by the 
people to the second highest position of government. 

The President can take the initiative in creating a new climate of 
"unity in diversity" by immediately convening the National Security 



CHAPTER vn 521 



Council. Then, she can issue a call for all political parties to sign a solemn 
compact before the people to uphold democracy, to resist with all the 
resources at their command any attempt to subvert or destroy it, and to 
participate fully in the elections in 1992. 

The political opposition must be willing to respond positively to this 
initiative, following the example of their counterparts in such countries 
as Venezuela and Argentina where they actualized a vow to set aside 
their differences when democracy is threatened by military adventurism. 
One does not have to be in power to contribute to nation-building. 

The Nacionalista Party led by Bias Ople and Senator Enrile missed 
a historic opportunity to put into practice what it preaches by way of 
reconciliation and commitment to democracy. Its press conference on 2 
December 1989 turned out to be an opportunistic attempt to play up to 
the rebels and gain political points at a time of great peril for democracy. 
Vice President Laurel likewise fumbled his own opportunity for states- 
manship while in Hongkong at the time. There is, however, no reason, 
given the shifting tide of politics, why the opposition cannot recover from 
the widespread disapproval of the people of its behavior during the 
December 1989 coup attempt, if it is perceived to be unequivocal about 
its commitment to democratic processes. 

The solidarity of the political leadership is a giant step in addressing 
the issue of a military that is isolated from the society it is supposed to 
protect. 

d. On th e nnrt of the T*«n'«1«tive Department flfld the

of national life, 

Since the insurgency problem appears to be close to a solution, the 
government must design a post-insurgency program for the military, 
within the framework of the Constitution. The establishment of a 
commission of respected civilian and military experts appointed by the 
President, with full powers and a budget to carry out its task, would 
deliver a strongmessage to the military that the government cares about 
*eir future, recognizes the existence of deep-seated and complex 
Problems, and is determined to solve them. The program itself should 
evoke a resolve in the military to perform better in the field and thus 
hasten the victory over both the communist and Muslim insurgencies, a 
vital component of the program is its thorough modernization and the 



522 



termination of its dependency on the US for its weaponry. Another 
component is a reformulation of the education system and training of 
officers. This would include a review of the program at the PMA and the 
establishment of other service academies. Although no direct correlation 
has been established between the PMA curriculum and the disposition 
of officers to engage in coups, testimonies of senior military officers call 
attention to the need to: 

i. Intensively inculcate civilian values among the military; 

ii. Cultivate a peer relationship between officers and civilians 
starting at the college level by examining the desirability of 
making the military academies the last two years of a college 
degree or of requiring the cadet to spend his junior year in a 
civilian university; 

iii. Institute measures to further democratize access to mili- 
tary academies and to discourage the emergence of an elitist 
military class that isolates the officers from the rest of 
society and negates the constitutional concept of a citizen 
army. Related to this is the problem of factionalism that 
is exacerbated by the dominance of PMA graduates in 
leadership and key positions in the military; 

iv. Upgrade the status of the teaching function in military 
academies to the level of combat command with financial 
incentives, performance credits, and promotional advantages, 
and invite more civilian instructors to handle non-military 
subjects, 78 and 

v. Temper the overly idealistic orientation at the PMA, and 
emphasize love of country as the most desirable value in an 
officer. 79 

The Commission considered other options than the appointment of 
anew independent body in order to avoid any incremental burden on tne 
budget. Among the alternatives considered were (a) a task force unae 
the Department of Defense, (b) a special unit under the Deputy 
Ombudsman for the Military, (c) a composite committee under the Office 
of the President to be supervised by the Executive Secretary, (d)tl> e 
National Security Council, and (e) a special commission under the Office 
of the Vice-President. 



CHAPTER VII 523 



A special commission under the DND, the NSC, or the Executive 
Secretary would have the handicap of having to use people who have 
other responsibilities and who might not be able to impart the sense of 
importance and urgency to the task at hand. In any case, the core of a 
new staff has to be appointed. With respect to the Office of the Vice 
President, the same staffing requirement would apply with the additional 
handicap that the office is an elective one and the task of the special 
commission is unlikely to be finished by mid-1992. The Deputy 
Ombudsman has a fixed tenure. However, his office would also need to 
recruit new staff. In the ultimate analysis, the same incremental cost 
for staffing would be incurred for all the alternatives, with the only 
difference being the additional cost of the commissioners who will 
oversee the program on a full-time basis, with respect to this Report's 
recommendations. 

More importantly, a new task-oriented commission, possibly with a 
fixed term, would provide the necessary continuity, urgency, and sense 
of priority, that may well prove to be more economical than the cost in 
lives, money, and lost opportunities of military adventurism. 

For having made this suggestion, members of the Fact-Finding 
Commission should not be consideredfor appointments this commission.

The 1992 elections will be a critical test of democracy since the 
electoral process is often perceived as a way to legitimize the continued 
political domination of a few. 

Both the Executive and the Legislative Departments should make 
urgent decisions regarding the synchronization in 1992 of elections as 
mandated by the Constitution. A lead time of two years is necessary tor 
Planning and for the procedures, equipment, selective fomputenzation 
andorganization to be firmly in place on time. The legislation and budget 
for such preparations should already be enacted. Since elections is a

rebel soldiers and the CPP/NPA for political intervention because of 
what they will describe as elitist and, therefore, meaningless results of 
elections. 

Specifically, Congress should enact laws on the empowerment of 
independent people's organizations, the party-list system of repre- 
sentation, anti-dynasty, equal access to media time and space, subsidy 
program for poor but deserving candidates or their watchers, and 
procedures to enable the disabled and the illiterate to participate fully 
in the process. 

£ The supremacy of civilian authority over the military 

should be established bv the appointment, as soon as practicable, 
of civilians with the capability, integrity, and leadership to head 
the Department of National Defense 03ND).theN^HoTifl1 Security 

Council (NSC), and the National Intelligent Coordinating 
Agency (NICA). The NTCA should have its own intelligence 

capability that can complement as well as validate military 
intelligence information. 

This recommendation does not detract from the outstanding and 
loyal service of Secretary Fidel Ramos in defending the government 
against attacks from both leftist and rightist extremists. The policy of 
appointing a civilian as head of DND should be adopted not only by this 
government but subsequent ones in compliance with the spirit, if notthe 
letter, of the constitutional principle of the supremacy of civilian authority. 
Establishing the policy would integrate the military into the civilian 
government and induce a continuous supply of knowlegeable career 
civilians with the authority of expertise in military affairs. Eventually, 
military resentment about alleged "interference" of civilians would be 
muted. 

The need for an independent and civilian-controlled intelligence 
network responsible directly to the President is highlighted by the fact 
that the Office of the President is totally dependent on the military for 
intelligence and in several instances appeared to be less than fully 
informed of developments. No matter how well-meaning the military 
intelligence community may be, the idea of sharing "top secret" 
information with a civilian does not appear to be accepted practice, 
even if that civilian happens to carry the title of Commander-in-Chief 
(C-in-C). 

Secondly, J2 or the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence (AFP) 
reports to the Chief of Staff who, in practice, does not really function as 



CHAPTER VII 525 



"staff to the C-in-C. The common perception within the military and, 
for that matter, among the public , is that the responsibility for military 
decisions ends at the desk of the CSAFP. This has less to do with the 
fact that the present C-in-C is a woman than the presumption that the 
man in uniform knows best on such matters, and the culture of enduring 
fraternal ties within the military. 

Thfi institutionalization of necessary improvements in 
ftp militar y in the areas of promotion and assignments. 
Plirphflsing and auditing, educational benefits abroad, and 
mmpulsorv attendance at military command schools. 

The Commission's recommendations cannot be exhaustive. These 
improvements would be part of the terms of reference of the proposed 
special full-time commission to define the role of the military in the post- 
insurgency period. Examples, however, would be a review of the policy 
of merely rotating incompetent officers rather than weeding them out, 
instituting measures to decongest the "bunching* of middle level officers 
as aresult of the accelerated expansion of the military in the mid-1970's 
on the one hand and the relative shortage of junior field officers on the 
other, the laxity in allowing Lt Cols to avoid going to the Command and 
General Staff College (CGSC) where their fitness for promotion or 
separation from the service is determined. 

With respect to purchasing and audit procedures, the military and 
the Commission on Audit (CO A) must work out a practical solution to the 
problem of "conversion", i.e., spending the money for other than the 
budgeted purpose not necessarily because of graft and corruption but 
because of the needs in the field and the bureaucratic tape involved in 
complying with all the technicalities of disbursement. The Commission 
suggests that the military and the COA agree on a standard method by 
which the principle of transparency is practiced all the way down to the 
smallest unit by providing all the information about its budget to the 
soldiers. Although this is already being practiced in many units, much 
still needs to be done particularly in the matter of "conversion . ine 
Philosophy shouldbe to challenge the military to perform better through 
a system of decentralization, transparency, and an appeal to tne 
traditional military values of integrity and discipline, and relying on 
formal and informal sanctions for enforcement. 

With respect to availments of educational benefits and f ^ional 
assignments abroad, special efforts must be made to ehimnate the tayo- 
tW system and to use the reward system to broaden the linkages of the 



526 



military and reduce its dependence on the US, and recognize performance 
and loyalty to the Constitution. 

lu — The President and the Commission on Ap pointing 
must work out a system hv which renommPTiHttrt^fl fo r 
Promotions can he categorized in practi ce to avoid tlu> 
exploitation of the confirmation process fo r political nnrpn^ fl, 

The appointments to the Chief of StafFposition and the top positions 
in the major service commands have a political dimension which requires 
the exhaustive inquiry of the Commission on Appointments in the 
proper exercise of the principle of checks and balances. However, other 
appointments might merit a progressively different treatment based on 
institutional courtesy. 

L If justice is going to he a living prin ciple of governance, the 
budgets Of the Judiciary and the Department of Justice (DOJ) 
must be increased in order to upgrade the ph ysical facilities. 
recording, investigative and prosecutive oanahilitv. and staffing 
of the system. 

The budget of the Judiciary amounts to 1.08 % of the 1990 national 
budget. It is a grossly inadequate amount and should be increased in 
view of its critical role and the national scale of its responsibility as the 
conscience of the nation. 

The Commission recommends the same approach with respect to the 
budget of the DOJ. The existence of honest judges and efficient courts 
would not result in a better administration of justice without a corres- 
ponding improvement in the investigative and prosecutorial capability 
of the DOJ. The courts can only decide on the evidence before it. If that 
evidence is inadequate and its presentation flawed and incompetent, the 
wheels of justice will not turn efficiently. The DOJ's budget for 1990 is 
only .5% (one-half of 1%) of the national budget. A significant increase 
in its budget should be considered to modernize facilities and equipment, 
provide furiding for proper investigation and preparation of cases, and 
keep and attract the best people for the job.

CHAPTER VII 527 



The business sector is not a homogeneous group — a set of economic 
policies that favors one industry can hurt another — and engages in a 
broad range of partisan political activity. But its long-term interest is 
in strengthening democracy regardless of partisan politics or of any 
temporary advantage to business that authoritarianism may appear to 
offer. Authoritarianism in the Philippine experience eventually means 
arbitrary interference in private business, and lack of progress. This is 
the painful lesson we have learned, the same lesson which is being 
validated by the experience of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe 
today. Therefore, business should act as one— to help restore confidence 
in the economy by keeping and investing its resources in the country, to 
deny support to military rebels, to resist the temptation to subvert the 
electoral process to advance business interests, to pay correct taxes, and 
to keep honest rather than corrupt the bureaucracy. Beyond that, 
business must be willing to transcend itself by supporting rather than 
obstructing policies that dismantle the economic privileges of a few and 
diffuse the fruits of progress to the greatest number. In an economic 
slowdown, its social responsibility is to protect the jobs of its employees 
and to rtlieve them, as much as possible, from the burden of adjustment 
to adverse business conditions.

the institutional mandate of separation of church and State, 
the boundaries of which may shift from time to time. 

The biblical passages condemning rebellion, the exhortation against 
contributing to it, the moral duty to uphold duly-constituted authority, 
provide the church with a strong moral suasion to deter rebels and to 
unite people behind democracy. Its influence should also be brought to 
bear on solving the problems of gambling, graft and corruption, and 
structural poverty. In the more immediate future, the role of the church 
is to catalyze the peace process and to progressively expand it, regardless 
oftheobstaclesplacedin its path. The success ofthe peace process would 
heal the festering wounds of the nation and also pave the way to a 
meaningful electoral process and democratic change in 1992. 

m. The resolution of the dilemma faced hv media in crisis 
reporting lies more in the media itself rather than government 

regulations. 

While government should take whatever measures it considers 
appropriate to defend itself, such measures, when perceived to impair 
press freedom, should be immediately questioned, until a body of juris- 
prudence and tradition is accumulated. Because the preferred option is 
self-regulation and self-discipline, media should proceed with their 
initiatives in formalizing their own ethical standards, strictly enforce 
them, and inform the public of such efforts. It is also incumbent on media 
to define the bounderies of their profession not only during crisis but also 
in conflict of interest situations. Media should accept the responsibility 
to discipline erring members, to provide training and guidance to its 
apprentices, and to establish linkages with responsible counterparts 
abroad to broaden their experience and perspective. 

C.3 Recommendations Over the Long-Term 

A crisis does not develop overnight. It passes through symptomatic, 
acute, and chronic stages with progressive indicators on the severity of 
the situation. The task of leadership is to read the signals early enough 
so that the acute and chronic stages are bypassed and the problems 
resolved even before the crisis is reached. 81 

A coup d'etat does not happen overnight. Neither does a revolution 
or popular uprising of the citizenry itself. The responsibility ofthe 
politicalleadershipistobuildanationalconsensusonwhatmustbedone 
to address the underlying problems indicated by the symptoms. Since 
many ofthe problems of the country are structural in character, there are 



CHAPTER VII 529 



no quick solutions, although one can resort to "damage control" and 
short-term alleviation to buy time. The longer-term solutions, however, 
must start today. 

*' 

C3.a. Love of Country as the Highest Value. 

On the premise that the soldier is first a citizen before he becomes a 
military man and officers do not enter military school until after high 
school, it follows that our system of education has not been successful 
in transmitting the proper values to our students. The extent of the 
overhaul of the educational system is a matter for legislation, but the 
greater responsibility is in the entire education sector, public and 
private, for it doe s appear that it must do a better job at value formation, 
with love of country as the highest value. This will take time and will 
need to be reinforcedby the family and the church. In addition, something 
must be done about public school teachers. How can they impart correct 
values when they themselves are demoralized, badly trained, and lack 
dedication and discipline?The Executive and the Legislative Departments 
have a joint responsibility to formulate a long-term and properly funded 
program to improve the educational system. 

C.3.b. Social Justice 

The full implementation of the social justice provisions of the 
Constitution. Until the gross inequalities of wealth and power are 
corrected, the ferment for change and the vulnerability of the men-at- 
arms to political intervention will continue. For the great majority ot the 
military belong to the underprivileged class as well. 

C.3.c. Citizen Army 

The full implementation of the citizen army concept and the 
designated role of a small, modernized, and professional military m a 
democratic society. The de-linking ofthe military from th e Ub on 
weaponry,its assumption ofthe external defense responsibility,^ 
immediate phaseout ofthe US facilities in Philippine bases and removal 
of all the vestiges of its colonialism would constitute the basac miht^- 
related steps toward becoming a truly sovereign and independent 
nation. 

C.3.d. Decentralization 



The decentralization ofthe national government « •P^J*^ 
for the efficient delivery of government services. The devolution of power 



530 



to local communities would bring the government closer to the people 
and reduce the isolation of rural communities whose poverty tends to 
politicize officers in the field. 

C3.e. The Constitution 

After an appropriate period, to give the present Constitution an 
opportunity to be tested, formal consultations should be conducted at the 
grassroots on the desirability of constitutional amendments and of the 
specific proposals advanced by the different sectors. A rush to amend 
the Constitution, including the basic structure of government, to suit 
contemporary problems is not always the answer. The people must be 
prepared to make amendments if it is clear that the fundamental law 
has proven to be irrelevant or inapplicable to the times. But the best way 
to test the relevance of the Constitution is not by speculative theories but 
the implementation of its key provisions, particularly on the diffusion of 
wealth and political power (social justice), and on economic progress 
with equity. 

D. Choosing Democracy 

If a coup d'etat starts in the minds of men, then it is the collective 
will of a unified people that can prevent and overcome it. 

The people must choose democracy. 

To flourish, democracy must become the living mortar that binds us. 
To work, it must come from a people that have willed their own liberation 
from poverty, dependency, and disunity. For it has truly been said that 
"democracy is based upon the conviction that there are extraordinary 
possibilities in ordinary people.* 82 

When there are forces that would destroy democracy, only the 
strength that comes from such a people can protect and uphold it And 
the irreducible minimum to peaceful and orderly change, both societal 
and political, is for all the contenders in the political arena to agree to 
use the ballot and forego the bullet —for the path of peace is the path to 
progress, social justice, and nationhood.

(1) Sworn Testimonies before the Fact- Finding Commission (FFC) of 
Lt Col Arsenio Tecson, 1 March 1990; Lt Col Ericson Aurelio, 
10 March 1990; Lt Col Oscar Legaspi, 12 March 1990; and BGen 
Edgardo Abenina, 5 March 1990. Tecson, Aurelio and Abenina 
recounted their experiences in the field where they saw the lack 
of basic services even in areas near Manila. For Legaspi, the 
government's non-delivery of basic services, in spite of the tax 
raise, is one of the causes not only of the December 1989 coup 
attempt, but also that of August 1987.

22 March 1990; Lt Rolando Cal, 21 March 1990; LtAugusto

1990; Capt Gregory Ramos, 27 March 1990; Capt Proceso 
Maligalig, 12 March 1990; BGen Edgardo Abenina, op. cit. : and 
BGen Jose Comendador, 5 February 1990. According to these 
officers, graft and corruption is one of the alleged major causes 
of the coup. It exists not only in the civilian government but also 
in the military establishment as well. According to Lt Cal, even 
officers with fine records joined the coup because of discontent 
over widespread graft and corruption. For Maj Irizari, it is the 
number one problem in the country. In the military, according 
to Cmdr Maligalig, corruption exists in the form of the over-pricing 
of military uniforms and supplies, "conversion deals", and usurious 
loans. "Conversion deals" are those which involve the creation of 
artificial allocations in the budget for the purpose of circum- 
venting the rules and regulations of the Commission on Audit 
Corruption also exists in the administration of benefits. LtCal 
testifies that junior officers do not complain even if they have 
knowledge of the corrupt practices because when they confront 
senior officers about them, they are just brushed aside.

between the law and its implementation. Oftentimes, there 
is a proposal but it never gets to be implemented. As a result, 
poverty, especially in the countryside, is appalling,he said. Marquez

comments that poverty and the sufferings of the people are the 
battlecries of the coup plotters. For Comendador, poverty is one 
of the causes not only of coups but of the communist insurgency 
as well.

about by factionalism in the military. Maligalig says that any 
superior officer appointed to akey position almost always brings 
in his team. Although this is natural, what is perceived as wrong 
is that preferential treatment results out of this practice, espe- 
cially in housing, promotions, and schooling. The military leader- 
ship was also considered as unresponsive particularly when it 
comes to financial and logistical support for soldiers in the field. 
Legaspi laments the fact that while the military leadership pro- 
cures expensive jets, soldiers in the field remain barefoot. Cal 
says that the men in the field are given supplies and equipment 
of inferior quality. They also complain that the pay and allowances 
that soldiers get are not commensurate with the responsibility 
given to them. 

(6) Legaspi Testimony, op. cit For Legaspi, the government's recon- 
ciliation policy is selective. He views it as pro-Left. 

(7) Ibid. He said that justice is unequally dispensed. In terms of 
investigating human rights violations, the AFP is the only target. 
He also said that while the CPP/NPA are charged with simple 
rebellion, rightists and some members of the AFP are charged 
with rebellion completed with murder.

plotters have vested personal interests. He cited the examples of 
Honasan and the RAM-HF core officers, who once enjoyed power 
under MND but lost it under the present dispensation. 

(13) Isleta and Biazon Testimonies, op. cit . BGen Isleta implied the 
existence of factions among the officer corps belonging to the 
PMA alumni, integrees and reservists. BGen Biazon considers 
the RAM, the loyalists, and the Young Officers Union (YOU) as 
the factions in the military.

BRIEF HISTORY OF THE 
FACT-FINDING COMMISSION 



(consisting of 21 pages) 



BRIEF HISTORY OF THE FACT-FINDING COMMISSION 



A* The Presidential Commission Under Administrative 
Order No. 146 

On 6 December 1989, or on the sixth day of the failed December coup, 
President Corazon C. Aquino issued Administrative Order No. 146 
creatinga Presidential Commission to conduct a fact-finding investigation 
of the 1989 rebellion and the involvement therein of military and civilian 
officials and private persons. 

The Presidential Commission was granted the powers of an 
investigating body under Section 37, Chapter 9, Book I of the 
Administrative Code of 1987, including the power to summon witnesses, 
administer oaths, take testimony or evidence relevant to the investigation, 
and issue compulsory processes to produce documents, books, records, 
and such other matters, in the performance of its functions. It could not, 
however, hold a witness in contempt without first applying for it 
before the appropriate court. It was authorized to engage the services 
of resource persons, professionals and other personnel, and to deputize 
the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), the National Bureau of 
Investigation (NBI), the Philippine Constabulary (PC), the Integrated ' 
National Police (INP), and any other law enforcing agency to assist it in 
the performance of its functions. 

To compose the Presidential Commission were Hilario G. Davide, Jr, 
a member of the 1986 Constitutional Commission and incumbent 
Chairman of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), as chairman; 
Carolina G. Hernandez, Professor and Director of the Center for 
Integrative and Development Studies (CIDS) of the University of the 
Philippines (UP); RicardoJ. Romulo,amemberofthe 1986 Constitutional 
Commission, a practicing lawyer and a business executive; Delfin L. 
Lazaro, a member of the Board of Regents of the UP, Chairman and 
President of Benguet Corporation (Benguet Corp) and a 1985 TOYM 
awardee; and Msgr Leonardo Legaspi, Archbishop of the Diocese of 
Nueva Caceres and President of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the 
Philippines, as members. The first four took their oath of office on 7 
December 1989. Msgr Legaspi declined the appointment. In his place, 
President Aquino appointed Christian S. Monsod, also a member of the 
1986 Constitutional Commission, National Co-Chairman of the Bishops- 



APPENDDC A 585 



Businessmen's Conference for Human Development, a 1975 TOYM 
awardee, and a business executive, who took his oath of office on 28 
December 1989. 

Administratively, the Presidential Commission was under the Office 
of the President. The latter was to provide the necessary funds for the 
Presidential Commission and the Executive Secretary was authorized to 
detail any personnel from any government office to assist the new body. 

The Presidential Commission setup its office in a 130-square meter 
area on the 11th floor of the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) 
Building in Makati, Metro Manila. This office space was temporarily 
vacated by some members of the DBP Board of Directors as a gesture of 
support for the Commission. 

Since time was of the essence, the Presidential Commission 
immediately began to function despite its lack of personnel and meager 
resources. It was able to equip itself with a vehicle, office equipment, and 
some pieces of furniture through the cooperation and support of the 
COMELEC, UP, DBP and Benguet Corp. Most of the equipment and 
furniture were furnished by Benguet Corp. For office supplies and 
miscellaneous expenses, the Office ofthe President established a revolving 
fund under the control and supervision of its own personnel who were 
detailed to the Presidential Commission. 

With a skeletal staff composed of 22 professionals from varied 
disciplines drawn mainly from other government agenaes «^«^» 
temporarily to the Presidential Commission it spent the next, 22 days ot 
its short existence formulating strategies, depubzing ™a«J^ J 
instrumentalities ofthe government to assist rt m the V»**™« 
its functions (such as the AFP, NBI, PC and INP), ^^J^* 
information, and drawing up a work program » 
gation. It established linkages with V^^^J^Sm 
institutions which were P°t-^ 

its investigation, and promulgated a res olutior * ^ * u ^ ft 
personal knowledge of facts or in possession of he 
coup attempt to testify before the 

evidence and requesting the Philippine Information Agency 
the resolution widest dissemination. 

Following the promulgation of its %«^j£S£Z£ 
13 December 1989, the and issued 

testimonial evidence m open pap ers or documents.

- Before the Presidential Commission was transformed into Oan 
independent Fact-Finding Commission, it had promulgated 22 retyi 
lutions, heard 40 witnesses in open and closed-door sessions, and 
obtained several records, papers or documents from other agencies or 
instrumentalities of the government Its last session to receive testimonial 
evidence was held on 5 January 1990. 

Based on the report of its Finance Officer, at the time of its 
dissolution the Office of the President had disbursed ^30,000 for the 
supplies and miscellaneous expenses of the Presidential Commission! 

B. The Fact-Finding Commission under Republic Act No. 6832 

From the start, the Presidential Commission created under 
Administrative Order No. 146 faced several constraints and issues. Its 
powers were insufficient to enable it to satisfactorily perform its tasks. 
The validity of its creation was raised by some witnesses it called. 
To resolve these issues, the President referred a bill to Congress 
investing the Commission with additional powers. This bill became 
House Bill No. 27761. In the Senate, however, the Committee; on 
Constitutional Amendments, Revision of Codes and Laws introduced 
Senate Bill No. 1391, which created an independent and non-partisan 
Commission to make a thorough investigation of all facts and 
circumstances surrounding the failed coup d'etat of December 1989 and 
to recommend measures to prevent the occurrence of similar attempts at 
violent seizure of power. " 

Congre ss was not able to approve th ese bill s before its 1989 Christmas 
recess. In view of their urgency, President Aquino called Congress taa 
special session. 

In its Special Session of 3 January 1990, Congress approved Republic 
Act No. 6832 (RA No. 6832) entitled An Act Creat ing A ^Tnmift" onTfl 
Conduct A Thorough Fart- Fin dim? Invfisti ration Of T hf EgflfidX^

Other Purposes. This Act is a consolidation of Senate Bill No, 1391ario 
House Bill No. 27761. It was approved and signed by the President on 
5 January 1990, and it took effect on 12 January 1990 following its 
publication in two national newspapers of general circulation. / 

The new Commission has since been known as the FACT-FINDING 
COMMISSION. President Aquino appointed to the new Commissi^; 
the Chairman and the Members of the Presidential Commission who, 
then took their oath of office on 12 January 1990. 



APPENDIX A 587 



B.l. Objectives and Powers 



Republic Act No. 6832 directs the Fact-Finding Commission to 
investigate all the facts and circumstances of the failed coup d'etat of 
December 1989, and recommend measures to prevent the occurrence of 
similar attempts at a violent seizure of power. To attain these objectives, 
it is empowered to (a) conduct a thorough fact-finding investigation of 
said coup and the involvement therein of military personnel and civilian 
personalities, including public officials and employees, evaluate all the 
facts and circumstances of the same and submit its findings and 
recommendations to the President, the Congress and other appropriate 
authorities not later than one year from the effectivity of the Act, (b) 
receive, review and evaluate the evidence adduced, andHo this end, 
summon witnesses, and administer oaths, take testimony or receive 
evidence relevant to the investigation, and to issue subpoenas ad 
testificandum or subpoenas duces tecum , (c) turn over to the appropriate 
prosecutorial authorities all evidence involving any person when in the 
course of its investigation it finds that there is reasonable ground to 
believe that he appears to be liable for a criminal offense in connection 
with said coup, and (d) ask the Monetary Board to disclose information 
on and/or to grant authority to examine any bank deposits, trust or 
investment funds, or banking transactions in the name of and/or utilized 
by aperson, natural or juridical, under investigation by the Commission, 
in any bank or banking institution in the Philippines, when the 
Commission has reasonable ground to believe that such deposits, trust 
or investment funds, or banking transactions have been used in support 
or furtherance of the objectives of said coup, and exercise such other acts 
incident to or are appropriate and necessary in connection with the 
objectives of the Act. 



B.2. Authority 

In order that it could effectively perform its powers and accomplish 
its objectives, the Act grants the Commission the authority to: 

1. Promulgate its rules and regulations. 

2 Call upon any government investigative and prosecutorial agency 
to make available their offices, personnel and facilities. 

3 Engage the services of such persons as may be required fix their 
" duties and compensation, organize the Commission s structure 

and staffing pattern and authorize the payment of honoraria 
anLrXwances 



588 



appointed, designated or deputized shall be exempt from Civil 
Service Law, rules and regulations. 

4. Hold any person in direct or indirect contempt and impose 
appropriate penalties. The Commission's judgment on direct 
contempt shall be final and not appealable. 

5. Grant immunity from criminal prosecution to any person who 
provides information or testimony in any investigation conducted 
by it when, upon evaluation, such information or testimony is 
necessary and vital to the investigation. 

Only the Supreme Court could issue any restraining order or 
preliminary injunction on any matter involving the official acts of the 
Commission and of the Monetary Board. 

The budget for the operations of the Commission was "P10 million, 
to be released automatically from the Contingent Fund. 

Furthermore, on 17 January 1990, the President issued Admi- 
nistrative Order No. 153 directing the departments, bureaus, offices, 
agencies or instrumentalities of the Government, including government- 
owned and controlled corporations, to extend assistance, support arid 
cooperation to the Commission created under RANo. 6832. In accordance 
with this Order, the DBP assigned four cars for use by the Commission. 

B.3. The Organization of the Commission and its Budget 

Section 14 of RA No. 6832 stipulates that the records, facilities, 
equipment, property, rights and such other things incidental to the 
creation of the Presidential Commission, including its employees, are to 
be absorbed by the new Commission to the extent that it is admi- 
nistratively feasible. To this effect, the Fact-Finding Commission 
immediately promulgated, on 12 January 1990, Resolution No. 001 
adopting the appropriate, relevant and pertinent Resolutions of the 
Presidential Commission. 

The first priority of the Commission was its immediate organization 
and its compensation plan. On 12 January 1990, it promulgated Reso- 
lution No. 002 which provides for its organizational structure, staffing 
pattern and compensation plan. 

Under its organizational structure, the Commission is made up of 
the Commission Proper, headed by the Chairman, supported by five 



APPENDIX A 589 



divisions with distinct functions. These divisions are the Office of the 
Commission Counsel, Office of Research, Evaluation and Publication, 
Administrative Services Division, Special Operations Division, and the 
Office of External Relations. 

Under the Office of the Commission Counsel are the Clerk of the 
Commission, the Deputy Commission Counsels and the Special Counsels. 

In addition to their functions of deliberating and deciding, en banc, 
on Commission policies and administrative matters, hearing testi- 
monies of witnesses, and submitting reports, the Commissioners act as 
Commissioners-in-charge of the separate divisions to oversee their 
activities. 

On 18 January 1990, the Commission submitted to the Office of the 
President and the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) its 
financial plan for the release of its appropriation. After 11 days, the 
Commission received the first release of its budget in the amount 
of 1*1,949,498 corresponding to 19 percent of its ^10 million appropria- 
tion. Subsequent releases that sum up tof*7.615 million as of 31 August 
were made every month according to the policy of the government. 

The mobilization of personnel who would occupy various positions in 
the organizational structure started on 12 January and by 31 May, 90 
percentoftherequirednumberofpersonnelhadbeen hired. Also, within 
14 days after initial release of the budget, 22 percent of the required ; 
equipment and furniture had been procured. 

The problem of office space was solved when the DBP Board of

rental rate. 

B.4. The Rules of Procedure of the Commission 



effective on 19 January 1990 following its publication in The Philipp^ 
Star and The Manila Standard on 17 January 1990. 



B.4.a. The Fact-Finding Investigation Process: Work Flow 

The fact-finding activities of the Commission were actually begun by 
its predecessor, the Presidential Commission, six days after it was 
organized under Administrative Order No. 146. All the evidence obtained 
by the latter was turned over to the form er. The Fact-Finding Commission 
substantially pursued the data and evidence-gathering plan of the 
Presidential Commission, under which it initially interviewed parties 
believed to have knowledge of or information on facts, persons or events 
pertaining to or connected with the December 1989 coup and pursued 
leads that may provide evidence on the coup. It also began evaluating 
coup-related information that was submitted by concerned citizens, as 
well as intelligence reports and information obtained from the intelligence 
agencies of the AFP. News reports covering the coup were also analyzed. 
It also gathered other resource materials such as studies, published 
articles, and books relating to coups. 

When the Fact-Finding Commission took over, it already had a list 
of probable witnesses whose testimonies it wanted to take and of 
documents, papers and records it wanted to obtain. 

Following Section 1 of Rule 7 of its Rules of Procedure, it obtained 
facts or evidence through oral testimonies, sworn statements or affidavits 
of parties whom it considered to have knowledge of any fact or to have 
possession of any evidence which may be pertinent, material or relevant 
for purposes of attaining the objectives of the Commission. 

Subpoenas ad testificandum were issued to witnesses for their 
appearances on specific dates. 

Oral testimonies of witnesses were received by the Commission en 
banc which, as a general rule, had to be in open session. Before 
testifying, witnesses were placed under oath and informed of their 
rights. The Commission Counsel, his Deputy or any of the Special 
Counsels conducted the examination of the witnesses. Members of the 
Commission, however, could ask questions for clarification or to elicit 
more facts. Closed-door sessions were allowed in the instances provided 
by RANo. 6832 and the Rules of Procedure of the Commission. In some 
cases, only sworn statements or affidavits were taken from subpoenaed 
witnesses by the Commission Counsel, the Deputy Commission Counsels 
or any of the Special Counsels of the Commission, which were thereafter 



APPENDIX A 591 



marked as Exhibits. In other instances, witnesses were subpoenaed for 
the confirmation or re-swearing of sworn statements or affidavits earlier 
given by them, which were likewise marked as Exhibits. 

Subpoenas duces tecum were issued for the production of documents, 
books, records and other papers which, upon their production, were 
marked Exhibits. 



Although the taking of depositions is one of the modes of obtaining 
evidence under the Rules of the Commission, no deposition was scheduled. 
The Commission relied principally on the other modes. 

Documents produced or identified during the reception of the 
testimony of a witness were also marked as Exhibits. 

The Commission also directed its Research, Evaluation and 
Publication Office to conduct research on coups using as its sources 
books, published articles, theses, position papers, surveys and other 
materials, many of which were similarly marked as Exhibits. Its 
research findings or recommendations were then submitted to the 
Commission. 

The Commission likewise decided to contract the services of respected 
and reputable social, political and economic scientists to undertake 
special studies on subjects relevant to coups, especially the December 
1989 failed coup. Their reports were later marked as Exhibits. Pursuant 
to its Resolution No. 066, it requested national civic, religious, political, 
professional, business, labor, media, communicators, youth, women 
veterans and other organizations to submit to the f^^^ 
respective position papers and/or memoranda, « mta ^. a q ^St 
of their role in preventing coups d'etat or s ™ llar ^^^ 
seizure of power and indicating the measures they 
prevent such attempts. Only a few, however, submitted their papers, 
which were then marked as Exhibits. 

All in all the Commission, in a total of 145 session days, heard in 
open^r^iS sessions the testimonies ; of 332 
Jok the sworn statements or 
sworn statements earlier executed, of a total or z 
subpoenaed for the purpose. Moreover, ^^^^^^ 



592 

pursuant to subpoenas duces tecum; and reports from special studies as 
well as position papers of various organizations. 

To formulate its reports, the Commission consolidated and analyzed 
the oral testimonies; documentary evidence, sworn statements and 
affidavits obtained from witnesses; its own research findings and 
recommendations; and the special studies done for it by scholars. It did 
this with the assistance of its Research, Evaluation and Publication 
Office. 

Before its Final Report, the Commission, pursuant to the second 
paragraph of Rule 14 of its Rules of Procedure, submitted to the 
President and Congress three Interim Reports, namely: 

1. Interim Report No. 1 entitled Observations AnH ^ rm -

In Chapter VI of the Final Report, to which this Brief History is 
appended, the Commission mentions the other military and civilian 



APPENDIX A 593 

personalities whom it recommends for prosecution, investigation or 
reinvestigation in connection with the failed December 1989 coup 
attempt. 

An illustration of the workflow of the fact-finding process of the 
Commission is provided at the end of this section. 

B.4.b Protection of Rights of Witnesses/Court Injunctions 

The Commission adequately protected the rights of witnesses who 
appeared before it. Rule 9 of the Rules touched on the right to remain 
silent, the right against self-incrimination and the right to counsel. 
Before a witness testified, the Commission took pains to inform him of 
his rights. Many of the military personnel who are under detention for 
alleged involvement in the failed December coup took full advantage of 
these rights. Aware of the peculiar cases of those already actively 
prosecuted by the military, the Commission adopted the following 
measures in its en banc meeting of 31 January 1990: 

1 Where a witness is already being actively prosecuted, to initially 
desistfromcallinghim. Instead, the Commission shall subpoena 
the evidence already presented against him and determine its 
sufficiency for the Commission's purpose. It should ™™™ T 
calling the witness to appearbefbre it only when it shall find that ; 
the evidence is insufficient for its purposes. 

2 When a witness had been charged or may be charged, he should 
be warnedbeforeheismade to testify before the Commission as 
follows: 

Under Section 7, RA No. 6832, you may be compelled by this 
Common tTgive testimony or produce evidence even if i »9^«d£ 
Sninate you or subject you to penalty or forfeiture; but * ^«^h a case, 
2fel«w prohibits the use of said evidence against you in any proceeding, 
except perjury in so testifying. 

However in order to take advantage of the immunity granted you in 

have any question? 

coined to answer a question from the Commission. 



There were civilian personalities, among whom were Enrique 
Cojuangco and Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr, who invoked their right to 
remain silent several times. 

Only in one instance was the Commission's ruling on the rights of 
witnesses judicially questioned. This was in the case of Senator Juan 
Ponce Enrile who was subpoenaed by the Commission to appear and 
testify before it. On the scheduled date for his testimony, 17 May 1990, 
Senator Enrile appeared but refused to testify; through counsel, he 
moved for the quashing of the subpoena. The motion having been denied 
on that date, and the written motion to reconsider the denial having been 
also denied on 30 May 1990, Senator Enrile filed on 15 June 1990 with 
the Supreme Court a petition for certiorari and prohibition with 
preliminary injunction/restraining order asking the Court to set aside 
the foregoing order of the Commission on the grounds that the 
Commission: 

1. Acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of 
discretion in coercing him to take the witness stand against his 
will and in violation of the Constitutional proscription against 
compelling a person to be a witness against himself. 

2. Interpretation of its mandate and powers under RA No. 6832 is 
not only at variance with the manifest legislative intent but also- 
exposes to attach on the ground of Constitutional infirmity. 

3. The various criminal cases against Senator Enrile, for his 
alleged involvement in the December 1989 coup attempt, are 
already subjudice and the Commission's attempt to compel 
Senator Enrile to take the witness stand against his will 
encroaches upon the exclusive prerogative of the judiciary in 
violation of the principle of separation of power. 

Although it had not given due course to the Enrile petition, the 
Supreme Court, in its en banc resolution of 19 June 1990, required the 
Commission to comment therein within ten days and issued a restraining 
order, effective immediately, ordering the Commission to cease and 
desist from enforcing the subpoena issued to petitioner and from holding 
the scheduled reception of his testimony on 22 June. 

On 29 June 1990, the Commission filed its comment. Thereafter, 
Senator Enrile filed a reply. According to its Resolution of 24 July 1990,s 
the Supreme Court gave due course to the petition. However, as of the 
time of the writing of this report, the Supreme Court has yet to resolve 
the issue presented. 



APPENDIX A 595 



B.4.c. Immunity to Witnesses 

There was no occasion for the Commission to grant immunity, as 
allowed in Section 7 of RA No. 6832, or transactional immunity under 
Section 8 of said Act as amplified in Rule 10 of the Rules of Procedure of 
the Commission, to any witness. Under said Rule, the Commission may 
grant immunity from criminal prosecution to any person who provides 
information and testifies in any investigation conducted by it where 
upon its evaluation, such information or testimony is necessary and vital 
to the investigation and it can be granted only if: 

1. The information or testimony he gives or offers is necessary and 

vital to the investigation conducted by the Commission. 

2. There is absolute necessity for such information or testimony. 

3 There is, at the time the testimony is to be taken, no direct 
evidence available for the purpose except such information or 
testimony. 

4. The information or testimony can be substantially corroborated 
in its material points. 

5. The witness does not appear to be the most guilty. 

6. The witness has not at any time been convicted of any offense 
involving moral turpitude.

Although Section 4 of RA No. 6832 was given one year from its 
effectivity to attain the objectives thereof and to turn over to the 
Department of Justice (DOJ) all its records, assets and properties within 
two months thereafter, in view of the early completion of its work, the 
Commission decided to immediately make the turnover. 

^ Realizing the need to preserve confidentiality of certain classes of 
documents, the Commission promulgated on 24 July 1990 Resolution 
No. 095 providing for the guidelines on the use, safekeeping and 
declassification of stenographic notes and tape recordings of testimonies 
taken m executive sessions and of the transcripts thereof. On 28 August

REPUBLIC ACT NO. 6832 



AN ACT CREATING A COMMISSION TO CONDUCT A THOROUGH 
FACT-FINDING INVESTIGATION OF THE FAILED COUP D' ETAT 
OF DECEMBER 1989, RECOMMEND MEASURES TO PREVENT 
THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR ATTEMPTS AT A VIOLENT 
SEIZURE OF POWER, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES 



Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
Philippines in Congress assembled: 

SECTION 1. Creation, Objectives and Powers - There is hereby 
created an independent Commission which shall investigate all the facts 
and circumstances of the failed coup d' etat of December 1989, and 
recommend measures to prevent similar attempts at a violent seizure of 
power. 

To attain these objectives, the Commission shall: 

(a) Conduct a thorough fact-finding investigation of the said coup d' 
etat and the involvement therein of military personnel and civilian 
personalities including public officials and employees, evaluate all the 
facts and circumstances of the same, and submit its findings and 
recommendations to the President, the Congress, and other appropriate 
authorities not later than one (1) year from the effectivity of this Act; 

(b) Receive, review and evaluate the evidence adduced and to this 
end, summon witnesses, administer oaths, take testimony or receive 
evidence relevant to the investigation, and to issue subpoena ad 
testificandum or subpoena duces tecum to produce documents, books, 
records and other papers; 

(c) Turn over to the appropriate prosecutorial authorities all evidence 



606 



involving any person when in the course of its investigation, the 
Commission finds that there is reasonable ground to believe that he 
appears to be liable for any criminal offense in connection with said coup 
d' etat; 

(d) Ask the Monetary Board to disclose information on and/or to 
grant authority to examine any bank deposits, trust or investment 
funds, or banking transactions in the name of and/or utilized by*a person, 
natural or juridical, under investigation by the Commission, in any bank 
or banking institution in the Philippines, when the Commission has 
reasonable ground to believe that said deposits, trust or investment- 
funds, or banking transactions have been used in support or furtherance 
of the objectives of the said coup d' etat; and 

(e) Exercise such other acts incident to or are appropriate and 
necessary in connection with the objectives of this Act.

^ *ABOUT THE BOOK . . . 

Nto On 6 December 1989, or on the sixth day of the failed December 
coup, President Corazon C. Aquino issued Administrative Order No. 146 
creating a Presidential Commission to conduct a fact-finding investigation 
of the 1989 rebellion and the involvement therein of military and civilian 
officials and private persons. 

To compose the Presidential Commission were Hilario G. Davide, 
Jr., as chairman; Carolina G. Hernandez, Ricardo J. Romulo, Dclfin L. 
Lazaro, and Msgr Leonardo Legaspi, as members. The first four took 
. their oath of office on 7 December 1989. Msgr. Legaspi declined the 
appointment. In his place, President Aquino appointed Christian S. 
Monsod, who took his oath of office on 28 December 1989. 

From the start, the Presidential Commission faced several constraints 
and issues. Its power were insufficient to enable it to satisfactorily 
perform its tasks. To resolve these issues, the President referred a bill 
to Congress investing the Commission with additional powers: 

In its Special Session of 3 January 1 990, Congress approved Republic 
Act No. 6832 entitled An Act Creatine A Commission To Conduct A 
Thorough Faet-Finding Investigation Of The Failed Coup D'etat Of 
December 1989. Recommend Measures To Prevent The Occurence Of 
Similar Attempts At A Violent Seizure Of Power. And For Other Purposes. 

The new Commission has since been known as the FACT-FINDING 
COMMISSION. President Aquino appointed to the new Commission the 
Chairman and the Members of the Presidential Commission who then 
took their oath of office on 12 January 1990. 



This is the final report of that Commission.
