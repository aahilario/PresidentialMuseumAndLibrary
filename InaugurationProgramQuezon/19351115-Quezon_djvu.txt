President of the Philippines 




CROSS THE FORBIDDING Sierra Madre Mountains 
lay, in 1889, forty miles of tortuous trails between the 
obscure village of Baler, Tayabas, and the nearest road to 
Manila. Along these, sometimes on horseback and some- 
times on foot, struggled a boy of eleven years and his father, Lucio 
Quezon. The purpose of their journey was to enter young Manuel in 
the College of San Juan de Letran, situated in the capital city. 

Symbolic of the seemingly insurmountable obstacles which he has 
since then overcome must be, in the mind of MANUEL L. QUEZON to- 
day, that first momentous journey of his childhood. His was a heritage 
of poverty and constant struggle, but also of inflexible purpose, a brilliant 
mind, and dauntless courage. He graduated from the College of San 
Juan de Letran and from the University of Santo Tomas with highest 
honors. As an officer in the Filipino Army during the Filipino— Amer- 
ican War, he rose swiftly from lieutenant of infantry to major. In 
the three years between 1903 and 1906 his ability and force of 
character carried him from the level of an almost unknown lawyer to 
the governorship of Tayabas, one of the richest provinces of the 
Archipelago. 

Election to the first Philippine Assembly in 1 907 was the next logical 
step in his career, to be followed, in 1909, by his selection as one of 
the two Resident Commissioners to the Congress of the United States, 
where he succeeded in obtaining for his country three vitally important 
concessions: in 1913, a Filipino majority in the Philippine Commission; 
in 1916, the surrender of all legislative rights to Filipinos by the estab- 
lishment of the Philippine Senate, of which he became the president; 
and the solemn pledge of independence for the Philippines from the 
Congress of the United States. 

The independence of the Philippines, possibly within the lifetime 
of Manuel L. Quezon, was now clearly assured as the result of the 
unceasing efforts which he had made toward this great national aspira- 
tion during those eight years in Washington. On May 1, 1934, 
the valiant battle which he had waged for nearly thirty years was 
crowned with glorious success when the Philippine Legislature accepted 
the Tydings-McDuffie Law, granting the Islands complete liberty ten 
years hence. 

Then, on September 17, 1935, the Filipino people bestowed upon 
him their greatest gift in electing him first President of the Philippines. 
From the obscurity of humble circumstances which attended his birth 
on August 19, 1878, he had risen, in 57 years, to a preeminence im- 
mortal in the hearts of his countrymen.

Seugio Osmena 

^ice President of the Philippines 



O THE SERVICE of his country Sergio Osmena has 
brought two sterling gifts of the pioneer — breadth and nobil- 
ity of vision and steadfast, indomitable courage. 

In 1900, before his admission to the bar, he was editor 
of the newspaper Nueoo Dia. New day! How prophetic of the future 
and symbolic of his vision were those words! 

His brilliant personality and outstanding ability as a constructive, 
sagacious leader early attracted the favorable attention of American 
administrators, and, in 1904, Luke E. Wright appointed him governor 
of his home province, Cebu. Two years later, in 1906, he was des- 
ignated fiscal for Cebu and Negros Oriental, and in the same year 
was elected Governor of Cebu. In October, 1906, although the 
youngest of all provincial executives in the Archipelago, he presided 
over the assembly of provincial governors held in Manila, and was 
elected chairman of that body. 

For a young man scarcely 28 years of age these were indeed dis- 
tinctive achievements. Nevertheless, his public career had only just 
begun, for, in 1907, he was elected Delegate to the first Philippine 
Assembly, and it was in the Assembly, as Speaker from 1907 until 19l6, 
that he performed, perhaps, his greatest patriotic service in so conduct- 
ing this legislative body as to make good the claim of the Filipino 
people to self-government. 

After the creation of the Philippine Senate in 1916, SERGIO OSMENA 
was urged by his friends to seek election as Senator, but this he could 
not bring himself to do until six years later, so great was his interest 
in the work of the Lower House and his loyalty to it, which he regarded 
in the light of a continuation, practically at least, of the Philippine 
Assembly. In 1 922, however, after remaining continuously in the House 
of Representatives as Speaker, he was elected Senator from the Tenth 
District, and has consistently served in this capacity until the present 
date, November 15, 1935. 

To-day he enters, in his 57th year, upon a new career of service 
to his country as Vice President of the Philippines, his early vision of 
the future of this nation almost realized, and the courage and faith which 
have sustained him throughout the long struggle toward national self- 
determination, rewarded.
