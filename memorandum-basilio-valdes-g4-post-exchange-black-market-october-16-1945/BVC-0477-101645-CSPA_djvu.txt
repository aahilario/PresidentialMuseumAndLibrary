MEMORANDUM for: G-A 

Colonel Townsend, USA, Chief, Post-Exchanges, AFITESPAC , has 
informed me today that the U. S . Army authorities are very much 
upset by the sale in big ouantibies of Post-Exchange articles in 
the black market. According to him, Philippine Army officers 
have been found selling these articles. 

It is desired that you submit a study or measures that we
