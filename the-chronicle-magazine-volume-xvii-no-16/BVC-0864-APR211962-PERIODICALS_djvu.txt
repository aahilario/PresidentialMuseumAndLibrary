Or. Souis lasagnes, on 
“pharmaceutical numbers 
racket”: "A new com- 

pound is touted as more 
potent than an older 
agent, because it can be 
given at a tenth of the 
dosage. Usually at these 
doses both drugs do the 
same incidence of unto- 
ward side reactions, so it 
is like saying a dime is 
more potent than two nic- 
kels.” 

robert frost, celebrated 
American poet, on poe- 
try: ‘‘Poems have points 
just as jokes have. There 
is something wrong about 
poetry with frills. Most 
of my thoughts have some 
reference to the U.S.A 
— terrible n a t i o nalism. 
The game is to play with 
thoughts and words 
You’ve got to make a 
point, find a phrase.” On

my wits.” 

Justice felix bautista an- 
gelo, on the employment 
aspect of the Retail Trade 
Nationa I i z a t i o n Act: 
“When the law says th-at 
you cannot employ an 
alien in any position per- 
taining to management, 
operation, administration 
and control, ‘whether as 
an officer, employee or 
laborer therein’... it 
meant that the employ 
ment of an alien even in 
a minor or clerical or nor 
control position was pro 
hibited. Opinion on this 
point was intended to 
plug any loophole ov 
close any avenue that an 
unscrupulous alien may 
resort to flout the law or 
defeat its purpose, for no 
one can deny that while 
one may be employed in 
a non-control position . 
he may later turn out to 
be a mere tool to furthe. 
the evil designs of the 
employer.”

THIS WEEK’S 

MAIL 



Sir: 

The Chronicle Magazine 
(Vol. XVII No. 11, March 17, 
1962 issue) is very useful and 
informative for me, and to 
shell collectors. In fact, a 
friend of mine desired to have 
a copy but failed to get one 
as none could be secured on 
the newsstands here • I got a 
copy and I saved it in order 
to know or identify my shell 
collection. I am a beginner 
though in shell collecting. I 
just hope you could continue 
the publication of our colorful 
Philippine shells in your maga- 
zine. I admired the work of 
the author and the photo- 
graphic work of S. Enriquez, 
Jr. Hope to see some more 
of their work in the succeed- 
ing issues of your magazine.

Sir: 

In the first of the series of 
my article, “City in the Sky- 
land” TMarch 24), you missed 
to print the first paragraph 
which composed of only a sen- 
tence, but essential just the 
same. The sentence ran: “Take 
a mountain top." 

This was the alliteration 
which was referred to in the 
second paragraph which be- 
came the first in the published 
article. I have been asked time 
and again about this and it 
left me feeling a little bit silly- 
speaking of an alliteration 
that wasn’t there. 

I do hope you’ll publish this, 
if nothing else but to explain 
what I meant, or if you care 
even just a wee bit about my 
feeling a little bit silly. 

LINA ESP I N A-M OO RE 



Sir: 

We protest for making it 
appear that Congressman Ben- 
jamin T. Ligot is from Pam- 
panga. (See TABLE TALK. Tin* 
Chronicle Magazine, March 10. 
1962). Actually he is the fight- 
ingest congressman that the 
province of Cagayan ever had. 
In the last elections he was 
reelected hands down for his 
achievements in the Second 
District of Cagayan and for his 
independence of conviction in 
Congress. More power to Con- 
gressman Ben T. Ligot.

by Major General BASILIO J. 



ABOUT a couple of weeks ago, our country com- 
memorated the fall of Bataan, an event which pro- 
duced consternation and sadness in the hearts of 
Filipinos and Americans alike, but brought into 
the front page of newspapers of the free world 
the important fact that the Filipinos who had 
received insufficient training in the pre-war days, 
and who had been described as mere boys too 
young to fight, were transformed in the face of 
danger into fighters second to none in the world. 
It seems incredible that this short word consisting 
only of six letters could become in the brief space 
of four months, the shibboleth of all freedom-loving 
peoples of the democratic nations. 

When the Japanese made; their dastardly at- 
tack on Pearl Harbor and the Philippines on De- 
cember 8, 1941, General Douglas Mac Arthur, who 
had been named Commander-in-Chief of the United 
States Armed Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) 
on July 27, was still training Philippine Army 
troops and building up enough force to be able 
to repel the enemy. General MacArthur was cri’ 
ticized several times for his earnest desire to make 
tough soldiers out of young men from civilian life 
in the brief space of six months.- Douglas Mac- 
Arthur knew t^ie Filipinos. He was their friend, 
and they were his. With the admirable coolness 
of a seasoned leader of men, he answered his 
critics: “You fools, the Filipinos are brave people 
and will use their arms for America if ever the 
time shall come.” The combined Filipino and 
American forces held out magnificently in Bataan 
and Corregidor for virtually six months, denying 



Manila Bay to an enemy that was frantic to use 
the Manila docks as staging areas in - carrying its 
attacks to the South Seas. That six-month period 
of successful delaying action was precisely the task 
set for the Filipino-American forces in the Original 
Orange* Plan for the defense of the Philippines. 
In the Orange JPlan, the U.S. Navy* was supposed 
to lift the siege of the Philippine within six 
months. 

MacArthur’s Aggressive Plan 

This War Plan Orange-3 (WPO-3) had been 
in existence since 1938, but was revised in April 
1941. U.S. Army planners in early 1941 believed 
that at the end of six months, if not sooner, sup' 
plies would be exhausted and the Filipino-American 
troops would go down in defeat. WPO-3 did not 
make any provision for this, and everyone hoped 
that when the time came, something would be 
done from the United States to relieve or rescue 
the troops across the Pacific. General MacArthur 
had the answer to those who belonged to the de- 
featist group. His plan was to transform the pure- 
ly defensive WPO-3 into an aggressive plan whose 
object would be the defeat of any enemy that 
would attempt the conquest of the Philippines. An 
optimist by nature, General MacArthur had im- 
plicit faith in the Filipino people and their will- 
ingness to fight and die in the defense of the prin- 
ciples of Democracy that had been established in 
the Philippines by the American people. His op- 
timism was so contagious that soon he was able 
to inspire the confidence and loyalty of the mem' 




VALDES 



bers of his staff, and develop in them the firm 
conviction that given sufficient time, a Japanese 
attack could be successfully resisted. 

To carry out liis aggressive plan, MacArthur 
felt that he could rely on his growing air force 
which included by the end of November 1941, 
thirty-five B-l7’s and almost 100 fighters of the 
latest type. Many more were supposed to be on 
the way. He also knew that he could count on 
the ten reserve divisions of the Philippine Army, 
then being mobilized and trained, and one regular 
division. In September 1941, he informed General 
Wainwright of his intention to reorganize the forces 
in the Philippines. However, on October 1941, he 
received from Washington a new war plan, Rain- 
bow-5, prepared by the Joint Board of Chiefs of 
Staffs. This new plan accepted implicitly the loss 
of the Philippines, Wake and Guam. Like the 
Orange plan, it assigned Army and Navy forces in 
the Philippines the mission of defending the Phil- 
ippine Coastal Frontier defined as those land and 
sea areas which would be necessary to hold in or- 
der to defend Manila and Subic bays. Also, as in 
Orange, this new defense plan was to be conducted 
entirely by Army and Navy forces already in the 
Philippines, augmented by such forces of the Phil- 
ippine Army as were available. No reinforcements 
could be expected. MacArthur immediately object- 
ed to that provision of the Rainbow plan relating 
to the Philippines, on the ground that it failed to 
recognize either the creation of a high command 
for the Far East or the mobilization of the Phil- 
ippine Army. In a strong letter to the War De-

partment on October 1, he urged that the citadel 
type defense of Manila Bay provided in the Orange 
and Rainbow plans be changed to an active de- 
fense of all the islands in the Philippines. 

The reply from General Marshall came prompt- 
ly. On November 3, 1941, General Brereton, com 
mander of the Air Forces in the Philippines, ar- 
rived from Washington with the news that Mac- 
Arthur’s plan would be approved. Like a little 
boy, MacArthur jumped from his chair, and enr 
bracing General Brereton and General Sutherland, 
exclaimed happily: “They are going to give us 

everything we have asked for!” Approval by the 
Joint Board of the Rainbow revision requested by 
General MacArthur was forwarded from Washing- 
ton on November 21, 1941. In the accompanying 
letter, General Marshall told MacArthur to go 
ahead with his plans “on the basis of your inter- 
pretations of the basic war plan.” This gave Mac- 
Arthur authority to defend all of the Philippine 
Islands. It also provided specifically for a defense 
reserve for 180 days instead of the ninety days 
originally granted to General Grunert. These addi- 
tional tasks recognized the existence of an effec- 
tive air force in the Philippines capable of strik- 
ing at Japanese lines of communications and bases 
such as Formosa, and the fact that the Philippine 
Army had been inducted into the federal service 
by including it with forces available to accomplish 
the tasks assigned. 

- Sunday, December 7, 1941 was a normal day, 
nothing ominous in the atmosphere, no forebodings 
' or shadows cast by coming events. That night the 
27th Bombardment Group gave a party in the 
Manila Hotel, a gala affair- in honor of General 
Brereton. Rear Admiral William R. Purnell and 
Brig. General Richard K. Sutherland attended, and 
in their intimate conversation, Admiral Purnell told 
them that it would only be a question of days or 
perhaps hours until the shooting started. Sutherland 
confirmed that the War and Navy Department in 
Washington believed that hostilities might begin at 
any time. Most officers and men, and most peo- 
ple in Manila went to bed that night with no pre- 
monition that the next day would be drastically 
different from the last. Many people remembered 
that before retiring they had turned on the radio 
and listened to Tchaikowsky’s Concerto in B Flat 
Minor, the poignant music of that well-known com- 
poser on* that last night of peace. 

The Enemy’s Plan of Conquest 

The Japanese war plan consisted first on air 
operations to begin on the morning of X-Day when 
planes of the Japanese Army’s 5th Air Group and 
the Navy’s 11th Air Fleet would strike American 
Air Forces- on Luzon. These attacks would continue 
until American air strength had been destroyed. 
When the major part of American air strength had 
been eliminated, the main force of the 14th Army 
under General Homma was to land along Linga- 
yen Gulf, while another force would land at La' 
mon Bay, southeast of Manila. These forces with 
close air support were to advance on Manila from 
the north and south. It was expected that the de- 
cisive engagement of the campaign would be fought 
around Manila. Once the capital was taken, the is- 
lands defending the entrance to Manila Bay were 
to be captured and Luzon occupied. 

The Imperial General Headquarters and the 
Southern Army expected General Homma to com- 
plete his mission in about fifty days. At the end of

Consideration for the men, disease -ridden and weakened by starvation and totally incapable 
of the sustained physical effort necessary for a successful defense, more than any 
military condition or inability to stave off enemy advance, forced the surrender at Bataan 



that time, about half of the 14th Army, as well 
as the Army and Navy air units were to leave the 
Philippines for operations in the south. The re- 
maining elements of the 14th Army were then to 
occupy the Visayas and Mindanao. The Japanese 
considered it essential to the success of their mili- 
tary operations to gain complete victory before the 
end of March 1942. The Japanese knowledge of 
the American defense plans was faulty. They never 
thought that the Americans would withdraw to the 
Bataan peninsula. 



The difficulty of penetrating the Japanese block- 
ade and getting supplies to Corregidor and Ba- 
taan caused the military situation to deteriorate. 
The half rations issued since January 11, 1942 
had been further reduced by the end of March, 
and horses and mules were being slaughtered for 
food. This situation was greatly aggravated by the 
fact that thousands of Filipino civilians had ac- 
A rmy into the Bataan, peninsula 



In February 1942, General MacArthur was or- 
dered by the War Department to proceed imme- 
diately to Australia to assume command of the new- 
ly designated Southwest Pacific Area. His directive 
from the Combined Chiefs of Staffs included the 
missions ofjholding Australia, checking the enemy’s 
advance along the Melanesian Barrier, protecting 
land, sea and air communications with the South- 
west Pacific,* and maintaining over position in the 
Philippines. Lieutenant General Jonathan M. Wain- 
wright succeeded General MacArthur as comman- 
der of the forces in the Philippines and continued 
the gallant defense ^which has become an epic in 
the Filipino and American histories. 

On March 31, the Japanese initiated the an- 
ticipated general assault on the Bataan position, an 
attack relentlessly maintained during the next seven 
days. As the Filipino and American lines were fi- 
nally penetrated and field hospitals were shelled 
by Japanese artillery, in complete disregard of the 
large Red Crosses painted on the roofs, it became 
apparent that the courageous but exhausted defend- 
ers could no longer avoid disaster. 



A Black Good Friday 



Friday, 3rd of April was not only the day Hom- 
ma had selected to open the final offensive; it 
was also a religious holiday for Christian Filipino 
and American soldiers, and a national holiday for 
the Japanese. For the Christian defenders, it was 
the Friday of Holy Week, and the more devout 
spent the anniversary of the Crucifixion with pray- 
ers and fasting.* For the Japanese attackers on the 
3rd of April marked the anniversary of the death 
of the legendary Emperor Jimmu, the first ruler 
to sit on the imperial throne. On that Good Fri- 
day the sun rose in a cloudless sky. The unrelent- 
ing sun was like an open furnace glaring in the 
sky. Everything was dry. Even the eyes of the 
Angels in Heaven, who had cried so much for 
our fallen heroes were dry. They had no more 




tears to shed. From the top of Mt. Samat two 
American officers serving as artillery observers saw 
batteries of artillery and about ten mortar bat- 
teries two or three miles behind the Japanese lines. 
In addition General Mikami’s air force dropped 
more than sixty tons of bombs. The combined air- 
artillery bombardment had a devastating effect. So 
violent, thunderous and continuous were the explo- 
sions that it seemed as if all hell had broken loose. 
Previously constructed defenses, telephone lines and 
artillery positions were knocked out and destroyed. 



THE AUTHOR <was at the war's outbreak chief 
of staff of the Philippine Army and Secretary 
of the National Defense, it was he who, delegated 
by General MacArthur, took President Quezon and 
his family by submarine from Corregidor to Aus- 
tralia, and thence to the United States. A mem- 
ber of President Quezon's war cabinet at Wash- 
ington, D.C., he saw action during the war years, 
and returned to the Philippines with General Mac- 
Arthur and the American liberation forces. 

No Alternative But Surrender 

When late in the evening of April 8, General 
Wainwright ordered a counter-attack by the First 
Corps in the direction of Olongapo, General King 
had already reached the conclusion that he had 
no alternative but to surrender. By that time all 
chances of halting the Japanese advance, much less 
launching a successful counter-attack, was gone. 
Even if General King had been able at the last 
moment to muster enough arms and men to op- 
pose the Japanese advance, it is extremely doubt- 
ful that he could have averted or even delayed 
the final disaster. The men on Bataan had been 
already defeated for almost one week. Disease and 
starvation r a t h e r than nlilitary conditions had 

# 

the chronicle magazine / april 21, 1962 j jy 



created the situation in which General King now 
found himself. Three months of malnutrition, ma- 
laria and intestinal infections had left them weak 
and disease-ridden, totally incapable of the sus- 
tained physical effort so necessary for a success^ 
ful defense. 

When on the afternoon of April 7, General 
King saw the situation very critical, he sent his 
Chief of Staff, General Funk, to Corregidor, to 
inform General Wainwright that the fall of Ba- 
taan was imminent and that he might have to sur- 
render. On his decision rested the responsibility 
for the fate of the 78,000 men on Bataan. Although 
Wainwright shared King’s feelings about the plight 
of the men on Bataan, his answer to Funk was 
based upon the orders he had received from Gen- 
eral MacArthur which prohibited surrender under 
any conditions. In his order, General MacArthur 
directed Wainwright that if food failed, to prepare 
and execute an attack upon the enemy, .and. em- 
phasized that he was utterly opposed, under any 
circumstances or conditions, to the ultimate capitu- 
lation 'of his command. “If it is to be destroyed,” 
he added, “it should be upon the actual field of 
battle taking full toll from the enemy.” Further- 
more, on Wainwright’s desk was the message of 
President Roosevelt, dated February 9, in which 
the words “No Surrender” were emphatically writ-* 
ten. 

The only alternative remaining to King if he 
followed Wainwright’s orders, was to accept the 
wholesale slaughter of his men without achieving 
any military advantage. At just what point in those 
last hectic days of the Battle of Bataan General 
King made his decision is not exactly known. At 
eleven o’clock at night of April 8, General King 
saw that it was impossible to reinforce the last 
thin line of General Bluemel, and that there was 
nothing to prevent the enemy from reaching the 
congested area to the south. It was at this time 
that General King reviewed the tactical situation 
very carefully with his staff officers and considered 
all possible lines of action. With no relief in sight 
and with no possible chance to delay the enemy, 
General King then decided to open negotiations 
with the Japanese for the conclusion of hostilities 
in Bataan. He made this decision entirely on his 
own responsibility and with the full knowledge that 
he was acting contrary to General Mac Arthur’s 
orders. At midnight he called his entire staff to 
his tent to inform them of his decision. Further 
resistance, he told them, would only be an un- 
necessary and useless waste of life. “I have not 
communicated with .General Wainwright,” he de- 
clared, “because I do not want him to be com- 
pelled to assume any part of the responsibility.” 
When the officers left King’s tent, all eyes were 
full of tears. 

It was at six o’clock in the morning of April. 
9 when General Wainwright learned from Lt. Colo- 
nel Jesse T. Traywick, Jr., that General King had 
sent an officer to the Japanese to .arrange terms 

continued

for the cessation of hostilities. Shocked, he shouted 
to Colonel Traywick: “Go back and tell him not 
to do it.” But it was too late. Immediately he 
radioed General MacArthur the terrible news and 
finished his message with these words: “Physical 
exhaustion and sickness due to a long period of 
insufficient food is the real cause of this terrible 
disaster.” 

For General King, General Wain wright had no 
criticism. He later told General MacArthur: “The 
decision which King was forced to make required 
unusual courage and strength of character.” 

A Courageous End 

At 12:30 noon of April 9, King finally agreed 
to surrender unconditionally. The battle of Bataan 
had ended. The fighting was over. The men who 
had survived the long ordeal could feel justly 
proud of their courage, patience and loyalty and 
of their accomplishments. To many not familiar 
with military operations, the battle of Bataan must 
have seemed a terrific defeat. To those of us who 
fought and knew what we were fighting for, Ba- 
taan was a decisive victory, the beginning of V-J 
day. The resistance made by the Filipino and 
American troops against the superior strength of 
the enemy forces had developed into an epic of 
courage and tenacity. The enemy avoided bloody 
frontal assaults and resorted to landings on the 
westcoast behind Filipino-American lines, or at- 
tempted penetration raids, only to be liquidated. If 
only help had reached the Philippine in time, the 
story would have been much different. 

To General Homma, Bataan was not a victory 
but a defeat. As Bataan continued to resist and 
hold on, Homma wondered why Hongkong had 
fallen in two weeks and Singapore in two months. 
The resistance of the Filipino-American forces was 
so effective that General Sugyama, the Chief of 
. Staff, Japanese Imperial Headquarters, personally 
flew to the Philippines to investigate. He realized 
that Bataan could not be taken with the troops 
under General Homma. The Imperial Headquar- 
ters then ordered to the Philippines additional 
troops and artillery units from China, and several 
aerial bombardment groups from Burma. 

To all freedom-loving Filipinos, Bataan remained 
as a symbol of loyalty, bravery and devotion, which 
encouraged them to continue their resistance 
throughout the archipelago in preparation for Mac- 
Arthur’s promise: “I shall return.”. 

Of the surrender on Bataan, General MacAr- 
thur said: “The Bataan forces went out as it 

would have wished, fighting to the end of its 
flickering, forlorn hope. No army has ever done 
so much with so little, and nothing became it 
more than its last hour of trial and agony.” 

The gallantry of the Filipino soldiers in Ba- 
taan and Corregidor has earned for the Philip- 
pines the priceless right to be recognized on its 
own merit as an equal in the brotherhood of arms 
in the nations of the world. After the fall of Ba- 
taan many have been the words of praise lavished 
on those young heroes of the battle of Bataan. But 
words become feeble in the needs of the moment, 
in the crying challenge for action. For Bataan 
was not only a symbol: It was a challenge. That 
challenge has been answered wherever Democracy 
is still a living symbol. Bataan was indeed not the 
end. It was only the beginning, the prelude to 
ultimate Victory — Our Victory. 




AFTER WEIGHING THE CRITICAL SITUATION AT BATAAN, GENERAL KING ARRIVES AT DECISION TO SURRENDER UNCONDITIONALLY.

Killer Volcano Now Nurtures Life 

Belief has it that Taal having spent its climactic fury, is no longer geared to kill but to offer life 



photography J JOSE T. DEL ROSARIO 



PERHAPS Taal’s way of compensating for its 
past misdeeds is by offering the people living 
around it the richness of its volcanic soil and the 
beauty of its scenic spots. Taal has been recorded 
in local history as the greatest local killer of all 
time. One remembers that its 1911 eruption de- 
molished and formed large bodies of water in its 
vicinity, killed some 1,400 people in the wink of 
an eye and caused damages to home and pro, 
perty over a radius of twenty miles. From 1572 
to 1911, Taal Volcano recorded more than a few 



dozen devastating and horrific eruptions. These de- 
pleted the population to ten per cent, buried towns, 
found wastelands rich with plant and animal life, 
and made and unmade lakes in its vicinity. 

A half century has passed since its last erup- 
tion, and there is no way of knowing whether the 
volcano is ready again to rain its death-dealing 
lava. The consensus of opinion, however,, is that 
it has already spent its climactic iury and that 
all that can be expected of it is its terrific yield 



of richness of soil and the abundance of fish in 
its lakes for many centuries to come. The trace 
of all its past killings have almost been effaced 
by its life-giving capabilities. The lakes that it has 
formed have an inexhaustible supply of poultry and 
fish. The land around it nurtures sugar, citrus 
fruits, coconuts and a wealth of vegetables which 
are marketed to Manila and its suburbs. In the 
constant struggle for survival, Taal folk live on 
Taal’s bounty, enlivened further by the breath- 
taking scenes that greet their eyes . — rva

WRITIN6 

IN 



WRHTONG SN AMERICA, as edited by John 
Fischer and Robert B. Silvers, compiles the cri- 
tical studies of American writings by writers 
like Alfred Kazin, Budd Schulberg, Archibald 
MacLeish, Frank Yerby and many others. We 
would not like to commit ourselves by criticiz- 
ing criticisms. Each critic has his own salty 
tang here which he showers on book authors 
irregardless of what others may say or think. 
We will just quote the quo tables or representa- 
tive writings that strike 
our fancy as true. Al- 
fred Kazin in his THE 
ALONE GENERA- 
TION: “But I must ad- 
mit that the great ma- 
jority of stories I read 
in magazines seem only 
stitehings and joinings 
and colorings of some 
original model. No won- 
der that in so much 
contemporary fiction we 
are excited by the in- 
tention and tolerate the achievement/ Robert 
Brustein in WHY AMERICAN PLAYS ARE NOr 
LITERARY: “A successful playwright today may 
think of himself as a craftsman, an entertainer, 
even a creative artist, but only in very rare 
cases would he call himself a literary man . . . 
In his subject matter, his writing style, his 
association, his attitudes, and his ideas, the dra- 
matist is far removed, if not completely cut off. 
from the mainstream of intellectual and literary 
discourse." Budd Schulberg in THE WRITER 
IN HOLLYWOOD: “I put in a frustrated ap- 
prenticeship writing scenes that somehow were 
sandwiched into other writers’ scripts, or full 
shooting scripts that were never read, or screen 
plays which would be rewritten by teams of 
competent drones until the film that finally 
emerged was a three-headed monster that star- 
tled me by occasionally speaking one of my 
lines or play-acting a whole intact chunk hacked 
out of one of my scenes."

THE GENIUS OF AMERICA, by Saul K. Pado- 
ver, is a study of men who moulded the United 
States of America into what it is today. Presi- 

dents from Washington 
to Roosevelt, philoso- 
phers like Emerson, 
John Dewey and Wil- 
liam James, poets like 
Whitman and writers 
like Thoreau are rep- 
resented here. Each 
study is worth reading 
for its biographical and 
historical incidence, for 
its wholesome and easy 
reading pleasure, and 
for its anecdotal inte- 
rest. The book is preferably written for the 
mass of readers who definitely have no pa- 
tience for the dictionary and literature.— rva

THE Greatest Story Ever Told will be the de- 
finitive film on ' the Christ story, according to 
George Stevens, the producer-director. Stevens is 
leaving no stone unturned in his effort to make 
the picture, based on the book by Fulton Oursler, 
historically accurate in the terms of Judaeo-Chris- 
• tian religion as well as the history of the times. 
To this end, Stevens has spent more time and 
money in the pre-production period than most 
films cost to produce in their entirety. Before a 
camera turns, over $3,000,000 will be spent and 
the Stevens production team has been working to- 
gether well over a year. . .it will be nigh onto two 
years before actual filming. 

Housed in their own building, the Stevens 
Company pre-production team sent crews to scour 
the Holy Land and Italy to gather all possible 
data, recorded thousands of feet of sounds, and 
consulted with famous poet Carl Sandburg on the 
story. Stevens explains the meticulous attention to 
detail as follows: 

“I want to take an entirely new look at this 
story. I want to bring out the story of Jesus and 
His thinking and Philosophy. The more I get in- 
to this thing, the more I become aware of the 
fact that the story is so little known — people have 
concepts of it, other people have more detailed 
knowledge, but very few have any idea of the 
chronology and actual development. They don’t 
get it in church, it’s non sequitur and disjointed 
from Sunday to Sunday. 

“In our picture, we want the audience to come 
out of the theater with a good idea of the real 
story of Jesus, a story that has been meticulously 
checked out and researched, but is not doctrinaire. 
That is, a story that is told as theater, with thea- 
ter ideas, and, we hope, entertainingly. I think it 
would be a thrill to be able to see that Christ 
story told like this. The story in all its simplicity 
and drama but without the theater" legends that 
have crept into it from centuries of Passion Plays. 
No Salome dances, for example. The story of 
Christ is less widely known than most people 
realize. I want this story told; told simply, with- 
out embellishments. To this end. we have spent al- 
most three years in preparing a script.” 

BEHIND Tony van Renterghen are some of the 
more than 50,000 books that researcher van Ren- 
terghen has distilled into twenty concise volumes 
(middle ground) on the life and times of Christ. 
Each of these research digests including the Hex- 
apals and the Four Gospels Analysis, are indexed 
in a slim booklet (foreground) so that even the 
most minute details may be quickly checked by 
anyone connected, with making the movie. 








AMERICAN officer sounds out drafted college boy, 
Luis de la Serna, asks if he could be, after Nor. 
wan Reyes, voice behind 'The Voice of Freedom.” 




CROUCHED in a foxhole on Corregidor, Luis and 
his pal Pepe discuss critical situation at Bataan, 
immanent surrender,; death and the after-life. 




NUN tries to help bring about a meeting between 
the two young people. Teresa is overjoyed, kisses 
nun. But then, Luis is drafted into the army. 




LUIS dies at concentration camp. Teresa prays and keeps on praying . . . Someday in heaven they'll, meet 



and that lonely little rock jutting up out of the 
Bay, beaten and battered from land, sea and air, 
while in Manila Teresa knelt and prayed. 

Luis was the Voice of Freedom and she sat in 
the dark, in the blackout, listening to every word. 

It was the passion and death of the Common- 
wealth. It was the scourging at the pillar for Luis, 
and for the thousands of Filipino boys like him. It 
was the agony in the garden for Teresa. 

Bataan fell, and Corregidor. 

Luis, staggering on the death march, wounded, 
falling and getting up again, while Teresa prayed. 

The carrying of the cross, and the woman 
watching from the hill. 

The voice of Wainwright echoing through the 
streets: “I have surrendered for the forces in Luzon 
... I beg you to lay down your arms. I have sur- 
rendered for the forces in Mindanao. . . I beg you 
to lay down your arms.” 

The names in the paper of those who were 
released. 

The agonizing wail for the resurrection from 
the dead. 

The girl in the lonely room, with the rosary, 
waiting for the dead to return. 

The Woman on Holy Saturday, with the crown 
of thorns, and the nails. 

Written for this day, Holy Saturday, in this 
city, Manila— .-the author did not create the story. 
He merely recorded it. The lives , were written by 
Bert Hathaway, but the Veal composer of this little 
drama was God. 

the chronicle maflaxlne / april 21, 1962 f 99 



End 

Cecilia Guidote, who graduated just this March 
from Saint Paul’s College, summa cum laude and 
with two degrees, plays the young Teresa. Her 
friend is Maribel Carceller, fresh from her starring 
role in Family Theater’s Four Women . The nun, 
who tries to help Teresa, is Milagros A. Gomez, 
presently teaching at American School. 

Jose Avelino is Luis, with Manny Palao as his 
friend in the foxhole, and with Phi! Nichols of the 
Peace Corps as his American ranking officer. Bob 
Tyler, whose job during the day is the rejuvenation 
of boys at Welfareville, plays the priest. 

Armando Goyena, after a long absence from 
stage and screen, comes back as Teresa’s father. 
The role comes naturally. He has six girls of his 
own, each one prettier than the other. 

It is a strange love story, that truly happened, 
in the streets of the city. 

It is the story of a great people, long accus- 
tomed to suffering, jn one of the saddest and 
proudest moments of their history. 

It is the passion of Christ, reflected in the face 
of the Philippines. 

It is Holy Saturday. 

It is April in Manila, twenty years ago. 

As the little girl says, kneeling before the cru- 
cifix: "... but You rose again, didn’t You? And 

You met Your mother And that’s how it will 

be, won’t it? We’ll meet - . . for the very first time 
. . where there is no more suffering, and no more 
tears. I can wait... till then... Goodnight, Luis.”

CARL SANDBURG (above) has been hired by George Stevens to assist on the writing 
of the script of the Greatest Story Ever Told. Stevens: “Mr. Sandburg’s most impor-

job that calls for inspirational writing and Carl's humane and Olympian point of view, 
his poetry, his poetic sense of conversation have made a profound contribution.

TO production manager, Tom Andre, the Greatest Story Ever Told means the most formidable task of his thi rty-y ear career. 

For the past two years and for the next year to come, Tom Andre will be responsible for the expenditure of every single one 

of the $15 to $20 million that the Greatest Story Ever Told will cost. And, if Tom Andre seems to be guarding the pile of 

money in his care, it is because he knows that in movie-making it is a simp’e matter to spend an extra million dollars 

or two unless he keeps an iron grip on the purse strings. He keeps a daily track of production by means of 300 forms. continued

Never before has research work of vast dimensions on the life and time 



of the Christ been undertaken by a movie production team to turn 
out a motion picture that will be as historically accurate as possible 





HERE are closeups of just three of the paintings 
that are part of the collection of the Stevens re- 
search department. They are all images of Christ. 



Stevens, after having compared them all, will 
choose one, or a combination of several, to form 
the likeness which will eventually be seen on the 



screen, in his film. The part of Jesus Christ, 
easily acting's most challenging role, will be por- 
trayed in film by Swedish actor, Max Vonsydow.
