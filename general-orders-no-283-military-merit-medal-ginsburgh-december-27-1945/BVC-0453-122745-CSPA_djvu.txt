4 

Colonel Robert Ginsburgh 0-S747 G-SC, USA. Por meritorious service ren- 
dered to the Commonwealth Government during the period from 28 December 1944 
to 9 June 1S45. On 28 December 1944, Colonel Ginsburgh was placed in charge 
of Civil Affairs, G-5, in. the United States Services of Supply in the Base 
K ire a. At that timo the administration Of Civil Affairs In the Philippines 
was in its infancy. However, 'he assumed his duties with determination and 
enthusiasm, selected key officers and men, and established a Civil Affairs 
Section for the Base X at facloban, Leyte. This was the first Civil Affairs 
Section of its land in the Philippines. The G-5 Section of USASOS, under 
1 the leadership of Colonel Ginsburgh, placed all the resources- of his command 
behind the effort to restore civil government and assist the civilians in 
every way as rapidly as possible. So successful was - the effort in the Base K 
area An Leyte that it was used as a model for other Base areas taken over 
by USnSOS. The rapid and smooth return to normal conditions in these Base 
areas were., in a largo measure, attributable to the wise leadership and di- 
rection of Colonel Ginsburgh, and his sympathetic and interested attitude 
toward the people of the Philippines,
