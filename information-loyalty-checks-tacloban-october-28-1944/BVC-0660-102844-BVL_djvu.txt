QUOTE QUOTE 

XXX 

’Our neadu uarters uas transferred from Jaro to Palo, so I use to 
s ay now in Palo, xou Know I don’t stay in a permanent place I go 
froa one town to otner towns, as I am connected with the Intelli- 
gence Division we’ve got to go to any pluce we want. But we use to 
go back to Palo after 2 or 3 weeks from inspection tour, I don’t 
lave any manual laoor at all. I’m always dressed very well, some- 
times I do the interpreting, investigat ng and if we don’t have 
anybody .to be investigated I only go around and hear anything I 
can inform thei£. My work is like the work of Mr. Abella. I 
received a regular salary of P60.00 a month. Sometines I received 
all in all around f*180«00 a month* But ray average per month is 
P150.00 a month. But I spend a lot here, cigarettes and eats are 
very dear here, cigarettes is P.80 a piece here. Of course my 
board and food is free. I can sometines bujr a fev; pieces of clothes, 
Even now T got f5ve pairs of shoes now. I got my friends from 
all the towns I’ve some. They use to approach mo in the cases 
connected wit the army. They have learned to like me. They alwavs 
ask me what I need.”
