Mrs. Aurora A» Quezon 

The violent deafth of Mrs. Aurora Quezon bring. 

leave it. on the minds of her 

now and in the years to come was her singular in- 
capacity to be corrupted even by fame. • 
P "/one deserved that fame more than she*d 
for her life was an immolation to an ideal o | 
But always, it was a Ufa pushed selflessly » the back 
ground of that brilliant career which was her bus- 

ba " d U i. ironic that she should have died in the hand, 
of people for whom she felt a deep-seated affec- 
tion Ft Is an irony that cannot be explained save 
on the ground that she lived in an age where men 
have lost faith in peace and must needs worship the 

CUH her* death would be in vain if it did not make 
us realize the urgency of putting into effect the ideal 
of social justice for which her husband lived and to 
which she devoted the remaining years o* her »«te. 

In a way, she died for her countrymen, just as 
her husband had died for them. 

For being herself, for the things she stood for 
and for the things she had done, we shall alway. 
remember her.

A HIGH CRIME 
THIS is no time for recri- 
mination. 

Someone has failed some- 
where but recrimination can- 
not give full redress to the 
wrong. . 

This is no time for indigna- 
tion. 

There has been enough or 
it in recent months. 

Twenty-four hours have 
passed since the beloved 
widow of a beloved leader, 
with 11 others were massac- 
red. The nation has suffer- 
ed an irreparable loss in the 
death of Mrs. Quezon, emblem 
of the greatness of our De- 
parted Leader and Father of 
Our Country, President Ma- 
nuel L. Quezon. A sober nation 
may now take stock of itself 
and of the ignonunous failings 
of its present leaders. 

Graft and corruption, con- 
stitutional violations, trafflc- 
kir.o m public funds, traffic- 
king in public office, heed- 
less wastage of the people's 
monev even these are nothing 
in comparison with the hign 
crime of plain inability to ot- 
ter the citizen common pro- 
tection. That inability has 
been made patent by sejg* 
ambuscades in Mieva fcc»J a 
alone during the mwth. 

There has been a hoi my- 
in* omission somewhere 
vhich borders npon wanton 
disregard for the publ.c safe-

THE NATION 
IN GRIEF 



Today the Filipino people aye 
' lU grief over the sadden death 
of Mrs. Aurora Aragon de Que- 
zon her son-in-law Philip Buen- 
camino III, her daughter Baby 
Quezon, and nine of their com- 
banians when their party was 
ambushed by lawless elements 
on the road to Baler, birthplace 
of Manuel L. Quezon, the great- 
est Filipino of the twentieth 

century. 7 7 

The tragedy is so overwhelm- 
ing it shocked the whole nation 
yesterday. For sometime the Fi- 
lipino people will feel the pain 
and sorrow of this national 
tragedy. 

Known far and wide as a per- 
son whose heart, like that of her 
distinguished husband, ivelled up 
w ith compassion for our bewil- 
dered masses, her sudden death 
at the hands of lawless elements 
brings into bold relief the un- 
satisfactory condition of peace 
and order in that part of the 
couniry, brining official claims 
to the contrary less than two 
weeks ago. 

In mourning their death, and 
condemning those who perpe- 
trated the dastardly attack, let 
vs, from this day, wake a firm 
resolve that the heart of our na- 
tional policy shall be to remove 
the conditions that lead men to 
extremes such as we have just 
witnessed, and Utt the lawful 
arm of the government go af- 
ter the attackers, whoever then 
may be, and bring th-em to his-

ATROCITY COMPOUNDED 
Tin- nation is in mourning today 
at the death of a great lady. 
It is more than shocked at the 
nature of her death, and that of 
close members of her family and 
others in till ambuscade that 
ended the life of Aurora Aragon 
Quezon. 

There is a revulsion of the na- 
tional spirit at the perpetrators' 
of the crime. There can be no 
doubt that they were Hukbata- 1 
haps. The general knowledge of 
the advent of Mrs. Quezon and 
her party to Baler makes it seem 
unlikely that the ambush was less 
than intentional and planned. The 
news had been broadcast and an- 
nounced in the press and the wel- 
come signs were up. 

The people of the country hard- 
I ly knew how much they revered 
and respected the widow of the 
late President Quezon. Her quiet 
influence for good, her conscien- 
tious and effective work on behalf 
of the Red Cross, her concern for 
( the people and the beautiful grape 
with which advancing years rested 
upon her had made her more of a 
national symbol than perhaps she 
herself realized. 

It took sudden death to bring 
; about a realization of her position 
in the land. In reality it was that 
of First Lady, both yesterday and 
today. And it seemed to require 
an atrocity of the magnitude of 
yesterday's to bring the people to 
full realization of the desperate 
wickedness ami senseless brava do 
of those who call themselves 
Huks, they and their misguided 
followers. 

There seems no alternative now 
to a determined pursuit and liqui- 
dation of the dissidents of central 
Luzon. They have finally com- 
mitted the unpardonable sin. 
There may have been a residual 
sympathy for the Huks because 
of their economic dnderprivilege, 
but when they seek to call na- 
tional attention to their plight by 
deliberately destroying a national- 
ly-loved symbol of decency, of 
good deeds, of long-loved tradi- 
tion and of the highest feminine 
virtue, then the law-abiding peo- 
ple of the land have no choice but 
to turn against them, for they 
have abandoned all claim to con- 
sideration. 

The greatest tragedy of all is 
the plight of those thousands of 
people caught in the middle, too 
frightened to defy the Huks, too 
bewildered to trust their govern- 
ment, too Involved In the misdeeds 
of the Huk leaders to escape 
suspicion and punishment at the 
hands of government forces who 
'"o\v have no choice but to try 
their best to de-droy the roots 
a great evil in the land.

STOP THOSE AMBUSCADES 

THE record shows that there have been 
■ seven ambuscades during the month in 
Mieva Lcija alone. That's too many acts of 
lawlessness within such a short span of time. 
Ihe last of these occurred only nine hours 
after the tragic killing of Mrs. Aurora A 
Quezon and eleven others while on their way 
to Baler, Quezon. 

Two ambuscades a week should provide 
sufficient warning to those in authority to 
take greater security measures in order to 
protect innocent lives. Too many have al- 
ready been lost. It should be apparent from 
these frequent depredations that there is 
no sense in allowing ourselves to be lulled 
into a false sense of security. 

There must be constant vigilance on the 
part of those in whose hands depends pub- 
lic security. Nothing should be taken for 
panted. We cannot regard the frequent, 
though scattered, attacks as mere svmptoms 
The more realistic attitude would be to con- 
sider them part of a pattern, an organized 
whole, which constitutes a grave menace to 
the law-abiding. The ambush which took 
place in Nueva Ecija several hours after the 
dastardly attack that cost the life of Mrs. 
Quezon could easily be a diversionary tac- 
tic to draw away law' enforcement agents 
from the scene of the murder of the Que- 
zons. 

Until such time as the country is rid of 
its Jawless elements, security measures 
should be taken to give the public max- 
imum assurance of safety in their peaceful 
endeavors to help make a go of this repub- 
lic. 

It should help a great deal to prevent am- 
buscades and highway robberies and kill- 
ings if mobile patrols are put to work in 
known dangerous sections of highways. 
During dangerous hours, busses and other 
vehicles could be stopped at checkpoints and 
convoyed by well-armed patrols. This should 
assure a reasonable amount of safety and 
should help facilitate the task of bringing 
to justice those responsible for an attack 
when and if it is perpetrated.

ducida por la tragedia natiwial del asesinato a sangre fria 
de Aurora Aragon de Quezon, ha tenido un eco vibrante y 
consoladm por el duelo general entre los que, en el extran- 
jero, conocieron y apreciaron U magnanimidad y realeza de 
aqueUa eximia personalidad. 

Con el florilegio de pdlabras, pensamientos y emeciones 
de cuantos liablaron de Dona Aurora, se lia tejido la mas 
pretiada guimalda de siemprevivas de sus contemporaneos. 

Etta, virtuosa y espiritualmente grande, se abrio con el 
altruismo para con sus semejaiites y su patriotismo para 
con su pueblo, un sitio de honor en la galeria de grandezas 
yatrias, y esa corona tejida por sus obras y por el amor con 
que las realizo, es la que indudablemente esta recibiendo 
ahora todo el perfume celeste para lucirla con el beso di- 
vino en la inmortalidad. 

Como cuando en dias de esclavitud pegabamos nuestros 
oidos at aparato de radio con sordina, acongojcukis nuestras 
almas oyendo claramente el planidero acento de cometas y 
apagado redobktr de tambores que acompanaban la marcha 
de Manuel L. Quezon a mi tumba provisional de Arlington; 
como con sinceridad ttor amos entonces la tnste separacion 
del padre de su pueblo;\ n alwra, el duelo nacional dice que 
Uoramos la tragica part xxdela que, por su esposo augusto, 
y por propia ejecut\)ria y su propio derroclw de amor, 
fue madre de su pueblo tambien. 

Decliado de mansedumbre y virtud, fue victima de la 
crueldad y del crimen. Cuantas veces, en su frecuente co- 
munion eucaristica, repetia eUa la formula de aceptacion de 
la muerte como a Dios plugiera darsela, tantas veces hacia 
la ofrenda dp su vida como la de sus saaificios, para bien 
de los sityos. Y suyos nosotros, expuestos a una situacion 
elastica de intranquilidad, la liemos visto ahora, aceptada 
su oblacion a Dios, caer tragicamente, para despertar de 
su letargo a nuestros gentes y hacemos resolver de una 
vez para siempre el tfoblema de la paz y or den, con el 
exterminio de la sedic n. 

Fueron cayendo \y}ldados de la patria, pacificos ciuda- 
danos de nuestra comunidad, y ni el grito de la sangre ni 
el instinto de conservacion, conmovieron suficientemente a 
nuestros gobernantes, a nuestros politicos, ni al potentado 
ni al proletario, para terminar con tan enojosa situacion. 
Hubo necesidad del horrible sacrificio de Aurora Aragon 
de Quezon, y de sus hijos y de sus adictos, con la inmolacion 
de oscuros soldados de su comitiva, para que viniera la re- 
action instantanea en pro de una guerra total y pronta al 
desorden y a la sublevacion. 

Ojala que ese holocausto no sea profanado por el logre- 
ro politico con sus argucias, ni por el demagogo con sus tor- 
pezas. El pueblo- tiene derecho a recoger el frito de la 
tragedia sin esa profanation. Para que sea mas pura nues- 
tra gratitud a quienes como Aurora Aragoifi de Quezon han 
dado sus vidas para que pudieramos vivir mejor. 

Hagamos bendita la memoria de los que por nosotros

Dejad Al Gobierno 

En la histeria national, causada por la fatal embosca- 
da contra nuestra Uorada Dona Aurora de Quezon y su co~ 
mitiva, los primwos en apresurarse a "pescar" han sido los 
que mas parte tuvieron por common o por omiskm en la 
txreacion del estado de cosas que produjo la tragedia; y los 
primeros en exigir responsabilidades, son los que, si no con- 
tribuyeron directamente a crear la situamon desesperada, 
fueron coresponsables del incremento, que ha tenido el 
deterioro, de la paz y el orden en Filipinas. 

Fatalmente, tristemente se ha cumplido lo que desde 
hace tres anos "Voz de Manila" ha venido pronosticando, 
jen el sentido de que "habria necesidad de que la sangre su- 
biera a la cumbre, al ojimpo/' para que politicos, asotiaciones 
dvicas, periodicos e instituciones se dieran cuenta del dolor 
que tantos huerfanos de honrados soldados, abnegados vo- 
luntaries, victimas propiciatorias entre hacendados y pro- 
letaries, venian sufriendo por la sedition, por la tolerancia 
"democratica" de elementos sociales perdidos en divagacio- 
nes ideologicas, de acrobatas de la demagogia promotora de 
la lucha de closes, de politicos interventores en toda action 
policiaca no solo para parar el golpe de la justicia, sino para 
quitar de sus puestos a oficiales celosos de su deber, que 
propugnaban la prevalencia del respeto a la ley, de gober- 
nantes acomodaticios a todos los vaivenes produtidos por el 
Vbertinaje de la prensa en manos de nobles corazones im- 
pulsivos, pero de bisona experiencia de la vida que viven de 
cara a los atrevidos progresos en renovar ideas y procedi- 
mientos, pero de espaldas a las irrefutdbles, inescapables 
Zecciones de la historia de veinte siglos desde que Ciisto 
vibrio los brazos en la cruz pidiendo "amaros los unos a los 
olros", y mas miles de anos desde la tragedia de Cain y 
Abel. 

La primera etapa del cumplimiento de nuestro pronos- 
tico fue cuando la tragedia del Juez Bautista, que provoco 
la primera proscription de los seditiosos; ya no se trataba 
simplemente de soldados de la nation, con ser los soldados 
lo mas heroico y abnegado que tiene el pueblo, sino que la 
ola criminal habia subido al estrado judicial. El gobierno, 
seeundado por el publico poseido de las primeras emociones 
histericas ante una realidad que aierraba ya, comenzo su 
labor de represion sistematica. 

La politicd, la comodidad acabo por abdndonar el em- 
p&no policiaco, y como no caian mas que soldados, gentes 
sencUlas, unos cuantos representantes menores de la auto- 
ridad; por eso no se volvieron a tener en cuenta la esencia 
del crimen de sedition y la pr esencia de la perversidad. 

Vino la action sincronizada de los representantes de la 
sedition en los periodicos, en los circulos politicos, en el go- 
bierno mismo, y a pesar del charco de sangre que separaba 
del resto de la sotiedad a los seditiosos, se penso en dar 
rntevas oportunidades a los enemigos publicos, se dio por 
consejo y consentimiento de todos la amnistia. . . 

Hubo ridiculo para el gobierno, burla sangrante contra 
las honrados intentiones presidentiales, procaz contumacia 
de la sedition, y volvimos a oir del sacrificio de los soldados, 
voluntarios, pobfes masas campesinas entregadas a una vida 
nomada... mientras los grandes pensadores empotrados 
en la prensa, en los selectos grupos tivicos* en los escanos 



legislatives, seguian intercediendo directa e indirectamente 
por la sedition, con un pretexto u otro, con una razon u 
otra. 

Pero la ola criminal de la sedition sintio en el oceano 
inmenso del comunismo international un empuje amolladoi\ 
y la ola, dejando en la resaca las piltrafas de soldados, vo- 
luntaries, victimas y verdugos de menor categoria, se agito 
mas soberbia, subio al mismo santuario national de los afec- 
tos popidares, arrastro tambien a la madre de su pueblo y 
a distinguidos seres de nuestra comunidad. 

Y alii hemos llegado, segun el pronostico que jamas hu- 
biera querido "Voz de Manila" hacer en tres anos de constan- 
te Uamada de atencion al gobierno y al pueblo, para que se 
tomara en honrada seriedad el avance del mal. 

Ahora que se ha llegado a parte de lo pretendido por 
el mal imperante, (parte porque no dismulan torvamente su 
sed de mas sangre "escogida"), ahora resurge la propaganda 
de concejales, legisladores, periodrstas, caudiUos sociales en 
favor de la sedition con EL PRETEXTO DE ATACAR EL 
MAL EN SU ORIGEN, en la necesidad de reforma social, 
empujando al pueblo a olvidar el pisoteo a la ley, a olvidar 
el crimen contra todo derecho natural, para recordar la re- 
forma social, para detir que no es solamente con tiros, sino 
con buena voluntad, con ilustration, con medidas sabias de 
gobierno como se puede terminar cbn la aisis. 

INSENSATOS. No les importa el hecho de que esta- 
mos en plena guerra, declarada, proclamada, jurada de la 
sedition contra el gobierno, contra el Estado. Es que es?ie- 
ran esos €( angelitos modernos del pensamiento y de la action 
democratica," que los criminales lleguen al terror general 
en todas las poblationes donde van penetrando, y como en 
los tiempos de la barbarie vayan las gentes abriendo su 
corazon y sus entranas al reformador triunfante a sangre 
y fuego? Es que tanta gente honrada e inofensiva quiere 
que, si por acaso muera .tambien en el reinado del terror, 
haya quien anuncie en los periodicos que a era contribuyente 
a la causa de los huks", como oh BLASFEMIA, se difo de la 
santa Dona Aurora en el sentido de que era de las que mas 
sostenian el movimiento. . . y eso lo publicaron los que die- 
ron a la estampa la ultima carta de Taruc? 

Que el recuerdo de Boabdil, al Uorar sobre Granada per- 
dida, no se repita en nuestro gobierno y en nuestros tiuda- 
danos de alguna influencia social y oficial, pues si no vence- 
mos como hombres el empuje de la sedition, muy pronto 
tendremos que Uorar su triunfo, con lagrimas de mujer. 

Por eso insistimos: estamos en plena guerra, y en la 
guerra no se permiten titubeos de hermafroditas, caricias al 
enemigo ni estorbo al militar. Dejad a la Cruz Roja que 
vaya con ternuras, a los capellanes con la conmiseracion, a 
los ninos con el panico del temor. Al Gobierno y al brazo 
armado de la nation dejad que limpien el campo, y una vez 
limpio este levanten sus tiendas de campana de altruismo los 
reformadores civicos, los honrados videntes de la justicia 
social. Entonces, no antes, no vaya un tiro a secar la mano 
del que da pan, no vaya una ametraUadora a perforar el co- 
razon que da amor, no vaya la granada de mano a levantar 
la tapa de los sesos a la cabeza, que busca para los des- 
graciados seditiosos la realization de un ideal. Entonces y 
no antes. Y ahora dejad tranquilo al gobierno en action, 
ahora mientras todavia hay tiempo, no despues cuando ven- i 
ga la desesperacion total. j

DONA AURORA 

Unanime es la indignacion como profundo y ge- 
neral el dcloi? que ha producido el asesinato de la que 
por muchos titulos era el simbolo reoonocido de la rnujer 
filipina de nuestros tiempos que, a las virtudes carac- 
teristicas de Maria Clara, supb jmitar las cualidades 
civicas y el progreso intel.ectual de hogano. 

No hay vccablos basta'ntes para expresar cumpli- 
damente esos sentimientos de pena y condenacion que 
embargan el corazon de la nation filipina, y el de cuan- 
tos aman el bien y admiran la'virtud. Dona Aurora era 
amada y respetada quiza no tanto por la altisima posi- 
cion social que digmsimamente ocupo, cuanto por la 
caridad que constantemente ardia en su corazon y que 
sabia manifestarse de mil diyersos modos. Su excelsa 
personalidad era una alborada continua de buenas 
obras, de virtudes crlstianas y civicas cuyos rayos 
iluminaban todos los confines sociales, lo mismo las 
suntuosas moradas de los ilustrados y pudientes que 
los humildes hogares de los desheredados de la fortuna* 
y el saber. Por esto, con su muerte han caido las som- 
bras del dolor sobre millares de almas. 

Mientras expresamos nuestra condolencia a siis 
amados huerfanos— multiplemente heridos— , y roga- 
mos por su alma y las de quienes la acompanaron en 
la muerte, sumamos nuestra mas dura condenacion u 
Ja indignacion general que pide justicia inexorable cen- 
tra los infames autores de la tragedia asesina.

SLAYING OF MRS. QUEZON AND DAUGHTER 
SHOCKS NATION 



FOTO REPORTS.. 




MRS. AURORA A. OL'I.ZOX 



|/b A few days after President Elpidio 
Quirino had rounded out his one year 
of administration which he commemo- 
rated with a rousing fire-side chat enu- 
merating his accomplishments including 
the establishment of peace and order, 
afternoon newspaper readers and radio 
listeners were stunned with a special 
news flash:. Philippine National Red 
Cross Chairman Aurora Aragon Quezon, 
Baby Quezon and members of their 
party were slain or seriously wounded 
by armed attackers in Nucva Ecija. 
In a matter of hours the whole country 
learned the shocking details of the story. 
Besides Mrs. Quezon, Baby and Mayor 
Pcnciano Bernardo of Quezon City, 
nine others had died on the spot or soon 
after the ambush. 

According to integrated reports the 
Quezon motorcade travelling in eleven 
cars, station wagons and jeeps with a 
light Constabulary escort was just en- 
tering Quezon province on its way to 
Baler to unveil the historical maker 
on Manuel Quezon's birthplace when 
it was suddenly fired upon by a strong 
force of bandits and/or Hukbalahaps- 
Ex-Chief (0 f Staff of the Philippine 
Army Major General Jalandoni who 
was with Mrs. Quezon in a leading 
car was the only person to crawl out 
alive after a concentrated madiinegun 
fire from the outlaws. Displaying an 
amazing complacency reflecting the op- 
timism of the administration the escort 
failed to put up any defense, much less 
provide the military intelligence work 
that could have averted the ambush. On 
this point many observers unanimously 
agreed. There was complete agreement 
too in the people's opinions regarding 
the national loss: the Philippines' great- 
est humanitarian and first lady and her 
daughter Baby, a young socialite social 
worker — both of whom did much to 
keep the people from forgetting the 
Quezonian service-to-country tradition.

HARDLY two weeks after President Quirino an- 
nounced that peace and order had been restor- 
ed—an "achievement" of his administration, Mrs. 
Aurora Aragon de Quezon, her daughter, her son-in- 
law and nine others were massacred in the most 
shocking tragedy the Philippines has experienced. 
The ambuscade, all the more barbarous because of 
the dignity and innocence of its victims, was never- 
theless only one of a series of recent daring, succes- 
sive and similar raid by Huk bands on civilian trave- 
lers. It is only too evident, and increasingly so, that 
there is no peace and certainly no order. 

Editorial writers, national leaders, government of- 
ficials and even the little man on the street have laid 
the blame squarely at the door of the administration. 
And in the very last analysis one can reach under the 
circumstances, after all the emoting, the reproaches 
and regrets, the if-only's and the what-might-have- 
been's— after all that, it remains that the govern- 
ment has failed, and with what revolting consequen- 



. i 

ces, in giving the Filipino citizens what their con- 
stitution guarantees: protection to life and property. 

It took the death of the Quezons and their com- 
panions in death to jolt the government, and the na- 
tion with it, out of its egotistic politicking, out of 
its smug and blind complacency, out of its hay-mak- 
ing escapism, out of its cowardly refusal to recognize , 
that the Huks are still here, stronger if anything. In 
spite of amnesty, all-out campaign, firm assurance 
from general and department secretary and pres- 
ident, it has become painfully apparent everything is 
not all right, that the demon of Huklandia will not 
be exorcised by the incantation that "all is quiet," 
nor appeased by ineffectual government crop loans, 
seedlings and irrigation systems nor annihilated bv 
PC and AFP bombardments. 

Neither is it enough for the administration to 
claim now shamefacedly, in the face of such terrible 
proof of failure, that it has done its best. But has it? 
Or if it has, isn't it undeniable that its best is far 
from being good enough? *

WHY? 

Even now the question is still being asked: Why was Mrs. 
Quezon killed? Nothing the Huks had done aroused so much anger 
all over the Philippines as the murder of Mrs. Quezon, her daughter 
and son-in-law, and nine others. The attack was sudden and trea- 
cherous. Deliberation was evident in the gun emplacements that 
had been prepared days in advance at the point of the ambuscade. 
Men were held captive, to make more deadly certain the success of 
the well-laid plan. For weeks in advance, it was generally known 
in the surrounding area that on that day Mrs. Quezon and party 
would pass along that road to Baler to honor the memory of her 
husband. The Huks boast of possessing a first-class intelligence ser- 
vice, better, it is even said, than the Constabulary's. The Huks knew 
that' Mrs. Quezon was in the party when they opened fire on it. 
One of the killers said as Mrs. Quezon's body lay dead, plundered 
of valuables by the forces, as the Communists like to term them, of 
national liberation: "Your Mrs. Quezon with the white hair is dead. 

But why was Mrs. Quezon killed? What possible benefit did 
the Huks expect from the murder? Taruc has come out with a state- 
ment deploring the death of Mrs. Quezon. In his own way, he tried 
to praise the dead by claiming that she had contributed money to 
the movement of which he is the head. He places blame on the 
government and the Americans, pointing to the arrival of former U.S. 
Ambassador Paul V. McNutt as an ominous sign, but surely even 
Taruc does not believe that the government and the Americans de- 
sired and plotted Mrs. Quezon's death. J S „ 
Taruc admits the possibility of a breach of the Iron Discipline 
of the Huks and, if there is such a breach, promises punishment "to 
the limits of severity" for the guilty. Is Taruc then, no longer in 
full control of his men? Has he sowed the wind and now reaps the 
whirlwind? That the Huks murdered Mrs. Quezon and her party 
is beyond doubt. If Taruc is in control of his men, if the Iron Disci- 
pline 4 he boasts of has not been breached, then one can only conclude 
that Luis Taruc coldly ordered the massacre, that the slaughter ot 
the innocents was his will. . r _ 

But why? Was it, perhaps, to discredit the governments there 
may lie the answer. President Quirino has said more than once 
with complacency, and military authorities have echoed him, that 
peace has been restored. The ambuscade - was it not Taruc s de- 
fiant answer to that claim?

g On The Tragic Death Of Mrs. Quezon 

^ woman dfed and a whole nation is in sorrow, 
S.This is an extremely rare event in the contemporary 
history of the world. Mrs. Aurora Aragon Quezon's 
>j sacrifice Is the most shocking tragedy of the postwar 
I World ; and she has received the greatest honor ever 
I accorded a woman by a nation. 

It is not only the people of her own country that ar~ 
I mourning in the deepest grief conceivable her irreparable 
I loss; the cosmopolitan community of the Philippines 
I and the leaders of the world shared the grief that her 
] own nation bore and continues to bear. 

As if to accentuate the greatness of her immor- 
! tality, she passed away on her way home to the town 
where she and her distinguished husband ware born just 
H before the turn of the last century. 

§j ^ During the lifetime of Manuel Luis Quezon, the 
I Great Builder of the Philippine Republic and one of the 
j truly great men of the 20th Century, she shared .the suf. 
I ferings and hard struggles and the innumerable setbacks 
oJ that Great Builder. She served, in a great measure, 
g as an inspiration for the success of that Great Builder. 
I She held aloft her loyalty to the allied cause for the sake 
I of justice, of liberty, of democracy in the second World 
; War. She bore courageously, in the life in exile together 
• with that Great Builder, the ideals of her people. 

i . Even ( after the death of the late President: Quezon* 
I ; she returned sadly but solemnly to her dear homeland; 
upholding the Quezon dignity. She became the N shining 
; light of the nation as she devoted most enthusiastically 
I her time and energies to her religious and charity works, 
and to helping the nation to. bring about social, justice 
to the people she loved. 

She loved her nation and her people. She had 

every goodwill toward mankind. They loved her wil» 

always love her. The cosmopolitan community adored 
her — will always adore and venerate her. 

The Fookien Times remembers and holds most 
• dearly a letter from her in which she said: "I have al- 
; ways shared with my late husband's feeling that the 
good of mankind should be the ultimate aim of all and 
every nation. It is that ideology that has prompted me 
to give my efforts to the Red Cross movement, to unite 
: men and" women from all over the World in the common 
. pursuit of a single idea — understanding and goodwill/ 
She is now absent from among us, but her valuable 
words live forever an the minds and hearts of men. 

How could anybody kill her? 
Why should her life in this World end thus? Should 
I w>c repeat the remarks Bernard Shaw in' commenting on 
the death of the great Gandhi at the hands of his own 
' people when he said : "It is dangerous to be a good man 
in this world/' 

Her memory is still very fresh in the minds of the! 
people of this nation. Just a few days before the tra- 
gedy, Mrs. Quezon condemned the holding of the Car- 
1 nival in Baguio during the Holy week, particularly m the! 
agonizing days of the Man of Sorrow who carried His 
Cross to Calvary. She met her most cruel and unjust 
death as her Savior did. 

For her, death is not {he end. Her life in this world 
J is finished. She had completed her task, to remain tor-i 
ever an inspiration to her nation and to give th*t beautiful 
thought of the noble idea of understanding and goodwill 
toward mankind, to the receptive minds and hearts ofj 
men who knew and remembered her, who will chggj|| 
fnr all time.

MRS. AURORA QUEZON, DAUGHTER, SON-IN-LAW 
LAID TO REST AS FILIPINO NATION MOURNS 

Sudden death came last week to Mrs Aurora One™ 
daughter « B ab y » he r son-in-law Philip Buencamnio ^11 Mayor 

rerJ^fl^ ManHa neSrby Pr ° vinces were locked. by the 

New % I™?™ ° f D ° fia AUVOra and memb6, - s of her fLly! 

lievp iHfl ^ SP1 ' ead " ke Wildfh ' e - Tt Was hard to be- 

I.eve it at first, but passion and sorrow ran hi ff h when the city 
newsnapers and radio stations confirmed the story 

The fnllownie day the news of the undeserved killing of the 
beloved widow of the "emblem of the greatness" of our departed 

S£/£twT 1 our Country - President Q — »• ™ M *' 

corners of the Islands. 

The scene of the murder was in Barrio Salubusob on a bend of 
; the Villa Aurora-Ziezae Boneahon. It was near the approaches 
to Baler and withm Nueva Ecijff. 

The Quezon party was a motorcade of several cars including 
two loons b°arinjr constabulary men who served as escort 

The group was bound for Baler to attend ceremonies for the 
unveiling of a marker of the birthplace of the Me President Que- 
zon. ^ 

Included amonsr the known killed were: 'Col. Primitive San 
Asast-n and Lt. Col. Antonio San Agustin; two lieutenants, and 
Tour other persons. 

Wound-d were Maj. Gen. Rafael Jalandoni, ex-Chief of Staff 
I of thft p h ll7 ^Pine Army, Cant. O. Manalang a«nd a corporal. 

After the massacre, the killers robbed their victims of their cash 
and other valuables. 

The mortal remains of the Quezon family were brought to the 
UST chapel where milling crowds of admirers and sympathizers 
from the humblest to the hie-hest, eacrerly sought enhance. 

The deceased were survived by Nini and Non-mg Quezon, who 
were heard to have collapsed when told of what had happened. 
Nim is the wife of Philin. by whom they have a child. 

The following day, the nation mourned as the remains of the 
Quezons were laid to rest at the, Cementerio del Norte,, beside the 
tomb of the "grand old man." , ' 

The funeral was attended by a crowd estimated from 200,000 
upwards, which lined the streets from the UST chapel to the' ce- 
metery. 

Everyone was bowed in grief. In the same breath, each felt 
unbounded anger at the heartless, savage murderers. 

To avenge the death of the nation's beloved family, a joint 
army-PC force of 2,000 armed men at once went on a punitive drive 
against Huks and bandits around the area where Mrs. Quezan and 
party were ambushed.

Editorial Digest 



In unison, the Manila papers cry out for swift 
justice against the perpetrators of "the murder of 
Mrs. Aurora Aragon Quezon and 11 members of 
her party. It's the last straw, they all say in effect, 
in words as follows; 

»<r 

The Manila Times: "A people cowers in sor- 
row today. The most revered 'woman in the land, 
her daughter, ten others were massacred, while 
traveling on a public road... this fact cannot be 
explained, cannot be excused, cannot be rational- 
ized. . . Doha Aurora, the widow of Manuel L. Que- 
zon, the quiet shining lamp that held before the 
people the memory of that flaming light of free- 
dom that was Quezon, was murdered. And the 
people cowers in sorrow — and waits — for more 
murders ?" 

»« 

The Manila Chronicle: 4 'The question is WHY. 
Why a movement whose leaders claim to be ins- 
pired by a passion to improve life must needs des- 
troy innocent life to attain its ends. Why the tra- 
gic hand of chance must fall on a woman, beloved 
of her people; on a woman whose heart went even 
for those who snuffed out her life. No crime could 
be more heinous. The circumstances which 
brought to fruition the tragedy of yesterday must 
be rooted out once and for all or Mrs. Quezon shall 
have died in vain." - 

>« »« 

The Manila Daily Bulletin- "There seems no al- 
ternative now to a determined pursuit and liquida- 
tion of the dissidents of Central Luzon. They have 
finally committed the unpardonable sin. There 
may have been a residual sympathy for the Huks 
because of their economic undei privilege, but when 
they seek to call national attention to their plight 
by deliberately destroying a nationally-loved sym- 
bol of decency, of good deeds, of long-loved tradi- 
tion and of the highest feminine virtue, then the 
law-abiding people of the land have no choice but 
to turn* against them." 



A People In Sorrow 



A people cowers in sorrow today. 

Never before In remembered history has this people suf- 
fered such a blow. 

The most revered woman in the land, her daughter, ten 
others, were massacred, while traveling on a public road. 

These are the facts. 

They cannot be explained, they cannot be excused, they 
cannot be rationalized. 

The killers knew whom they were killing. All the evi- 
dence points that way. They were told. Yet they killed. 

It Is fatuous to make distinctions. It is fatuous to say 
that the killers were this and that, and not that and this. 

The simple fact stares out, that this was premeditated 
attack, carefully arranged t6 bring the maximum of attacking 
force on the prey which the attackers knew was going to be 
at a certain place at a certain time. 

Dna. Aurora Aragon de Quezon, the widow of Manuel 
L Quezon, was murdered. The quiet, shining lamp that held 
before the people the memory of that flaming light of free- 
desk that was Quezon, was murdered. 

Aurora Quezon, that bright, sparkling flash that was 
such a vivid reflection of a world-great father, was murdered. 

Ten other innocent people were murdered. 

And a people cowers in sorrow — and waits — for 
triers murders? 




No Greater Crime 



The question is WHY. 

Why a movement whose leaders claim to he ins- 
pired by a passion to improve life must needs de- 
stroy innocent life to attain its ends. Why the tra- 
gic hand of chance must fall on a woman, beloved of 
her people; on a woman whose heart went even for 
those who snuffed out her life. No crime could be 
more heinous. 

Let us remember. 

Mrs. Aurora Quezon was on her way to honor 
the memory of her husband, a man whose career 
was founded on an abiding love for the common 
man. She had made that love the mainspring of 
her life. And so the ironic overtones of her death 
cannot be lost even to those who killed her. 

And Mrs. Quezon was not alone. There were 
others with her in her fataE trip and aSil of them 
must now be cEiatked up as victims of the relentless 
pursuit of eads through violent means. 

But there is ao time for recrimination, only for 
justice. 

The crime speaks out loudly and eloquently for 
the government to act swiftly — and wisely, to 
bring its implacable force on the authors of the deed. 
No compromise is jpossible any longer. 

Those in authority cannot hide the situation from 
the rest of the people any more. The truth must 
be out — the sad, bitter truth that the Huks are still 
a problem, shocking us by the impact of their excess* 
es. Gratuitous statements from government officials 
drifting the rfeed of Mrs. Q uezon i death to other 
than the most possible perpetrators thereof must be 
dismissed as an attempt to hide a terrible failure. 

The murder of Mrs. Quezon and her daughter 
^ end her friends is not an isolated case in the violent 
career of the Huks. The question is why they must 
resort to naked lawlessness, why they must use ter- 
ror to remold the world nearer to their hearts' de- 
sire. 

But there must be no more violence, no more - 
killings. The Huks have committed no greater out- 
rage. The problem they pose must be solved.. This 
fhould be our goal and the circumstances which 
brought to fruition the tragedy of yesterday must 
be rooted out once and for all or Mrs. Aurora Que- 
zon, a woman bel oved of all, shall have died in vain.

La Tragedia Escribe Y Manda 

La sedition lia vuelto a escribir "una pdgina luctuosa 
en nuestra historia. El gobierno, la prensa, los elementos 
civicos, los militares, el pueblo todo, deben hacer que esta 
tragedia por la sedition sea la ultima que se escriba, y que 
sea la suprema que mande: exterminio del movimiento huk, 
pero exterminio total hasta en las idtimas madrigueras y 
en los mas reconditos reductos. Guerra sin cuartel, sin con- 
templaciones a la ayuda moral que hasta los periodicos dan 
cuando publican palabras de Taruc; sin contemplaciones a 
las predicationes ideologicas de "intelectuales," que no dis- 
tinguen la ideologia hablada de la que va armada de todos 
los instruments de destruction; sin contemplaciones a los 
gastos que represente la empresa de asegurar la paz y el 
orden, no soiamente en las ciudades y pueblos sino en el 
despoblado, en la espesura del bosque, en la red de los ca- 
minos; sin miramientos a las "patificas apariencias" de 
los complices del crimen con su obra quintocolumnista, su 
obra de espionaje y de ayuda econ&mica y tdctica a los se- 
ditiosos. Guerra ^sin cuartel, pero guerra de verdad, con to- 
dos los recursos de nuestras organizations armadas, pues 
si eso no se hace, esta RepPblica se vera envuelta en tiempo 
prdximo en la mas horrenda guerra civil. El gobernante 
que no ordene esto, el ciudadano que no accpte estOj el ser- 
vidor publico refractario o negligente sobre esto, recibirdn 
la maldicion de la historia. 

Adoptemos esta resolution, recordando cd Presidente 
Quezon, padre de nuestro pueblo, cuyos pedazos del alma lo 
sedition asesina ha descuartizado con horrendo crimen, ha- 
ciendo de su santa esposa y de sus hips yuntamente con un 
grupo de amigos y leales, las victimas propiciatorias para 
el restabletimiento total, literal, sin dibujos retdricos, de Ic 
paz y el orden en Filipinos, que por reinar aparentemente en 
ciudades y pueblos fueron proclamados existentes, mientras 
la tecnica represiva se contento con ahuyentar y airincoyiar 
a la fiera, sin poner fin a ella. Adoptemos esta resolution con 
toda la honradez ciudadana, olviddndose el legislador de los 
cortes de presupuesto para la defensa armada de nuestra 
tranquilidad social. 

La tragedia que ahora nos tiene en duelo national, es 
cribe ominosa la condenacion de los que de un modo u otrc 
han hecho relajarse la discipline social, el respeto a la ley ? 
a la autoridad, de los que con teorias novedosas sobre avancc 
democrdtico han olvidado la prdctica antigua de la perver- 
sidad criminal del libertinaje en la democracia. Y esta tra- 
gedia, esta catdstrofe que siembra dolor y tristeza en Za< c 
conciencias honradas, manda que mayoria y minoria, go* 
bernantes y opositionistas, se unan para el exterminio de lc 
sedicidn. 

Por los manes de la patria, por los caudillos que en vid( 
velaron por la felitidad de la nation, no olvidemos LA TRA- 
GEDIA QUE ESCRIBE Y MANDA.

fered such a blow. 

_ The most revered woman in the land, her daughter, ten 
wiers, were massacred, while traveling on a public road. 
These are the facts. 

They cannot be explained, they cannot be excused, they 
cannot be rationalized. 

The killers knew whom they were killing. All the evi- 
dence points that way. They were told. Yet they killed. 
, " * $ fatuous to make distinctions. It is fatuous to say 
mot the killers were this and that, and not that and this. 

The simple fact stares out, that this was premeditated 
attack, carefully arranged to bring the maximum of attacking 
force on the prey whith the attackers knew was going to be 
at a certain place at a certain time. 

Dna * Aurora Aragon de Quezon, the widow of Manuel 
Quezon, was murdered. The quiet, shining lamp that held 
before the people the memory of that flaming light of free- 
dom that was Quezon, was murdered. 

Aurora Quezon, that bright, sparkling flash that was 
such a v5vid reflection of a world-great father, was murdered. 

Ten other innocent people were murdered. 

And a people cowers in sorrow — and waits — for 
more murders? 




No Greater Crime 



The question is WHY. 

Why a movement whose leaders claim to be ins- 
pired by a passion to improve life must needs de- 
stroy innocent life to attain its ends. Why the tra- 
gic hand of chance must fall on a woman, beloved of 
her people; on a woman whose heart went even for 
those who snuffed out her life. No crime could be 
more heinous. v 

Let us renlember. 

rs. Aurora Quezon was on her way to honor 
the memory of her husband, a man whose career 
was founded on an abiding love for the common 
man. She had made that love the mainspring of 
her Hfe. And so the ironic overtones of her death 
cannot be lost even to those who killed her. 

And Mrs. Quezon v/as not alone. There were 
others with her imher fatal trip and alii of them 
must now be chalked up as victims of the relentless 
pursuit of eads through violent means. 

But there is no time for recrimination, only for 
justice. 

The crime speaks out loudly and eloquently for 
the government to act swiftly — and wisely, to 
bring its implacable force on the authors of the deed. 
No compromise is possible any longer- 

Those in authority cannot hide the situation from 
the rest of the people any more. The truth must 
be out — the sad, bitter truth that the Huks are still 
a problem, shocking us by the impact of their excess- 
es. Gratuitous statements from government officials 
shifting the deed of Mrs. Quezon** death to other 
than the most possible perpetrators thereof must be 
dismissed as an attempt to hide a terrible failure. 

The murder of Mrs. Quezon and her daughter 
^ and her friends is not an isolated case in the violent 
career of the Huks. The question is why they must 
resort to naked lawlessness, why they must use ter- 
ror to remold the world nearer to their hearts' de- 
tire. 

But there must be no more violence, no more 
killings. The Huks have committed no greater out- 
rage. The problem they pose must be solved.. This 
should be our goal and the circumstances which 
brought to fruition the tragedy of yesterday must 
be rooted out once and for all or Mrs. Aurora Que- 
zon, a woman beloved of all, shall have died in vain.

Quirino Mourns 
At Quezon Bier 

President Rushes 
Down From Baguio 

Sadness was written, all* over 
President Quirino's face as "he, 
prayed for the Quezon family at 
the UST chapel this morning, 
i »« »<< 

The President, in a white linen 
suit, with a black tie and a black 
band around his left arm, entered 
the chapel about 9:26 a.m. to- 
day with his daughter Vicky. A 
hush fell on the chapel as he 
crtme escorted by aides. He had 
just arrived by plane from Ba- 
gnio a few minutes before. 

»« :»« 
The milling hundreds in the 
chapel willingly gave him room as 
he went directly near the altar 
at which the caskets lay. He 
moved as if to approacb Mrs. Que- 
zon's casket, but instead knelt 
down to pray. 

Almost at the same time, NinI 
and Nonong Quezon appeared at 
the altar, to which they had quiet- 
ly slipped by a backdoor. No- 
nong, his eyes red. immediately 
proceeded to pray. Nirri looked at 
the caskets for a while, then told 
a friend, "I want to know where 
they are," meaning she wished to 
find out which body was in what 
coffin. She refused to have the 
caskets opened. 

The caskets of Mrs. Quezon and 
Mayor Ponciano Bernardo were 
draped with Red Cross flags. 
Quezon City policemen stood vigil 
over Bernardo's casket, Red Cross 
personnel over Mrs. Quezon's, and 
Girl Scouts over Baby's and Philip 
Buencamino's. 

Gen. Rafael Jalandoni, former 
AFP chief of staff, was the cen- 
ter of attention at the UST cha- 
pel this morning. He had a sm»all 
scratch on his right cheek. 

An atmosphere of quiet trag- 
edy hang over the chapel as peo- 
ple came and went. 

Mrs. Bernardo and the mother 
of the late mayor declined to go 
near the altar and view the re- 
mains. On Mrs. Bernardo's face 
was a look of unbelief. 

High officialdom had been rub- 
bing elbows with common citizens 
at the chapel since early this 
morning. Among the first to pay 
their final respects were Senate 
President Mariano J. Cuenco. 
Speaker Eugenio Perez, Senate 
President Protempore Melecio Ar- 
ranz. Auditor General Manuel 
Agregado, Secretary Primitivo Lo- 
vina, Senators Carlos P. Garcia 
and Fernando Lopez, Manager 
Sergio Bayan, Undersecretary Re- 
gino Padua, Minister Thomas 
Locke tt, Generals Jonathan Ander- 
son, Calixto Duque and Alberto 
Ramos, RFC Governor Delfin 
Buencamino, Secretary Teodoro 
Evangelista, and Governor Grego- 
rio Santayana. Mesdames Trim— 
dad Roxas, Consuelo Salazar Pe- 
jrez and Col. Andres Soriano also 
I went to the chapel early. 

Many of those who went to the 
oh a pel were disappointed at not 
having been able to' "'have a last 
look at Mrs. Quezon. They said 
their had no opportunity to see 
the late President's widow in Per- 
son in her lifetime. 



tfaj. Gei. Rafael Jalandoni. 
Hio'was wttii the party of Mrs.] 
vue.-fon, escaped death by sheer 
Miracle-. The former AFP chief 
\f staff said he* was seated be- 
side Mrs. Quezm at the rear of 
^-e car while Mayor Ponciano 
Bernardo was at the other end 
•'hen the attack came so sud- 



Ujp to late last night, the 1st 
PC combat battalion under the 
personal command of Lt. Col. Xa- 
^poieon D. Valeriano and elements 
j of tite Xueva Ecfta PC continued 
combing the vicinity of the am- 
bush area with armored cars and 
on foot in search of the ambush- 
ers. Capt. Burgosino Fausto of 
the Xueva Eci.ia PC had come 
up£~ the ambush gang a few j 
minutes after the incident broke h 
; out. 

The place of the attacks, ac- 
cording to the general, was in 
Xueva Ecija a few miles from 
the Quezon boundary on the 
~of Bongabon. Col. Antonio San 
Agustin, sweepstakes official. ' 
v?as at the wheel. Bab}' Aurora | 
Quezon sat beside him, and Phil- 
ip Buencaniino III was at the j 
opposite end in the front seat.' 
The car was owned by Mayor; 
Bernardo. 

After the sudden barrage from 
outside, Tony San Agustin was; 
first hit and he slumped dead,; 
General Jalandoni narrated. Mrs., 
Quezon and Mayor Bernardo mor-j 
faliy wounded, " fell on Jalandoni;: 
who presently lost consciousness lj 
when • he was hit in the head by !' 
the butt . of a gun presumably I 
from one of the ambushers on 
the road. 

Gen. Jalandoni recalled be- 
cause of the abruptness of the 
attack, the soldiers inside three, 
escorts following the car in which! 
Mrs. Quezon 'rode, could not re- 1 
taliate. The soldiers were kill-! 
ed instantly as they sat inside 
Weir jeeps' 

General Jalandoni said Mayor! 
Bernardo told the attackers in 
Tagalog- Mrs. Quezon was » with 
the party. Notwithstanding the I 
admonition, the barrage contin- 
j ued. _ _ .-.I.- — d 

The general also disclosed that! 
;T.he bandits stripped Mrs. Que- 
. zon's body of the jewels she • 
[wore. The gang also 'robbed Ja- 
ilandoni of his signet ring while 
| he was unconscious. 

Jalandoni said he was inclined 
Xo believe the attackers were 
Huks from the systematic way 
^■the ambush Avas carried out. 
".There were apparently machine- 
gun emplacements and machine- 
;guns. Thompsons, Garands, and 
[carbines were used, he said. 

The car in which Mrs. Quezon 
[was' riding in was ahead of the 
convoy of jeeps because the Pres* 
: ident's widow preferred It that 
way so as not to catch the dust 
on * the country road, the general 
\ told - newsmen. 

At a meeting in the office of. 
Secretary Evangeiista last night. 
Secretary of Justice Sabino Pa- ! 
clilla .was reported to have made 
the suggestion clamping mar- 
ftial law in the area of the am- 
|bush but Brig. Gen. Alberto Ra- 
|mos, PC chief, observed the inci- 
dent was localized and that the 
.situation was well under control. 

General Ramos told the Times 
reinforced PC troops have been 
ordered to the area between 
Nueva Ecija and Quezon to cor- 
_don the bandits and account for 
the last outlaw who took part in 
..the ambush. 

Hilarion Silayan, • one of the 
members of the party, returned 
to Manila early last evening. As 
Silayan gathered from General Ja- 
landoni, the first car bearing Mrs. 
Quezon, Miss Aurora (Baby) Q U e-

those unhurt, immediately returned'

when hit with the butt of a gun ^ on " of ^ a« S

of staff of the Philippine Army | 
crashing to the ground. When he, 
came to, the general saw the dead j 
bodies of ^Irs. Quezon and Miss 
Quezon in the car and constabu- 
lary • soldiers around. 

The second vehicle in the mo- 
torcade according to Silayan, was 
a jeep occupied by the San Agus- 
tin brothers, who were both killed. 
Silayan did not know who occu- 
pied the third car. 

The fourth car, a station wagon 
driven by Dr. Luis Alandy, pri- 
vate physician of the Quezon fa 
mily, was deserted when the fir- 
ing occurred. Its occupants ran 
j to the other cars behind. Later, 
; constabulary soldiers carried the 
bodies of the dead and wounded 
from the first two cars and dis- 
tributed ' them to the other cars, 
Silayan said. 

Silayan's car was the seventh 
in the motorcade, and it was a- 
bout two kilometers behind when, 
the shooting took place. Silayan 
said he and his companion in the 
.car, Arturo Xitorreda, district en- 
gineer of Xueva Ecija, heard the 
rat-tat-tat of machine guns. 

A few minutes later they saw 
the cars in front of them return- 
ing and warning all the rest to 
turn back. 

The following were not wound- 
ed: Miss Amparo Aragon, sister of 
Mfrs Quezon, Mrs. Enriqueta Am- 
ador, former Governor and Mrs. 
Maximo Rodriguez. Mrs. Sixto de> 
Ja Costa. Dr. Luis Alandy, and Pe- 
dro Alcantara. 

Judge Sixto de la Costa, legal 
counsel of the Rehabilitaion Fin- 
ance Corporation, was not wijh 
s the party. Earlier reports stated 
that he was with the party and 
was killed. 

Silayan said that he was saved 
from certain death by two blow- 
outs on the way. He said his car 
was third from the Quezon car 
when he suffered his first' blowout 
and had to ehange a tire. This 
delayed him and put him back 
several cars behind. About a half 
hour later another blowout occurr- 
ed, and this second accident- re- 
legated him again farther down 
the line, placing him seventh in 
the line of cars. 

Dr. Eduardo Quisumbing, one 
of the survivors, narrated last 
night that he was first made 
aware of the ambush when he 
hear a faint shot fired in the air, 
which he said could have been a 
signal. It was instantly followed 
by a volley and answering shots 
from the PC escort.. 

Dr. Quisumbing said he was in 
a car about 15 yards behind Mrs. 
Quezon's car and that he did not 
see the attackers whom he said, 
"could have been Huks, but I'm 
not sure. Anyway, they were bad 
men." He was aware at the time, 
however, that the raid was con- 
ducted at close range and the 
brief battle was almost a hand to 
hand encounter. 

At the start of the trip, Mr. Qui- 
sumbing's car was second in the 
entourage, but was elbowed out 
later by two PC jeeps, in one of 
which was Primitivo San Agustin 
and his driver, both of whom 
u*re killed.

also taken.

mino III, Mayor Ponciano Bernardo of Quezon City, and eight others, 
has roused people in all sections of life in all parts of the country 
to demand for. a determined drive to root out lawlessness completely 
from the Republic. 

Messages poured in Malacanan and in newspaper offices, from 
all points of the compass this morning, mourning the death of the 
distinguished widow of the greatest Filipino of the 20th Century, and 
truly the most outstanding representative of Filipino motnerhood 

Surcharged with grief, these messages are one in demanding that 
President Quirino use the full might of the lawful arm of the gov- 
ern ment to go after the lawless elements and bring them to justice, 

'while at the same time demanding 
an all-out offensive to bring light 
and hope to our bewildered mas- 
ses. 

The tragedy was big news 
around the world. President Tru- 
man was shocked by the report. 
Wherever the report of the trage- 
dy was flashed, within and out- 
side the Philippines, the feeling 
was one of revulsion and grief. 

Last night, endless thousands 
struggled to see the bodies of the 
deceased at the Funeraria Nacio- 
I nal blocking traffic blocks away 
on either side of the parlor on 
Rizal Avenue. 

The burial, in obedience to the 
wishes of Nonong and Mrs. Nini 
Quezon Buencamino, surviving 
children of the former First Lady 
of the Land, will take place this 
afternoon, at four o'clock. 

Funeral arrangements were 
completed this morning in Mala- 
canan under the personal charge 
of former Speaker Yulo, as perso- 
nal representative of President F'pidio Quirino. 

Top government officials, the nation's top business and civic lead- 
ers and representatives of the common man whose welfare has been 
the life-long concern of the Quezon family will attend the funeral 
rites.

The ne'ws of the tragic incident 
swept the country yesterday with 
a blugeoning shock that people at 
i 1 it would refuse to believe the 
reports. 

The factory workers, the street 
cleaner, the lowly government em- 
ployee and the plain laborer whose 
lot have been ameliorated by the 
social justice program, inundated 
and carried out by the late Pre- 
sident Quezon, and the disaster 
victim whose spirit has been lift- 
ed by the mere mention of Dona 
Aurora's name, more than any one 
else feel the tragic loss. 

! Grief not less bitter than those , 
observed when the t death of Pre-; 
sident Quezon was announced 
swept the length and breadth of-] 
the land. 

The bodies of the Quezon fami- 
ly were transferred last night ! 
from the Funeraria Nacional to 
the UST chapel where people from 
all walks of life, in visible mourn- 
ing trek to view the remains of 
the beloved of the people. 

Masses for the deceased were 
said at the UST chapel from 6:00 
to 9:00- this morning. Bishop Ru- 

jfino Santos officiated at the 9:00 

| a.m. mass. Mons. Santos will al- 
so perform the last blessing at 

j the cemetery this afternoon. 

Only Nini Quezon Buencamino 
and her child, and Nonong Que- 
zon are the survivors of the il- 
lustrious family. 

First reports of the tragedy, 

were received in the citv when 
Governor Juan O. Chioco wired 

the department of the interior 
about the ambuscade. 



I 



i President Quirino directed the 
, Constabulary and the Army yes- 
terday to comb the areas around 
the ambush site, to locate the ban- 
dits or whoever perpetrated the 
dastardly deed. He also came 
down this morning for the fune- 
ral, and was present this morn- 
ing at the Sto. Tomas Universi- 
: ty chapel, where the bodies were 
removed and where requiem mas- 
! ses were held. A requiem mass 
was also said at the Gilmore Ave- 
nue home of the Quezons. 

General Rafael Jalandoni, for- 
mer AFP chief of staff, and once 
one of the protegees of the late 
First Lady, related in Malacanan 
last night, still in his bloodstain- 
ed polo shirt, how the dastardly, 
crime was perpetrated even as hej 
shouted out the name of Mrs. 
Quezon as leading the party. 
Dr. Eduardo Quisumbing, who 
i was also unhurt contrary to first 
'reports, was the cynosure of inte- 
rest in Funeraria Nacional last) 
rvght as he related his own ver- 
sion of the tragedy. 

Mrs. Nini Quezon Buencamino 
was rendered prostrate by the 
triple tragedy and she lay weep- 
ing all night, comforted by Sriends 
of the family. Nonong Quezon was 
aiso grief-stricken . the whole 
night long. 

Another person who miraculous- 
ly escaped unhurt was Hilarion 
layan, PACSA executive officer 
Two blowouts in his car, forcing 
him to change tires and be left 
behind, proved providential 



SURVIVORS' 
ACCOUNT OF 
AMBUSCADE 

Members of the motorcade that 
accompanied Dna. Aurora Ara- 
gon de Quezon' on a trip to Baler, 
Quezon, yesterday morning, who 
miraculously escaped alive from 
the fatal ambuscade which claim- 
ed the lives of 12 victims gave 
the STAR RFPORTER a vivid 
account of their harrowing expe- 
rience. 

Mrs. Quezon's car, which led 
.the motorcade, was negotiating a 
hilly bend when the first volley 
was fired by what was believed 
to be a Huk band of no less than 
100 strong. According to General 
ftafael Jalandoni, former PA 
chief of staff, che ambush was so 
swift that the PC escorts of the 
entourage had positivelv no op- 
portunity to jump in to the de- 
fense of -Mrs. Quezon. 

General Jalandoni said that he , 
and Mayor Ponciano Bernardo of 1 
Quezon City, who were then rid- 
ing with Mrs. Quezon, imme- 
diately jumped out of the besieg- 
ed car with hands up in the air. 
Mayor Bernardo shouted to the 
attackers that Mrs. Quezon was 
inside, probably in the belief that 
she would be spared by them. 

Before he could gather hid 
wits, however* Jalandoni stated 
that he was rendered unconscious 
bv a gun butt blow on the right 
cheek. When he came to, after 
; several minutes, Jalandoni found 
that all of his companions in the 
automobile were already dead, ex- 
cept Philip Buencamino, III, 
ymo was seriou c1 v wottncfod. On 
closer scrutiny, the retired army 
i boss further discovered that, the 
; attackers had .also relieved Mrs. 
I Ouc^on and the other victims of , 
th^ir jewelry and valuables. 

Mrs. Aroparo Aragon de An- 
gara, sister to Mrs. Quezon, de- 
f^p'od that she was riding in a 
j patfon wae-on som^ four or five 
i rnr? behind tha* of Mrs. Quezon.,

Shocked at the massacre, 




line up streets to watch 




After the Roxas funeral, whose procession to the cemetery was the longest 
ever yet seen in the city, Manilans did not expect so big a turnout in many 
a year. But only a year after, one did turn up on city streets. And it 




was all the more impressive because there were no preparations like the 
Roxas funeral march. Along sidewalks and on window sills the big throng

Silencio!... Pasa D >fia Aurora.. 



So ha cometido el crimen mas 
^rande en Filipinas! Ya no se 
puede cometer otro crimen ma- 
yor. Y la victima ha sido Dona 
Aurora, su hija "Baby" y su yer- 
no. Otros mas han perecido en 
la tragedia. 

Dofia Aurora era la Madre de 
los Filipinos. Y los Filipinos y 
la asesinaron. Ella era la Ma- 
dre de todos los pobres. Su 
carino, su bolsa y su mesa, 
siempre dispuestos para el dcs- 
graciado que acudia a ella. ;Ella 
era una sefiora majestuosa! La 
caridad se dibujaba en su ros- 
tro. 

Hemos presenciado su entierro 
Desfilaba silenciosamente, dolo- 
rosamente. Dos mujeres, mujeres 
sencillas, Uoraban en silencio a su 
paso. Los niiios contemplaban 
el cortejo funebre curiosos, pero, 
lividos, los ojos tristes. Parecian 
darse perfecta cuenta de la gran 
tragedia que atraviesa la Na- 
cion . . . 

A mi lado, una anciana de as 



pecto provinciano, tenia el rosa- 
rio colgando entre sus manos jun- 
tas. Rezaba. Cuando paso Dona 
Aurora, la oi musitar: "Ten mi- 
sericordia, Seiior, por el alma de 
Aurora"... tuve ganas de llorar. 
En efecto, el corazon me oprimia. 
Me ialtaba la respiracion. Tan- 
tas cosas tristes en mi derredor. 
Las lagrimas de una vecina ro- 
daban silenciosamente. La tarde 
estaba triste tambien. Infinita- 
mente triste. ; Silencio... pasa 
Doiia Aurora! Habia dlcho al 
guien a algunos chiquillos que 
discutian sobre "aquella era Doiia 
Aurora", "aquella era Baby" y 
"aquel era Felipe Buencamino". 
; Silencio... pasa Dofia Aurora!— 
repitio la misma voz, mientras un 
anciano muy bien vestido rezaba 
"Padre Nuestro quo Estas En 
Los Cielos; . 

Mas tarde, el pueblo se dara 
cuenta de la ausencia de Dofia 
Aurora. De su triste, dolorosa 
ausencia. 

GASTON 





•voiced a sympathy and grief that welled up in them with the realisation 
that not even a lovable figure, the widow of a late beloved, was free from 
insecurity. Calloused by the nasty experience of war, cynical over daily 





out of sheer devotion. It might just as well be a kind of wistful prayer 
for themselves, and for the nation whose foundations laid by Queson had 
been cracking to the noise of Congress disputes and unlicensed firearms. 



HP O the people whose nation it was his destiny to 
X mould into a state, Manuel L. Quezon became a 
symbol of their aspirations whom they readily ac- 
cepted to be one who belongs to the ages. As though 
it were his creation, his country seemed to mirror all 
his qualities— his self-confidence, his quick temper, 
his stubbornness. He was a man whose name they 
had learned to swear by, whose shades they called up, 
whose standard they gauged his successors by. 

That is why the happy faces pictured on this 
page — his wife's and two daughters' — kept filling with 
pride whenever grouped around the living man 
(above) or, with Quezon already gone, when they 
posed beside a portrait or a bust of him. If his fa- 
ther had gone the hard way steering his country's 
course, young Quezon {left) would be at it too, if in 
a negative manner. 

To the family he had left, Quezon had given 
prestige, dignity and, above all r his own name. Be- 
cause they could not help reflecting his glory, wher- 
ever they went the Quezon family seemed to walk 
in the shadow of the great man, and his people res- 
pected and accorded them a recognition such as has 
never been given any other family. People heeded 
the words of Dona Aurora and whether it was poli- 
tics or charity campaigns she was in, they responded 
to her call. Always hovering around her were poli- 
tical hopefuls, many of whom she had launched to a 
successful career. She had built the Philippine Na- 



tional Red Cross into the biggest charity organization 
in the country. In public ceremonies, she cut an in- 
dispensable figure, and her mere presence endowed 
any event with dignity, decorum and honor. Every- 
where she was welcomed with the same warmth and 
spontaneity that she used to be greeted with when 
her husband was still alive. To occasions intended 
to perpetuate his memory, like the one pictured at 
right, she was certain to be invited, as though it 
would lose all meaning if she was not around. 

To Baler three days ago, in the remote northern 
strip of the province renamed after her husband, Dona 
Aurora went on a trip, along with daughter Baby and 
a party of friends, to officiate in one such occasion. 
She would have given anything to be there — Baler 
was her own hometown, and for the first time in 
Baler history, a marker would be unveiled on the 
very spot, where Quezon was born. 

She didn't make it; three kilometers from . Baler, 
the motor party was ambushed over frenetic protests 
that Dona Aurora and Baby Quezon were in it. 
As the news reached them, a vague rumor at first, 
then an incredulous news story that required news- 
paper extras, a scandalized nation wondered what 
could be wrong — and how much farther it could be 
wrong — with a country in which two Quezons were 
murdered in cold blood. , Perhaps by force of habit, 
they again swore by Quezon's name, called up his 
shades, gauged his successors by his standard. 




Huk, PC or 
To Quezon he had no name 



The men on this page were first in the heart of the gteat Queaon. They had no 
names; to him a tao was neither Huk. PC nor civilian— he was a friend. He 
took Malacaiian to that friend frequently. He stayed in a Palace, rode in a 
limousine or sailed in a yacht, but he lived with them. At least, that was how 
he impressed his people. In him and his wife, the tao had two friends. When 
Queaon died, there was left only one. But his widow turned out to be the equi- 
valent of two. Wherever she went— as a Red Cross manager, a church worker, 
a social representative, or merely a neighbor, she carried perpetually the me- 
mory of Que2on. 

It was the biggest tragedy for the Philippines that one such tao, or group 
of taos, misguided, misdirected and crazed, ambushed her party and killed her, 
her daughter, her son-in-law, and nine others, and incidentally also killed the 
respect of her people for these elements. sea^ 




Baby Quezon looks up and across sun-glasses as^J. Amado Araneta tells her 
to look "pretty please." Baby's daytime and date-time dress is a skirt- 
\and-blouse affair" — the skirt, the kind that swirls about the knees, the 
blouse, the feminine kind with ruffles, peter-pan collar and long sleeves*

Marquez said the personnel of ; 
the department of agriculture and 
public works joined Mrs. Quezon 
; in different missions. He said the] 
public works officials were schej 
duled to inspect irrigation and] 
flood control, while the agricul- 
ture officials were on a seven-day 
inspection of a land for mecha- 
nized farming and general food . 
production. * 

Another eyewitness who was in 
the thick of the ambush but who I 
miraculously survived is Joaquin ! 
Villadelgado, chauffeur of Mrs. a 
Quezon since 1946. After the 
shooting, he drove the jeep he was 
driving to Cabanatuan and later 
from Cabanatuan to Manila alone. 

He arrived at Malacanan short- 
ly before 8 p. m., his khaki shirt 
and pants splattered with blood 
stains. He said there were three , 
others with him in the jeep, which 
was the fourth vehicle from Mrs. 
Quezon's car. Two of his passen- 
gers were killed but one, whose 
name he did not know, survived 

The youthful, chauffeur said the 
convoy was going up a hill along a 
zig-zag road at kilometer 168 
when the ambuscade took place. 
Firing was from the elevated 
ridges on both sides of the road, 
but the chauffeur said "bullets 
came from all directions.' In the 
first volley he saw Col. San 
Agustin and his lone companion in 
the jeep just ahead of his, killed | 

in The t chauffrur said that when 
he realized it was an ambush he 
jumped out of the car into a di ch 
on the side of the road. After the 
firing had died down, an armed 
man came and stood right over 
him and poised his rifle to shoot

AURORA VDA. DE QUEZON 

Jalandoni Y 
La Emboscada 





La Tragedia Segun 
Relatsn Testigos 

• Una verdadera camiceria fue 
,1a que hicieron los Huks en las 
personas, que iban en el coche 
de Dona Aurora Aragon Vda. de 
Quezon durante la emboscada, 
que tuvo lugar ayer mariana en 
la carretera entre Baler y Bon- 
gabon, segun la descripcion de los 
supervivientes, que llegaron ano- 
che a Manila acompanando los 
siete cadaveres, que fueron lle- 
vados a la Funeraria Nacional a 
eso de las 7:00 p.m. 

La Sra. De Sixto de la Costa, 
Amparo Aragon Vda. de Angaya, 
el Dr. Vicuna, la Sra de Ma- 
ximo Rodriguez, el Dr. Eduardo 
Quisumbing, (a quien se conto 
entre los muertos), la Srta. En- 
riqueta Amador, y otros llegaron 
anoche. 

El relato de los supervivientes 
fue que la comitiva estaba com- 
puesta de 14 coches y "jeeps" que j 
partieron de Manila con rumbo 
a Baler. Cerca ya de la linea di- 
visoria de la provincia de Quezon, 
y estando aun en territorio de 
Nueva Ecija, los pasajeros de los 
coches oyeron la primera descar- 
ga. El coche de Dona Aurora fue 
el que recibio por delante los ba- 
lazos de las ametralladora de los 
disidentes. El choferfue mortal- 
mente herido y detuvo el coche. 
Dona Aurora se reclino a un lado 
con un balazo en la cabeza. Esta- 
ba muerta. El Alcalde Bernardo 
se asomo la vcntanilla para gri- 
tar a los atacantes que se acer- 
caban al coche, que Dona Aurora 
Vda. de Quezon estaba dentro del 
vehiculo. La lespuesta fue otra 
descarga de los que componian el 
grupo Huk. 

Mientras caian muerto el Al- 
calde Bernardo, Baby, y el cho- 
fer, fue cuando el General Rafael 
Jalandoni, que estaba dentro del 
vehiculo, cogio una ametrallado- 
dora de mano y trato de bajar del 
coche para hacer frente a los 
Huks, que rodeaban el vehiculo. 
Un culatazo en la cabeza le hizo 
caer sin sentido al general. 

Despues de matar a todos los 



que iban en el coche de Dona 
Aurora, los Huks despojaron a 
Dona Aurora y a Baby de las al- 
hajas que llevaban y a los horn- 1 
ores tambien. Solo el General 
Jalandoni quedo con vida por ha- 
bersele tornado por muerto. 

Los otros coches a las primeras 
descargas pudieron volver y re- 
troceder pues el camino iba zig- : 
zagueado. La escolta de consta- 
bularios que iba en un "jeep" ba- ! 
jo el Teniente Lasam hizo frente 
a la gruesa banda de Huks. El j 
Teniente Lasam y tres de sus sol- j 
dados cayeron muertos al primer ; 
encuentro. Los otros soldados 
continuaron atrincherados resis- 
tiendo el fuego de los Huks hasta 
que llegaron refuerzos. 

En el relato de los supervivien- 
tes anoche se echaba de ver que 
los Huks sabian quicnes eran U 
que iban en el coche de Dona Au- 1 
rora, cuando asesinaron a los que 
sobrevivieron a la primera des- 
carga de la emboscada. 

Los cadaveres que llegaron] 
anoche, fueron los de Dna. Auro- 
ra, Baby, Alcalde Bernardo, PriJ 
mitivo San Agustin, Antonio San, 
Agustin, el de Felipe Buencamino ! 
III y el chofer. 

Felipe Buencamino murio ayer 
tarde en el hospital provincial 
de Cabanatuan, debido a las heri- 
das sufridas. Antes de expirar 
Uamo a la Srta. Amador y le dijo 
en ingles: "Take care of my darl- 
ing! (Cuida de mi amada), refi- 
riendose a su esposa Nini Que- 
zon. Esta quedo postrada ayer 
mafiana al ser informada de la 
muerte de su madre, pero hasta 
anoche no se le habia informado 
del triste final de su esposo. 

Miles de curiosos y simpatiza-' 
dores, amigos y parientes de lor 
Aragon y Quezon llenaron la 
Funeraria Nacional mucho antes 
de Hegar los cadaveres.

Leading members of the Senate today urged that 
martial law be declared in central Luzon which is 
admittedly a dissident-infested area and that dras- 
tic measures be taken to restore peace and order. 
Among those loudest in their demand for martial 
law were Senators Tomas Cabilt and Jose O. Vera. 

Meanwhile, Senator Pablo Angeles David today 
demanded the resignation of Secretary of Interior 
Sotero Baluyut. "It is the only step he can take if 
he would keep his self-respect," said David. "Ba- 
luyut and his group in Pampanga have been too busy 
playing politics to attend to the peace and order 
situation." 

On the other hand, Senator Prosp ero Sanidad 
blamed the Nacionalistas for the Huk outrages. The 
record shows that the Nacionalistas and the Demo- 
cratic Alliance have been supporting the Huks, Sa- 
nidad claimed. 

Army Gives Aid 

The Philippine Army has decided to help the 
constabulary in wiping out the dissidents in Central 
Luzon, the department of the interior announced this 
morning. 

The joint operations will be for the purpose of 
"ending it all," referring to the lawlessness in Cen- y 
I tral Luzon. 

The aid of the army was decided at a conference 
between President Quirino and Secretaries Ruperto 
Kangleon of national defense and Sotero Baluyut of 
the interior yesterday, the department of the Interior

campaign was launched today 
against Central Luzon rebels 
who killed Mrs. Aurora Quezon, 
widow of the Philippines' lirst 
president, and eleven r.tbera 
when they were ambushed ; n a 
motorcade yesterday. 

Ten other nersom were woun-

President Elpidio Quirino

rino's order repotted issued In 
Baguio for an all-out drive 
against the dissidents, tanks, ar- 
tillery and armored cars rolled 
nearer to Huk entrenchments, 
Army planes scoured the Sierra 
Madrc area for signs of the dis- 
sidents. 

The Armed Forces of the Phil- 
ippines tied in plans for the drive 
in conjunction with the constab- 
ulary. Brig. Gen. Calixto Duque, 
AFP deputy chief of fctaff, urged 
a drastic "zoning" program in the 
dissident area for total extermi- 
nation of the Huks, 

Suspicion brewed among solons 
today that the fatal ambuscade 
was a deliberate Plan to murder 
Mrs. Aurora Quezon and? her 
family by former tenants on the 
Quezon family's Arayat hacienda 
who have turned Huks. 

Meantime, an opinion was ex- 
pressed that disgruntled former 
tenants of the one-time Quezon 
hacienda in Pampanga were re- 
sponsible for the outrage. 

Indications were shown that 
the ambuscade was deliberately 
planned for the extermination of 
the Quezon family. 

Countries all over the world 
expressed shock and dismay over 
the murder of Mrs. Quezon. 
Messages of condolence poured 
into the foreign office from such 
governments as Australia. 

The sneak attack took place 
in barrio Salubusob, 62 kilome- 
ters away from Bongabon, Nue- 
va Ecija, Col. Macario Asistio of 
the PC disclosed this morning 
as he left for the ambush scene. 

Information reaching PC 
headquarters said that about 300 
dissidents participated In the 
ambush. They were led by 
Commanders Viernes, iVIarzon, 
Lupo, and Mulong. 

A combined PC-AFP force 
estimated at 1,600 is participat- 
ing in the manhunt. Reports 
that PC troops had contacted 
the fleeing dissidents were con- 
firmed this morning. No de- 
tails were available although 
"fighting was in progress." 

Tanics at the PC headquarters 
compound and in the Southern ! 
Luzon Zone command in Balara, j 
Quezon City, were ordered last 
fiight to proceed to Nueva Ecija. I 
About 1,000 PC troops from the 
1st combat oattalion were alerted I 
for the all-out offensive against j 
the Nueva Ecija dissidents. 

Gov. Joan O. Chioco of Nueva ! 
Ecija ordered town mayors, police • 
agencies and civilian guards in the i 
province to press the manhunt j 
for the am bushel's. 

Rep. Justiniano Montano (L, 
Cavite), today whipped up con-! 
gress sentiment for immediate' 
merger of the armed forces and 
the constabulary as th e gbvern- ' 
xnent's answer to renewal of Huk ; 
[ambuscades that culminated in a 
, near-massacre of Mrs. Aurora j 
Quezon's party yesterday. 

Rep. Manuel Soza (L, Cebu) , I 
said "the sentiment in congress is t 
'for hiking appropriations for the 
, constabulary" to put an end to or- I 
jganized dissidence. 
I "I think congress will act quick- ' 
ly on current proposals to hike 1 
outlays for this purpose," he em- 
phasized. 

Some solons demanded BrigaH 
iier General Rafael Ramos, PC 
T-f of staff, be placed on' the! 
not lor ravins PC patrol :u- 
ties. despite • constaift kw„., s 
"Antral Luzon governors "Cor 
' tistance. 



0>ner solons, particularly Reps .j 
Eduardo Barretto (L. Laguna) ; 
pacifico Lim (L, Sorsogon), and: 
Pedro Mimoz (L, Batangas) urged 
a probe of the PC commands in 
Cabanatuan and Quezon. 

They said that the PC troops 
there should have cleared the way 
first for the party, knowing the 
highway was very unsafe and lit- 
tle used because holdups and kill- 
ings were frequently . committed 
there . 

Senators and congressmen led 
the country in expressing shock 
and grief at yesterday's tragedy. 

Senate President Mariano Je- 
gus Cuenco, mourning the death 
of Mrs. Quezon and others in. the 
hands of Huks, declared the gov- 
ernment must continue without 
letup its war against Huks and 
bandits. 

Last night PC headquarters an- 
nounced tnat a constabulary force 
had contacted the ambush band 
near the scene of the attack. A 
pitched battle is in progress, it was 

said. . 

Senator Pablo Angeles David, 
one time governor of Pampanga, 
and one of the arch enemies of 
the Hukbalahaps, said that know- 
ing the Huks as he does he is in- 
clined to believe that the band 
which ambushed Mrs. Quezon and 
her party are members of the 
Hukbalahaps and not mere ban- 
dits as the PC chief would want 
to believe. 

"I do not think the Huks would 
not v have attacked if they knew 
that the party was that of Mrs. 
Quezon. As far as I understand 
the Huks, they are out to kill 
anyone who are not one of their 
kind. Anybody who is not a mem- 




Mrs. AURORA A. QUEZON 

ber of the organization is a want- 
ed man," David declared.' 

David blames the poor intelli- 
gence system of the constabulary 
for being ignorant of the move- 
ment of the dissidents, specially 
the Nueva Ecija command "who 
should know what is going on 
within their territory." 

The Pampanga senator took a 
dig at his political rival, Interior 
Secretary Sotero Baluyut, for 
making the people believe that 
peace and order has been restored 
in Central Luzon. 

"Only officials like Baluyut who i 
have not lived in Central Luzon 
ca ; n say that the Huk problem is 
solved/ 1 he said. • ' * 

^. Da 7 i A d 1 '. in conver sations with PC 
Chief Alberto Ramos this morning ! 
advocated an oil-out offensive = 
against dissident elements and i 
leave no more quarters this 
time," he said. 

''If the Hukbalahaps sneak no 
other language but force, the gov- i 
eminent must speak the same lan- j 
; guage to make itself understood," ' 
he emphasized. 

SPC Chairman Jose c. Zulueta, 
m an interview with the Evening 
News said peace and order in the 
' country v : ; ueial." He stress 

| ed that peace cannot be restored 
P1 ? Gnt wave ™g policy 
of the department of the interior 
*• *2 ated -officials in 




the government cnargca with the 
duty of restoring and maintaining 
peace and order and who, through . 
their pronouncements, have blind- 
ed* the people into believing that 
peace and order has been re- 
stored." 

Zulueta 's statement was prompt- 
ed by the killing of Mrs. Quezon. 
The SPC boss is the godson of 
the late President and Mrs. Que- 
zon. His eyes moist with tears, 
Zulueta refused to talk further on 
peace and order "lest it might be 
misinterpreted as a political 
.stunt/' 

He .scouted talks that Huk 
groups are now disorganized, say- 
ing they are as well-organized, if 
mot better organized now than be- 
fore. The SPC chief said he had 
pleaded with officials to tell the 
people actual peace conditions. 

Of Mrs. Quezon's death, Zulue- 
ta said: "I mourn her death deep- 
ly. The late President and Mrs. 
Quezon were to me, like my own 
father and mother." 

The death of Mrs. Quezon 
caused immediate political reper- 
cussions, with President Quirino's 
candidacy suffering the brunt of 
adverse effects. 

Quick to see a strong point in 
their Ic 1 or, anti-Quirino elements, 
led by suspended Senator Jose 
Avelino, and Nacionalista bigwigs, 
with Minority Floor Leader Cipria- 
no Primicias leading the attack, 
assailed the administration's peace 
and order campaign and indirect- 
ly blamed Quirino for the death 
of Dona Aurora. The attacks 
centered on Quirino's recent fire- 
I side chat, delivered less than two 
, wee&s ago in which the President 
declared that peace and order has 
been completely restored tnrough- 
I out the country. They pointed out 
that Quirino's statement was not 
a true picture of the peace and 
: order situation and gave citizens 
a false sense of security. 

Even the man on the street, 
commenting freely on Mrs. Que- 
zon's death, showed unrestrained 
contempt for the government's I 
peace and order campaign and in- 
creased hatred for dissident ele- j 
! ments. Taxi drivers talking among I 
themselves as they hurriedly sip- i 
ped their morning coffee in cor- 
ner Chinese stores, low-salaried, j 
government employes riding in : 
jeeps on their way to office, labor- 
ers trodding the sidewalks and 
hugging their meager lunch wrap- 
ped in yesterday's newspaper to 
begin the day's toil, housewives 
going to market with their buri 
bags or baskets, — all sported 
gloomy faces and were of heavy 
heart. They, too, expressed bitter- 
ness over the failure of the admi- 
nistration to suppress banditry 
and lawlessness in the country. 

With such a strong current of 
adverse public opinion against the 
failure in the peace drive sweep- 
ing the country like a prairie fire 
on a summer day, it is generally 
believed that Quirino's chances of 
reelection will be greatly set back. 

Meanwhile, the lower house met 
in early session at 3 p.m. to enact 
a resolution of condolence over the 
death of Mrs. Quezon and her 
daughter. 

After brief eulogies the solons 
adjourned to attend the funeral. 

The solons, he-ied by Speaker 
Eugenio Perez, heaid muss offered 
by Monsignor Sancho for Mrs 
Quezon, Baby Quezon, and Philip 
Buencamino III, Mayor Ponciano 
Bernardo, ffcfl other victims at the 
Santo Tomas university chapel 
this morning. 

Rep. Vicente Logart*. (N Cebu) 
recalled that when the late Pres 

hl e H n ; ST on was StiU livin ^ he! 

had told tenants on their lOu-hec- 
tere^Arayat.farm in Pampanga ! 



model fan 
j After liberation, however, Mrs. 
! Quezon and her children sold this 
j hacienda to the Rural Progress ad- 
ministration for P60C000. 
j It was possible, ether solons 
j averred, that change in ownership 
worked towards dispossession of 
some tenants. These must have 
become disgruntled and turned 
Huks, carrying resentments against 
the Quezon family. 

Even Hilarion Sil&yan, who was 
with the Quezon party, disclosed 
today his belief that it was a 
planned attack. 

The Huks apparently knew Mrs. 
Quezon because the Huks even ut- 
tered her name and pointed her 
out to other companions as the 
lady with the white hair. 

Silayan disclosed that the am- 
bushing Huks let pass two jeeps 
heavily loaded with PC soldiers 
before stopping the cavalcade 
headed by Mrs. QuezonS car. 
The sudden appearance of the 
two PC jeeps when firing started 
prevented Huks from mowing 
down the other members of the 
Quezon motorcade, Silayan 
averred. 

Brig. Gen. Calixto Duque.. APP 
deputy chief of staff, said this 
morning he advocates "zonifica- 
t tion" of Huk areas to apprehend 
| the killers of the Quezon family, 
i "There ca<n> be no half-way 
! measures now," Duque added. 
! 'They have proved that they de- 
serve to be killed one by one." 

, Foreign Undersecretary Felino 
| Neri today declared that since the 
Bongabon tragedy in which Mrs. 
I Aurora A. Quezon and companions 
1 lost their lives became known, rhe 
department has been continually 
swamped by messages of sympathy 
and condolence from government 
and private sources abroad. The 
goodwill and friendship that the 
Philippines now enjoys with the 
other nations 4 'is in a measure due 
to the foundations laid down by . 
the late President Quezon especial- 
ly during the war years," he said. 

Among the first foreign govern- ' 
ments to transmit diplomatic notes 
of condolence was Australia. The 
Australian note was handed this 
morning personally to Neri by 
Consul-General John K. Waller. ! 
Its full text foilov/s: 

"The Australian Government 
and People have learnt with deep 
horror of the "murder of the wi- 
dow of ycur beloved leader. The 
death of one who has played such 
a part in the development of the 
Philippine republic and who was 
so intimately connected for many 
years with its most historic mo- 
ment is a bereavement which will 
be felt by every Filipino. We join 
with you ^n mourning the loss of 
one w r ho was beloved by all who 
knew her. 

In the meantime, Consul Sofro- 
nio Abrera of the Philippine con- 
sulate at Los Angeles, California, 
cabled the home office that 
all the Los Angeles newspapers 
played up in "banner stories" the 
tragedy, recalling how the late Pre- 
sident Quezon and his family made 
their home at Los Angeles during 
the last war. Filipinos and Ameri- 
cans in Southern California shared I 
a common sorrow, and at the same 
time strong? y urged strong reprisal 
measures against the authors of 
the gruesome tragedy, according to I 
Abrera. 
The Neri statement follows: 
"Foremost among the deeds for* 
which cur people shall long re-C 
member Mrs. Aurora Aragon Que- 
zon is the indefatigable zeal and 
• utter unselfishness with which shej^ 
ihas pursued the work began bfl

How It Happened: 



More Photos OnA^b^dT 



A reconstruction of the ambus- 
cade on Mrs. Quezon's party as 
gleaned from reports of * ne 
ning News correspondent m Nueva 
Ecija and from accounts ot eye- 
witnesses follows: f , flS 
The site of the sneak attack was 
in barrio Salubusob on a bend 
on the Villa Aurora . *«^g 
Bon-bon. It was near the ap- 
proaches to Baler ana within Nue. 
va Ecipa province. 

The ambush was sprung at iu.au 
| yesterday morning * 
1 The Quezon party was a motor- 
cade of several cars including two 
jeeps bearing constabulary men on 
security detail. The party was 
bound for Baler to attend cere- 
monies for the unveiling ofa 
marker which marks the birtn- 
place of the late President Quezon. 

Mrs. Quezon was in the first car, 
a Buick sedan owned by Mayor 
Ponciano Bernardo of Queozn City. 
At the wheels was Lt. Col. Antonio 
San Agustin. assistant manager of 
the Philippine Charity Sweep- 
stakes office. Seated on his rieht 
was Philip Buencamino III and to 
Philip's right was Baby Quezon. 

Seated in the rear were Mrs. 
Quezon, who was right behind San 
Agustin. Maj. Gen. Rafael Jalan- 
• doni, retired AFP chief of staff (in 
center), and Mayor Bernardo. 

The second vehicle was a jeep 
with a constabulary puard detail 
under the command cf Captain 
Olimpio Manalang. Pedro Payu- 
mo, Mrs. Quezon's cook, was in 
this car together with Cpl. Ray- 
mundo Silverio and other consta- 
bulary personnel. 

Third came a jeep with Juan 
Molina as driver. Beside him was 
seated Col. Primitivo fcan Agus- 
tin, chief of the military intel- 
ligence section, G-2, AFP. Seat- 
ed behind were five constabulary 
men . 

The fourth vehicle was a sta- 
tion wagon owned by Mrs. Quezon 
with Teodulo Villadelgado, No- 
nong Quezon's driver, and two pas- 
sengers whom the driver was un- 
able to identify. These passengers 
w^re killed. Villadelgado escaped) 
unhurt. 

The fourth car was occupied by j 
Dr. Eduardo Quisumbing, Dr. 
Francisco Bigornia, Dr Luis Alan- 
dy, and Mrs. Amparo A. Angara. 
Mrs. Quezon's sister. 

PACSA Director Hilarion Sila- 
yan's car was originally the third 
car in the line but was delayed by 
two flats on the vay and at the 
time of the incident was trailing 
two kilometers away. 

The party left Cabanatuan early 
in the morning at about 5 o'clock 

and at 10:30 reached a bend where! 

there Was a man standing in the 

middle of the road motioning them 

to stop. 

Ma^ or Bernardo, sensing that 
i some danger was afoct, shouted 
that the party was Mrs. Quezon's. 
This was answered by a sudden 
| volley concentrated on the first 
car. All persons m the car were 
killed except Jalandoni and Buen- 
camino, who was badly wounded 
in the chest. The attackers then I 
rushed at the car and as Jalandoni ' 
was making an effort to pull out 
his gun and fight he was hit on 
the face with a rifle butt and was 
downed unconscious. The general, 




f\ rhioco points to the bullet-ridden

rbin* Buencamino III, met death.

said that when he came to, the; 
bodies of Mrs. Quezon and Baby' 
Quezon were slumped on top of 
him. Apparently the Huks mis- 
took him for dead. 

Indications are that the bodies 
of all the occupants cf the first 
car were dragged outside and 
shorn of all jewelry. Jalandoni 
was divested of a Signet ring and 
his wallet. 

After the first volley which: 
crippled the "leading car Huk fire! 
was concentrated on the constab-j 
ulary guards. Capt. Manalang and 
Cpl. Silverio were able to escape 
death by jumping cut of their jeep 
and taking cover under the vehi- 
cle. Manalang was wounded in 
; the left leg and arms while Silve- 
I rio, who said he feigned death, was 
i wounded in the right leg. 



| The attack was so sudden, ac- 
cording to Jalandoni, that the 

] guards had no time to fire back. 

I As far as reports indicate, only! 

; three armed forces men survived I 
the ambush Jalandoni, Manalang,! 
and Silverio. The rest were killed, j 

I The identity of the ambush gang 

' as Huks was confirmed by drivers 

1 of the Cabanatuan Lumber com- 
pany who were ambushed on the 
same spot earlier. The drivers 
said that they wore detained by 
the Huks until the attack on the 
Quezon party was over, following 
which, they were released. One 

1 of the Huks. the diivevs said, told 
them* "Go now as your white- 
haired Mrs Quezon is already 

\ dead." 

I The driver of the -fourth car was 
; quick enough to back up his vehi- 



cle, make a U-turn and speed 
awky to safety and bring news of. 
the tragedy to Cabanatuan 

Several other cais at the tail of 
the party also we.-e able to make • 
a getaway. In one of these was] 
Director Silayan who sped to Bo- 
ngabon and was able to ask Capt, 
Domirador Alo's A Company, 1st 
combat battalion, PC tc rush to 
the scene. 

Seeing the reinforcements 
comeV the attackers scampered 
away. The bodies of the dead and 
wounded were then gathered and 
taken to Cabanatuan. 

News of the ambuscade reached 
i Col. Angel Magallanes. provincial 
commander, while he was confer- 
ring with Governor Juan O. Chio- 
co vesterday noon. Magallanes' 
immediately left taking along all 
available reinforcements and 
rushed to the scene of the am- 
bush. 

Chioco wired Secretary Sotero 
Baluyut for a reconnaissance 
plane to be dispatched to the area. 

The wounded arrived at the Ca- 
banatuan provincial hospital by 
mid-afternoon. A serious problem 
of blood plasma supply faced the, 
doctors. Jalandoni made an ef- 
fort to get a plane and fly Buen- 1 
camino to Manila. Buencamino 
however expired ?£ around 3:30. 

Mrs Enriqueta de Amador who 
was at Buencamino's bedside till 
the kst said that as Philip was 
about to die he said: "Enriqueta, 
please take good care of my dar- 
lings." Then he gasped, "My God," 
and d:ed. Earlier he asked for a 
priest. 

Quisumbing, who was earlier 
listed among the dead, surprised 
friends last night when he was 
among the men who bore Mrs. 
! Quezon's casket inco the Funeraria

Thousands Grieve as Bodies 
Of Quezons Are Laid to Rest 

A nation bowed its head in grief yesterday as Mrs. Aurora 
Quezon, her daughter Baby and her son-in-law 'Philip Bueneami- 
no III went to their final resting nlace 




JL.VST VIEW. — Kager to see caskets of the three, victims of 
the anihusciule as they were about to be placed at their Itiral 
resting place in 1 lie North Oeqietery, young ami old Hun- 
raviouslv to the railings of soine graveyardU Ihuwlmls upon 
lirtudieds lined the greets Hon-; miicti the funeral profession 
passed and more wen 1 at the Cemetery to attend lh<* last necro* 
logical rites in honor of the three;' 



f The remains of the three — in- 
nocent victims of a nameless 
crime — were interred side by 
side in the family plot at the 
North Ce/netery where the late 
President Manuel Quezon is en- 
tombed. 

Three hu.idred thousand peo- 
ple turned out yesterday either 
to take part in or witness the 
funeral cortege as it wended its 
wav slowly and solemnly from 
the University of Sto. Tomas 
chapel to the cemetery. Presi- 
dent Quirino walked part of the 
way immediately behind the fu- 
neral van. A great, number ot 
cars, estimated at no less than 
1,000, formed part of the pro- 
session. 



As early as 2 o'clock in the 
afternoon, thousands upon thou- 
sands gathered at the UST 
grounds, lined up both sides of 
the streets where the funeral 
would pass and filled the North 
Cemetery. The blazing sun beat 
down mercilessly on the milling 
crowd. But they stood their 
ground and waited patiently. 
Leaving the chapel at 4:30 o'- 
clock, the cortege reached the ce- 
metery at exactly & o'clock. 

At exactly 4 p.m., President 
Quuino accompanied by his 
daughter Vicky and aides-de- 
camp arrived at the U.S.T. cha- 
pel and knelt down before the 
chair which was especially pro- 
vided for him. The President 



According to Dr. 
one of the survivors, Mrs. Que 
zon was a£amst the plan of hav- 
< - •-•■tahuiary escorts; It 
was also learned that Philip 
Buencammo refused to go alonJ- 
with the party but was prevaif- 
ed uJ)on at the last minute 



was the principal pall bearer for 
Mrs. Quezon. In the morning, 
the President attended the re- 
quiem mass. He went direct to 
the chapel upon his return from 
Baguio. He left th e chapel fol- 
lowing the mass to meet his ca- 
binet at Malacanan. 

There was some difficulty at, 
the Quezon family burial i 
grounds. The crowd kept pour- 1 
mg in and :he police and cons-, 
tabulary soldiers spent quite a I 
time pushing their way in and 
clearing the way for the cortege. 

Suddenly, there was a hush 
and silence, broken only now and 
Mien by a stifled sob. * The peo- 
ple bowed their heads as pall- 
bearers carried in the caskets 
rue by one to the strains of 
" Nearer My God To Thee," play- 
ed by the constabulary band. 

Mrs. Quezon's remains came 
: first. Draped in a Filipino flag, 
her casket was laid a few feet 
from the gate of the Quezon bu- 
rial grounds to await her daugh- 
ter and Philip. Baby's coffin 
was carried by members of the 
Ylae, an organization of young 
ladies of which she was the pre^ 
sident; that of Philip by his fa- 
ther, sister and close relative?. 

As soon as the three caskets 
were laid side by side. Bishop 
Rufino Santos of Manila took 
his place at the head of the cas- 
kets and conducted the burial 
services. President Quirino, 
former Speaker Jose Yulo and 
other government officials and 
relatives of the dead stood on 
the opposite side. 

After t,he biers were blessed, 
the pall-bearefe once more lift- 
ed Mrs. Quezon casket and car- 
ried it to the niche that was 
still wet and soft built beside 
that of her husband. At exact- 
ly 6:15 it was slowly pushed in- 
to the crypt. 

Then with their eyes dimmed 
by tears, Baby's co-members of 
the Ylac, lifted her bier and 
slowly carried it to her assign- 
ed place on the far end of the 
lot. Philip's turn came later. 
Baby's and Philip's tombs were 
built side by side. 

At 6:20 the crowd slowly dis- 
persed, still with bowed heads. 

Among the early arrivals at 
the cemetery yesterday were 
Minister Thomas H. Dockett, 
Col. Andres Soriano, and top 
Philippine and < United States 
government officials. 

Also aeen among the thick 
crowd were Mrs. Trinidad L. 
Roxas and her daughter, Ruby, 
and the two. surviving Quezon 
children, Maria (Nini) Quezon- 
Jhiencamino and Manuel (No-

OLD FRIEND. — Simeon L. Lumanog, 89-year-old vt'erart of 
> the revolution and friend of the Quezon, was probably the oldest, per- 

» son in the UST chapel yesterday during the rites for the Quezons. 

i r He is from Lubao, Pampanga. On his right are Mrs. Jose C r Zulueta 
; and fri *nds. 



The Huks were reported to have 
I sustained heavy casualties, as 
judged from bloodstains found in 
the battle area. 

Two army Piper Cubs hovered 
over the battle scene since this 
morning. It was further learned 
that a squadron of fighter planes 
are standing by in Floridablafica, 
awaiting the signal for* action. 

Meanwhile, the body of Lieut. 
Deogracias M. Arabejo was recov- 
ered" from the scene of the ambush 
this morning and was transferred 
to Manila. It was further learned 
the body of Lieut. Joaquin R. 
Lasam, one of the PC escorts kill- 
ed, was looted by the Huks of 
P700. The automobile of Mayor 
Ponciano Bernardo, where Mrs. 
Quezon was killed, was towed to 
Cabanatuan. It was riddled by more 
than 30 bullet, holes. 

The provincial board of Xueva 
Eci.ia approved a resolution cf 
condolence over the death of Mrs. 
Quezon and the members of her 
part} r . The resolution was spon- 
sored by Member Meliton Rigor. 

Governor Juan O. Ghioco, who 
returned from Manila where he 
escorted the bodies of the am- 
bush victims, said this morning 
that the government should face 
the situation squarelv. The orin- 
clpal job of the PC, he stated, is 
to restore peace and order, after 
which the PACSA can enter the 
picture. 

"The top leaders of our gov- . 
ernment." the ' governor said, 
"should stop playing oolitics." 



Huks, the other members of the es- 
cort guard having either been 
ed or wounded, 

Badly wounded, Captain Mana- 
lang, his ammunition- exhausted, 
reserved his last bullet for any of 
the Huks who * might have come 
near him. Captain Fausto made 
It hot for the Huks, fighting sa- 
vagely behind a big trunk of a 
tree. 

Captain Manalang said the Hi 
in the ambush party suffered ca- 
sualties, claiming that Corporal 
Ra}-raundo Silveiio. also of the

the Huks before -. r r fell from a

dence that the massacre of Mrs. 
Aurora Aragon Quezon and the 
members of her party yesterday 
morning was premedidated and 
well-planned was furnished this

ambuscade upon receiving reports 
from Hilarion Silayan. executive 
officer of the PACSA, in Bonga- 
bong. 

His investigation disclosed, ac- 
cording to Captain Hernandez, 
that the Huks conceived and pre- 
pared the ambush the night pre- 
vious. They put up a barricade 
across the highway to Ba:er t Que- 
on, 15 meters from where one of 
the Huks stopped Mrs, Quezon's 
automobile. 

Material for the barricade was 
obtained by the Huks from two 
truckloads of lumber that the Huks 
seized when they held up the 
trucks the night previous to the 
ambuscade. 

Captain Hernandez said that th« 
men who killed Mrs. Quezon and 
the members of her party were 
Huks under the command of Com-

Supreme Honors Given 
Bom Aurora — Rests 
Beside MLQ Remains 

By JIM AUSTRIA 

Beneath Manila's sunset sky 
where, great drifts of pink-tinged 
clouds were gathered, Mrs. Ma- 
nuel Quezon, martyr of the . peo- 
I pie's cause, was laid to rest at 
. ; nine minutes past six yesterday 
i afternoon in a concrete tomb by. 
i the side of her husband, the 
President who lived and died 
fighting for the same ideal. 

With supreme honors from the 
j government and its people, the 
j remains of the Philippines, former 
First Ladj r were borne from the 
7.UST chapel to their final resting 
place along a crowded . route 
: where a sorrowing thro nix of 
•300,000 bowed their heads "in ^tri- 
bute as the hearse rolled past. 

Her bronze casket was draped 
with a silken tricolor, S3 v mbbiic 
of the nation's acknowledgment 
of her greatness. Behind her 
;followed the bodies of her daugh- 
ter, Maria Aurora, and her son- 
in-law, Felipe Buencamino III, 
who together with her had bean 
sacrificed to an outrage without 
parallel. 

Throughout the country,, the 
Philippine flag flew at half-mast. 

Preceded by mournful dirges, 
'the three caskets arrived at the 
cemetery at the precise hour of 
six. minutes after two succeed- 
ing lightnings had forked against 
the sunset, followed by rolls of 
ithunder which set the people 
jto thinking dark forbidding, 
thoughts. 

There was intense emotion as 
the hearses stopped and the 
band played "Nearer »My God To 
Thee", while muted sobs broke 
from the First Lady's sister, Mrs. 
Amparo' Angara. 

Men, women and children num- 
bering upwards of 100.000 surged 
about the little space between 
the mausoleums of Presidents 
Quezon and Roxas where the cas- 
kets were gently lowered. A 
good number recalled •how - ^ x acfr l y 
one year and three ; . rlays ago 
they had =<<->od on ainiast the 
same spot under the acacia frees 
to bury a President. 

When the last notes of the 
hymn had blown away, a sudden 
stillness came upon ~ crowd 
and President Elpidio « Quirino, 
other dignitaries and relatives cf 
the dearl took their places for the '

' Mrs. Quezon's casket broke down 
i and had to be pushed .all the way

Observers estimate the funeral 
crowd to be about two-thirds of 
that which turned out at President 
Roxas* rites. The funeral in April 
last year was witnessed by more 
than a million citizens. 

Now, as then, people perched 
atop neighboring mausoleums, 
trees flowered with cameramen 
and other spectators. There were 
no fainting cases reported, how-, 
ever. An overcast sky, abetted byf 
lighting and thunder. tjar£atened 
rain, but the weather remain ed 
calm. 

Admirers of the late First Lady, I 
who now occupies a definite place 
in Philippine history, broke into 
the mausoleum area after the ce-

few broke off flowers' from the

UNA ENTREVISTA CON 




Activa y energica siempre, Dna. Aurora, como Presidenta 
de la Cruz Roja Nacional, no cesaba en su labor en pro de esta 
organizacion humanitaria que tan dignamente encabezaba. 

§ Es Muv Dificil Que Dna. Aurora 
Pueda Morir 3ui Haber Muerto 
Antes En Nuestros Corazones". 

/\ntt5£> ^ la Cruz Roja para extender o 

mejorar la organizacion? 

— Muchos, pero por ahora pre- 
fiero no hablar de ellos. Poco a 
poco y a medida que se vaya pre- 
sentando la oportunidad de reali- 
zarlos podremos darlos a publici- 
dad De todos modos puede usted 
estar seguro que no descansamos 
y que todos nuestros esfuerzos 
estan encaminados hacia el en- 
grandecimiento y prosperidad de 
]a Cruz Roja para que en el fu- 
turo sus servicios a la humanidad 
que sufre, sean ciento por ciento 
eficientes. . . 



Me recibio atenta, como yo 
esperaba, con sonrisa satis- 
fecha de mujer que, con la 
mente apartada de las vam- 
dades esteriles de la vida, se 
dedica de lleno a laborar en 
pro de la humanidad dohente. 

— Se que la voy a. distraer 
linos momentos y que para 
uSed, senora, son momentos 
preciosos, pero me sabta ais 
nensar, estoy seguro pues mi 
obieWo es precisamente po- 
; ner de relieve su labor en pro 
del que sufre... 

Pero Dna. Aurora no me dejo 
lerminar. Sonriendose, como ella 
sabe sonreir, me dijo: 

_ Dejese de cumplidos y vamos 
al grano. ^En que puedo ser- 
; virle? — - 

__ E n mucho, senora, si no tiene 
inconveniente. En pnmer lugar

^ ser mejor. Se ve que 

^ ; sieue teniendo corazon,

apesar de todo. 

ha ad - 
^Que proyectos nuevos tiene 



Asi debio haber comenzado poco 
mas o menos, esta entrevista con 
Dna. Aurora A. de Quezon, de 
haberse llevado a cabo. Pero des- 
^raciadamente no fue asi. No me 
cupo tal suerte. 

La ultima vez que vi a Dna. 
Aurora fue en una de las con- 
ferencias que dio en Manila el 
Blanco Soler, el eminente me- 
y conferenciante espanol. 
cia mdcho que no la veia y 
esta vez me dejo hpndamente im- 
presionado. Nunca, con anterio- 
ridad, la vi tan majestuosa tan 
digna, tan Dena de encantadora 
sencillez... No pude menos de 
pensar en que si dejo de serlo en 
jerarquia, seguia siendo en apa- 
riencia la primera dama de Fill- 



Dr. 
dico 
Hacia 



pmas. 



Fue entonces cuando se me 
ocurrio pedirla una entrevista pa- 
ra La Voz de los Domingos. A 
la primera oportunidad y esto fue 
hace una semana, me presente en 
las oficinas de la Cruz Roja y 
pregunte por Diia. Aurora. Me 
respondieron que aun no habia 
vuelto de Baguio. Deje entonces 
mi nombre y el encargo de que 
hicieran el favor de avisarme tan 
pronto como llegara, pues queria 
que me arreglaran una en- 
trevista con ella. Me prometie- 
ron hacerlo. 

Pero Dna. Aurora ya no volvio. 
Una bala traidora arranco de 
fell cuerpo la vida que le era aun 
tan necesaria, que tan preciosa 
era para su pueblo. 

Como presidenta de la Cruz 
Roja Nacional de Filipinas su la- 
bor ha sido admirable y como 
laborante social, en general, no 
tenia precio . . . Activa siempre, 
bonachona siempre, y siempre 
digna, encabezo otras actividades 
importantes cuyo unico objetivo 
eran socorrer al necesitado y ali- 
viar al que estaba en el dolor . . . 
Catolica y recta en sus obras, 
dulce y caritativa, Dna. Aurora 
fue el pano de lagrimas de su 
pueblo... como recto y empren- 
dedor y caudillo modelo fue el 
esposo que la precedio al otro 
mundo . . . 

Si las esposas heredan las vir- 
tudes de sus esposos, diriase que 
Dna. Aurora heredo del gran cau- 
dillo la energia, la decision y la 
contundente personalidad que tan- 
to caracterizaron al finado Ma- 
nuel Quezon. 

Y es triste pensar que manos 
filipinas quitaron la vida a esta 
filipina ilustre que quiso tanto e 
hizo tanto por su Filipinas .>. . Nos 
queda el consuelo, sin embargo, 
de que los asesinos de Dna. Au- 
rora son un punado de hombres 
sin ley, y que todo el pueblo, 
dolorido, llora hoy la muerte de 
su primera Primera Dama... 

Y que del brazo otra vez de su 
esposo, "alia en donde el que reina 
es Dios" Dna. Aurora seguira 
guiando espiritualmente la espiri- 
tualidad de la mujer filipina... 

Pues es muy dificil que Dna. 
Aurora pueda morir sin haber 
muerto antes en nuestros cora- 
zones... Y en nuestros corazones, 
vivira siempre nuestra inolvida- 
ble primera Primera Dama...

Woman Sense 

Uie Viewpoint Of A Filiping 
By PURA SANTILLAN OASTRENQM 



It is very ironical that members 
of the family of the man who so 
articulately enunciated and so sin- 
cerely worked for social justice 
in the Philippines during his life- 
time should be the victims of peo- 
ple purportedly fighting to carry 
out that principle. President Que- 
zon's name was inextricably linked 
with the ideal of fairness and 
equity for the masses and Mrs. 
Quezon's work and interests 
showed that she shared that ideal. 
Mrs. Pecson was right when she 
said that her assailants lost a 
stout friend when they killed her, 
and the Philippines a great leader. 

Quite apart from the sincere 
sorrow felt over losing such splen- 
did pillars of Philippine citizenry 



(and this includes ' the constab- 
ulary men and other members of 
the party, who died without being 
able to defend themselves), the 
nation's shock also stems out of 
the fact that apparently outlawry 
and banditry in this countrv have 
grown to such an extent that there 
is no safety of the road even for 
men and women of peace. The 
mention of Mrs. Quezon's name, 
according to the radio reports, 
seemed to infuriate, rather than 
appease the bandits who became 
even more violent after hearing it. 

While saying a prayer for the 
innocent victims of that blood- 
curdling assault, the country may 
well say a prayer for itself too, — 
that it many eventually enjoy real 
peace within it. 



YaMMEN WE received the 
if news of the Quezon 
ambuscade yesterday we were 
so stunned that as we read 
the dispatches from our cor- 
respondent in the province 
we couldn't believe it at first. 
As the hour dragged on and 
more dispatches flowed into 
the office, we still muttered 
to ourself: "It can't be 
true." 

* * * 

And as we sat down before our 
typewriter, we didn't even want to 
look at the column we'd prepared 
'earlier yesterday. We felt it to 
be out of line and out of time 
before this national tragedy and 
we knew we had to write another 
one. 




Mrs. Aurora Quezon was 
the mother of her" country. 
Wherever ihe guilt Tor 'her 
murder lie*, no IxboMs have 
ever dripped with; more inno- 
cent or nobler biobcT. 

The outraged A*&Q}>lo will 
not listen to any reason for 
this most heinous of all 
crimes. Tin y will not conci 
it. It is a crime that strikes 
nt the hearts of each and 
everyone of us. 

If, as General Kamos says, 
she was the victim of i>l*iu 
bandits then fcho guilt

Wc hardly knew the people 
who lost their lives in the ambush, 
except perhaps from what we've 
read from the papers. Yes, we 
had met the soft-spoken, grand 
lady Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon, quite 
a number of times at the Phil- 
ippine National Red Cross head- 
quarters at San Rafael street. We 
remember the many occasions 
where she helped us get stories. 
But we also know that Mrs. Que- 
zon was not only kind. She was 
one of the most accommodating 
public figures we ever met. We 
never knew her to turn down any 
sports promoter who needed her 
help. That was how unselfish she 
was. 

*- . . • # 

As* for her daughter, Baby, It 
was nothing more than seeing her 
from a distance. We used to see 
her every time there was an im- 
portant sports event at the Rizal 
Memorial stadium. We can't eva- 
luate properly, lest we do her in- 
justice, how much she encouraged 
our sports by lending her pre- 
sence, how she inspired some of 
our tennis stars. We will miss her 
cheers and her laughter. 

* * * 

We remember how Baby used 
to make a late entry into the sta- 
dium with her sister, &ini escort- 
ed by Philip Buencamino III. 
Everybody would look toward 
i their direction as they walked be- 
|hind the long: rows of seats to 
find their places amon? the 
crowd. And, of ten times, the play- 
ers felt grand that the Quczons 

were present. . 

* • t 

As for the late Quezon City Ma- 
yor Ponciano Bernardo, we knew 

1 how sports-minded he was, 
through some of our friends. The 
late Mayor Bernardo was largely 
responsible in promoting sports 

' in Quezon City. He took time out 
from his official duties to inau- 
gurate basketball courts and lea- 
gues and almost every sports- 
minded resident of the city look- 
ed up to him for support. 

* * * 

These are some of the people 
we lost in that ambuscade whose 
loss Philippine sports will mourn* 




Oh *1Ue (lecotd 



By H. Q. BORROMEO 



Now it is too late to mourn. It is too late to explain. The 
woman we revered so much and whom the people held so dear 
to their heart is dead. Explanations, promises of swift and im- 
placable justice, will not bring* her back to life. 

Hufcs or plain bandits, what difference does it make? The 
government cannot shirk its responsibility. It was mass murder 
in cold blood, made possible because of the failure of the govern- 
ment to restore peace and order despite assurances by its spokes- 
men that "it is now safe to travel in Central Luzon/' 

The- question we ask is why. Why did it have to be the innocent 
to sacrifice their lives and whose deaths could not possibly serve their 
murderers any good purpose? 

If the killers were Huks*, they might have had an understand- 
able reason for using violence. But violence employed against the 
innocent, against the widow of the man who had dedicated his own 
life to the same fundamental cause for which they now claim to 
light . . . that cannot be explained. If they must resort to violence, 
there arc so many we have in mind 021 whom it could have been 
used ro the lasting benefit of the country. 

If the killers were plain bandits, in search of loot, the less rea- 
son was fehere for such an orgy of bloodletting. The victims would 
have gladly allowed themselves to be stripped of everything of any 
value in exchange for their lives which could so easily have been 
spared. But killers maddened and driven to audacity by a sense 
of immunity from punishment derived from continued and so far 
succqs ance of duly constituted authority feel they can af 

ford to be merciless. How long they shall continue to defy the 
government, only the government alone can tell

Philip was such a nice, clean boy, friendly, warm-hearted and 
generous, so full of life and laughter, that I learned to love him. 
Of course he had his faults, but you- take your friends as they 
are, not as you would want them to be. And Philip, for all his 
faults, was quite a man. In all the years that we kept close to- 
gether, I never knew him to deliberately do a mean thing. 




Because he was by nature easy-going and « mM *J»Jff^ 
rated me at times by failing to take things more seriously and 
«si«o 7™ ■ considerable talents to point out the many evils ^if fnch 
our aov^nent is cursed. Actually, he was not wholly indifferent 
To then ? He could on occasions become quite angry over eertam 
iniustiZes but he had no capacity for sustained indignation, and 
U was Z't in him to fret and worry over the disgraceful and scan- 
dalous Jau this country is being run. Life to him was one swell 
adventure to \ e lived and savoured to the full, with very little 
ttZTleft for crusades. The world cannot be changed or saved in

Mr. Quirino has much to answer for. These are the wafces of 
impatient ambition, these are the wapres of his double-cross of the 
Huks, and his brutal policy of extermination. Daily, in Central 
Luzon, innocent men, women and children die. caught between those 
two contending knights in shining armour, the Huks on one side, 
and the PC and their civilian guard allies on the other. Thousands 
have already died, and many more will die in the days to come 
now that Mr. Ouirino, in an effort to ease his troubled conscience, 
insanelv cries all-out war. Whole barrios and poblaciones w ; ll again 
"be shelled and blown to bits, there will be savage retaliation, and 
the bloody butcher's list will grow long. It is ironic that a socially 
nrominent and beloved familv had to be wiped out before the whole 
nation woke up to the terrible and tragic fact that Filipinos are 
dying every day in bloody Central Luzon. 

hi the final analysis, it is Mr. Ouirino who is responsible for 
the death of Dova Aurora, Bator, Philip and nine others who were 
trapved in that Huh ambuscade. Because of Mr. Quirino they vent- 
to Baler. They vjent triistina his boastful assurance as President 
and C 'omm and \er-in -Chief of all the armed forces of the Philippine? 
that peace and order has been completely restored, and they met 
hheir death on the highway, riddled by bullets that were meant for 
Elpidio Quirino. 

The blame for this rests on tbe conscience of Elmdio Ouirino. 
T hope it rests there heavily. God damn him, and God damn the 
men who killed my friend! , «

Smrial to the Chronicle 

WASHINGTON', D.C. May 4 
- Mrs. Quezon's role in Philip, 
piue history was portrayed bv 
the Kev. Father Pacifico Ortiz 
who delivered the sermon at 
Hie requiem mass celebrated by 

[Archbishop O'Boyie in Washing- - 

how. 

Father Ortiz described the 
^murder of Mrs. Quezon as more 
tfcan the kiUin£ of an innocent 
person. "It is a dastardly at- 
tempt to kill the nation", he 
said, "for no nation can loii£ 
survive without love, without 
rharity, and if ever there was 
a person who in our gene- 
ration incarnated charity, iove, 
kindness, U was she — the sweet 
oin passionate lady whose me- 
mory binds us in prayer today". 

Fa: her Ortiz who was the spi- 
ritual adviser of the Quezons 
tec inpanied the family from Ma 
nila to Australia and th e Unit- ! 
ed .States. ''Behind the man 
we all admired", Father Ortiz 
continued, "stood the woman we 
all loved; behind the champion 
of social justice, stood the lady 
>• charity, who like a mother, 
•)r- us together; healed brok- 
en friendships; bound up poli- 
tical wounds, poured the oil of 
Jin passion on the social ulcers ! 
of our age, cherished and guar- 
ded the sanctities of our homes." 
Father Ortiz also paid tribute 1 
• Mrs. Quezon's daughter Maria I 
Aurora when he said, "Her ! 
feme will be uttered in bene, 
ilction". Concluding hi3 mov- 
ing sermon which caused many 
' *eep, Father Ortiz cited Pre- 
sident Quezon's tribute to Dona 
Aurora when he dedicated hi3 
book The Good Fight thus: "To 
py wife and children, whose 
oourage in the presence of the 
greatest dangers and whose de- 
votion to me and to the cause

PHILIPPINES FREE PRESS 



Ik Common Man Speaks Do the QUEZON Ira 



neoy 



• THOUGH it is now a week since the incredible murder of Mrs 
Aurora Quezon and 11 others by a band of Huks, people in Manila 
and the provinces continue to express deep sorrow as well as burning 
indignation. A cross-section of public feeling is disclosed in the fol- 
lowing informal comments of citizens. They are reported by Staff 
Member Ty who overheard them in restaurants, buses, stores and on 
the street. 



"The Quezon massacre happened 
because our officials are not thinking 
of the people, especially the common 
tao. They think only of themselves, 
of how to rebuild their houses, of 
how to increase their wealth and blind- 
fold the voters at election time. 1 ' 

★ ★ * 

"The Constabulary are not the only 
ones to blame. High government of- 
ficials should share the blame. They 
themselves are waging war against 
each other. If these officials who 
should be the first to uphold the se- 
curity and welfare of the people are 
committing grievous blunders, should 
the low-salaried Constabulary soldiers 
be blamed for doing likewise?" 

★ ★ ★ 

"The government is to blame. . .be- 
cause there would be no Huks and 
bandits if the people were contented." 

★ ★ ★ 

"The officials do not think of their 
countrymen. . .They think of nothing 
but their own good. So what do the 
poor people do? They turn to law- 
lessness." 

★ * ★ 



"Mrs. Quezon was a mother to the 
Filipinos. Why did the Huks kill her 
when she was always domg good?" 

★ ★ ★ 

"I used to sympathize with the 
Huks but after what they have done 
to our first First Lady, I hate them 
now. I'll even volunteer to fight with 
the Constabulary if my services will 
be needed " 

★ ★ ★ 

"The Huks are ex-guerrillas who 
had been fighting for our country and 
at last they were not able to get their 
recognition and their backpay. They 
were not recognized because some 
racketeering employees in the govern- 
ment fooled them and stole the mon- 
ey intended for these recognized guer- 
rillas." 

★ * ★ 

"Peace and order in our country are 
just words." 

★ ★ ★ 

"The only need now is to feed the 
Huks. Once they are fed, they won't 
commit any harm." 

★ * ★ 

"The government officials of Nue- 



va Ecija are to blame for the mas- 
sacre of our beloved Mrs. Quezon and 
others. The people of that province 
know that their place is full of Huks. 
Why didn't they send a note to Mrs. 
Quezon before her departure from 
Manila?" 

★ ★ ★ 

"Would I call our government a 
procrastinator? Who is ready to offend 
the Huks after so many people have 
been killed?" 

★ ★ ★ 

"We should capture the Huk lead- 
ers in order that nobody will lead 
them." 7 

★ ★ ★ 

"The death of our Mrs. Quezon re^ 
fleets the kind of government we have. 
The Huk problem will remain- un- 
solved. . . Our officials are interested 
in other things. They don't care be- 
cause they are not molested by the 
dissidents." 

★ ★ ★ 

"The government must stop all these 
expenditures for luxuries and pasikat 
(ostentation). Let us use more of 
our money to maintain peace and or- 
der. The lawlessness here is becom- 
ing worse." 

★ ★ ★ 

"I blame the President who has the 
power to execute military orders...." 

★ ★ ** 

"What does Taruc want? What do 
his followers want? Lands? If they 
want lands, why do they kill people? 
And why did they kill the chairman

The Cause 

Ralph Waldo Emerson has right- 
ly said that nothing is got for 
nothing; that the effect " is caused. 
The tragic death of Mrs. Aurora 
Aragon Quezon, which shocked the 
nation, is caused. What is the 
cause? What brought about the 
effects? 

The answer to the thought pro- 
voking question is in the words of 
Senator Geronima T. Pecson who 
?aid- "Grieving was not enough ior 
there- must be something of greater 
import that must be looked into. 
Why was she allowed to the danger 
^ea withcJt assuring her safety? 
There was dereliction of duty some- 
where and it must be localized."

OurGreatestTeacher 

These words and this our deep 
grief are hopelessly futile and 
inadequate to express the great 
loss that we have suffered from 
Dona Aurora's tragic death. 
She was our ideal Filipina 
mother, the personification of 
everything that was sublime 
and noble in Filipino woman- 
hood. Her devotion to her fa- 
mily, her solicitude over the 
poor, her indefatigable efforts 
at social amelioration, her 
exemplary self-effacement, the 
soothing influence of her ra- 
diant and pleasing personal- 
ity, — all of these qualities will 
forever enshrine her in our 
hearts. The death of Mrs. Que- 
zon and Baby Quezon completes 
the martyrdom of the Quezons 
for the cause of the masses. It 
is for us the living to emulate 
Dona Aurora's glorious exam- 
ple, for her life truly made her 
the greatest teacher of us all!

IRREPARABLE LOSS 

Dear Editor: 

If President Quirino, in 
the words of Justice Recto, 
did not stop being president 
in order to be the politician, 
we may still have the loved 
figure of Dona Aurora 
around us, the best symbol 
of Filipino womanhood. 

If President Quirino re- 
presented the peace and or- 
der situation as it should 
have been represented, in 
terms of security to the com- 
mon tao, however lowly he 
may be, and not in terms of 
public votes, the irreparable 
sacrifice of precious blood 
may not have been so bra- 
zenly exacted. 

PEDRO SALINAS 
Bureau of Post, Manila 



Dona AURORA A. DE QUEZON 

"Pure and spotless must the vic- 
tim be that the sacrifice may bp 
acceptable." These words of Jose 
Rizal, naturally come to our minds 
in this hour of our national be- 
reavement. For Dona Aurora, a 
victim of our fratricidal .hatred:-, is 
indeed a pure and spotless martyr. 

Divine Providence, has willed to 
demand from our country the moBl 
precious life of our citizenry. Let 
us hope and pray, that this our 
great loss will serve the great pur- 
pose of opening the eyes and touch- 
ing the hearts of all our nationals, 
that this fratricidal strife may ))<•■ 
put. to an end. 

Dona Aurora, will be remembei 
ed by many noble deeds, bm 1. like 
rn believe that our posterity will 
consider that her appeal to the na- 
tion, t'hrough the Catholic Hierar- 
chy, for a month of May dedicated 
to our Lady Mediatrix of all Gj 
hollowed with prayers and penan- 
ces, is her spiritual testament to 
her beloved country, and as such 
the most significant of her good 
deeds. 

With the sacrifice of her life in 
the altar of her country, her ap- 
peal acquired a very poignant 
meaning. She Had to die a m 
of our fratricidal strifes, for us to 
realize that we are facing a. great 
national crisis, which demands 
from all of us, more prayers, mor* 
penances, and a new way of life, if 
this our beloved country of ours 
is to be saved.

MRS. QUEZON, 'BABY/ 

NINE OTHERS 
|DIE IN HUK AMBUSH 

Victims Brought 
Here For Burial 



Outlaws Attack Party On Peaceful 
Mission, Rob Bodies; Casualties 
Include QC Mayor, Other Officials 

The remains of Mrs. Aurora Aragon de Quezon, her daughter 
f^T-^ , and nin ° ° ther victims of a Huk ambuscade 
RtiSSrl ^° 1Ja r S t Grd * y Were brought to Manila la st night in a 
funeral motorcade for interment in Manila as the nation slowlv 
recovered from the shock of the first report on the ambush 

Mrs. Quezon and her daugh.ter and members of her party were 
Killed on the Bongabon-Baler interprovincial road at 11*30 a m 
yesterday by a strong band of well armed Hukbalahaps. They were 
slain after the cars in Mrs. Quezon's motorcade had stopped and had 
identified the party as that of Mrs. Quezon. Then the bandits strip- 
ped the bodies of jewels and valuables. 

The widow of President Quezon met tragic death with loved 
ones and friends as she led a party of about 50 relatives and asso- 
ciates on a motor trip to Baler, Quezon, her hometown, to unveil the 
historical marker on the birthplace of President Quezon and to attend 
the town fiesta and the inauguration of the Baler hospital. 

The party was approaching Villa Aurora, still on Nueva Ecija 
soil, and was passing through a zig-zag road on hilly terrain when 
the leading cars were subjected to heavy enfilading fire. 

Quezon City Mayor Ponciano Bernardo, who was in the leading 
car with Mrs. Quezon, Baby Quezon, Maj. Gen. Rafael Jalandoni, 
Philip Buencamino III and Antonio San Agustin, left the car with 
his hands up in token of surrender and shouted: "This is Mrs.

As all cars screeched to a stop, men swarmed around the leading 
car. When Gen. Jalandoni saw the outlaws, he grabbed a .45 caliber 
automatic pistol and was cocking it when an outlaw struck him on 
the cheek with the butt of a rifle. As he dropped to the floor of the 
car, he heard volleys fired into its occupants.

Upon being mrormed of the trag-' 
edy, the President took the fol- 
lowing measures: 

1 He ordered former Speaker 
Jose Yulo to serve as his personal 
representative and 
with Secretary of &bmo 
Padilla, Executive Secretary Teo- 
doro Evangelista and Secretary ot 
National Defense Ruperto Kang- 
leon to make immediate arrange- 
ments for the temporary custody 
of the remains of the victims. 
.This would indicate that the Pres- 
ident will formulate more fitting 
arrangements for the dead. 

2 The President called upon 
General Mariano Castaneda and 
General Alberto Ramos to summer 
all the available forces for a full- 
dress campaign to eliminate tne 
bandits in the Nueva Ecija area. 

3. At the same time the Pres- 
ident ordered Secretary Evange- 
lista to mobilize all possible assist- 
ance to the wounded. 

The President was said to have 
• expressed the belief that the as- 
sailants were not Huks. The 
President reportedly said he could 
not believe that Huks meant to 
do any harm to Mrs. Quezon be- 
cause she was loved even by them. 

First official reports from Gen- 
eral Jalandoni received in Mala- 
canan said that the ambuscade 
occurred between 10 and 11 yes- 
terday moming beyond the Que- 
zon boundary about 60 kilometers 
from Bongabon, Nueva Ecija. 

According to a wire from Gen- 
eral Jalandoni, the "highway rob- \ 
bers had all gone after they have 
looted us." 

Acting on the orders of the Pres- j 
ident, Secretary Evangelista mob- 
ilized the Red Cross and the Phil- 
inpine Air Force to fly blood plas- 
ma and other medical supplies to 
Cabanatuan in an army plane. 

At the same time arrangements j 
were made to convey blood sup-j 
ply from Clark Field by a U.S. hel- j 
icopter to Cabanatuan after thej 
U.S. army authorities had volun- 
teered to assist. 

It was understood Mrs. Quezon 
decided to motor to Baler because 
she had been advised not to make 
plane trips. ' 

In deference to the wishes ot the 
surviving members of the Quezon 
family, interment of Mrs. Quezon, 
Baby Quezon and Philip Buenca- 
mino will be this afternoon at four 
j o'clock. The funeral procession 
will start from the University of 
Santo Tomas chapel to which the 
bodies were taken last night. 

Arrangements for the funeral of 
Mrs. Quezon were made by a com- 
mittee created on direction of 
President Quirino, composed of 
former Speaker Jose Yulo, chair- 
man; Dr. Manuel Lim (Red 
Cross), vice chairman; and Miss 
Manuela Gay (Catholic Women's 
League), Mrs. Francisca T. Beni- 
tez (Civic organizations), Secreta- 
ry of Labor Primitivo Lovina (cab- 
inet), Delfin Buencamino (govern- 
ment corporations), Senator Lo- 
renzo Tafiada (senate), Congress- 
man Tomas Morato (congress), 
Mayor Manuel de la Fuente (Ma- 
nila), Aurelio Intertas (labor), Fe- 
iip e Buencamino, Jr. (family), 
Z Mrs. Trinidad F. Legarda (Nation- 
al Federation- of Women's Clubs), 



Maj. Gen. Mariano N. Castaneda 
(armed forces), Dr. Antonio G. Si- 
son and Minister Ramon Fernan- 
dez, members. 

This committee will meet at 8 
a. ml today at the council of state 
room, Malacanan, to make ar- 
rangements on the vigils and the 
funeral details. 

The VSAC, YLAC and Girl 
Scouts of the Philippines will take 
charge of, the vigil and funeral ar- 
rangements for Baby Quezon. The 
Ateneo Alumni Association, Mala- 
canan Press Association and the 
"department of foreign affairs will 
be in charge of the vigil and fune- 
ral arrangements for Philip Buen- 
camino III. 

From 6 a. m. today there will be 
masses at the University of San- 
to Tomas chapel, the final mass to 
be at 9 or 9:30 a. m. when the 
President will be in attendance. 
Bishop Rufino Santos, of Manila, 
wil l say the last mas s and will 

give the last blessing at the ceme- 
tery during interment. 

By JOVITO REYES

CABANATUAN, Nueva Ecija, 
April 28. — Mrs. Quezon, widow of 
the late President Quezon, and 10 
others, including her daughter, 
Baby* and son-in-law, Philip 
! Buencamino III, were lulled when 
they were ambushed by a band of 
no less than 100 armed Hukbala- 
haps at 10:30 o'clock this morning 
bear the boundary of Nueva Eci-: 
ja, and Quezon provinces, about ■ 
62 kilometers east of Bongabong. 

General Jalandoni is the lone j 
survivor in the car of Mrs. Que- 
zon. He related that when the 
, ambushers came near the car he 
1 was given up for aead a}so be- 
cause he was buried under the 
bodies of the Quezons, Mayor 
Bernardo and Tony San Agustm. 
He said he regained consciousness 
when the PC troops led by Ma- 
jor Burgosino Fausto started iir- , 
ing at the outlaws who then re- 
treated in disorderly fashion to- 
wards the Sierra Madre moun- 1 
tains. 

A strong PC reinforcement 
from Cabanatuan and Bongabong 
joined by a strong PA force pur- 
Isued the fleeing dissidents, ac- 
cording to the survivors. The 
fighting was still going on one 
survivor said, when they left the 
scene of the ambush. He said he 
believed that the Huks also sus- 
tained heavy casualties. 

Mrs. Quezon and her party were 
reportedly on their way to Baler, 
Quezon, to attend the town fiesta 
there and at the same time to 
witness the inauguration of the 
Baler hospital. > 

Immediately upon reaching Que- 
zon soil, the party was fired upon 
by the Huks who were -strate- 
gically deployed on the hig_ h em- 
bankments of the zigzag road near 
Villa Aurora. The dissidents con- 
centrated their attack on the 
ffrst car in which were riding Mrs. 
Quezon, Baby Quezon, Buenca- 
mino, Tony San Agustm, Gen. Ja- 
tandoni and Mayor Bernardo 
TOnking that all the occupants 
had been killed, the outlaws aimed 
their shots at the succeeding jeeps 
bearing the other members of the 




GEN. K. JALANDONI 



Quezon party. About 20 other 
cars which composed the long mo- 
torcade returned towards Bonga- 
bon upon hearing the shots. 

Occupants of the two other ve- 
hicles who escaped unhurt were 
Hilarion Silayan, director of the 
PACSA, Dr. Francisco Vicuna, 
chief of the Quezon Memorial hos- 
pital; Dr. Eduardo Quisumbing 
and several others. 

Reports of this incident created 
a stir here. Some informed 
sources blamed the present Liberal 
party squabbles in the Senate for 
having failed to give due atten- 
tion to the worsening condition in 
Central Luzon, especially in Nueva 
Ecija. . 

Governor Juan O. Chioco who 
rushed to the scene of the am- 
bush with Provincial Board Mem- 
ber Sixto Ilustre wired the Pres- 
ident and the secretary of the in- 
: terior about the incident. 
! Meanwhile the news of the bru- 
!tal killings spread like wildfire 
throughout the province. PC 
' troops had a difficult time keep- 
ing thousands of people from 
crowding at the provincial hos- 
pital as they clamored to have 
a glimpse of the body of Mrs. Que- 
zon and her daughter. Dr. Ray- 
mundo Bernardo, brother of the 
slain mayor of Quezon City, was 
speechless. 

Philip Buencamino HI died at 
the provincial hospital before he 
could be taken to Manila by plane 
for treatment of his wounds. All 
the victims were taken to Manila 
, late today as government forces 
intensified their pursuit of the 
Huks responsible for the ambush. 

Those who were able to escape 
to Bongabon said that almost the 
entire force of the 1st combat 
team, headed by Capt. Dominador 
Alo rushed to the scene of the 
ambush. Lt. Col. Angel Magalla- 
nes, newly appointed provincial 
commander for Nueva Ecija, who 
was having a conference with pro- 
vincial officials this morning im- 
I mediately left for an undisclosed 
place upon learning of the Huk 

r attack. ''■ ra

On Her Last Trip

m Going To My 
Home/ She Said 

By PACIENCIA TORRE-GUZMAN J 

In Baguio, last Friday, I talked 
with Mrs. Aurora Aragon Quezon. 

It was siesta time when I barg- 
ed in at the Quezon home on Le- 
garda street. She was wearing a 
navy wool dress and all smiles 
when she came out on the terrace 
to find my photographers already 
in possession of the place. She 
crinkled her eyes at me in good- 
natured response when I told her 
I was lucky to be able to feature 
her Baguio home in an Evening 
News article. 

I recall now that almost her 
very first words to me were, "I 
am going down tomorrow because! 
I am going to my home town." 

She ushered me and my two! 
Photographers to the living room. | 
She lifted a vase here, an ash tray 
there, moved a floor lamp hearer 
to the piano — she was all help, 
despite her daughter Nini's fears I 
that she was unnecessarily strain- i 
ing herself. 

She took me to an v.il painting 
in the dining room. Mrs. Quezon, 
pointed to me painstakingly how 
every known Philippine fruit was 
included in the painting . This 
was presented, she said, to the late j 
President Quezon by Dr. Eduardo ! 
Quisumbing, one of those in the ! 
tragic party, on the President's 
birthday on August 19, 1941, just 
bef or ; the outbreak of the Pacific 
war. 

What she relished narrating 
about the painting was how it is 
the only reminder left of their fa- 
mous Pasay home which burned 
down during liberation. The paint- 
ing, Mrs. Quezon said, was snatch- 
ed by a Swiss gentleman from the 
burning house, and carefully roll- 
ed in a bamboo tube which the 
nice gentleman carried with him 
to Switzerland to restore later to 
Mrs. Quezon. 

The painting is very dear to 
Mrs. Quezon. She would gaze at 
it from afar and leaf over precious 
memories from a happy past. 

We remarked at the soothing at- 
mosphere of permanency even in 
this vacation home, at which she 
again crinkled her eyes and smil- 
ed serenely as if to say, "That's 
has always been my pattern of life 
—-permanency, stability in any- 
thing I do." 



A ) ill collector ^ame, whom she 
attended to with dispatch, saying, 
"I alv ays pay my bills in Manila, 
but if you say so, I'll pay you now." 
Whicn she did. 

A service tray borne by a maid 
passed by on the way to Baby's 
room where Lulu Reyes was be- 
ing entertained for lack of room 
space in the living and dining 
rooms which were for the moment 
in complete possession of the pho- 1 
tographers. Nonong came out ana 
Wanted to know if Dona Aurora 
was *:ot going along with him to 
attend Benediction. Nonong saun- 
tered out, and Mrs. Quezon took 
me to her bedroom to show me 
proudly her new altar with its 
new reigning image, the Lady of 
Fatima. 

Her room was a mess, she was 
packing up for this fatal trip. 
Again she said: "I am leaving 
tomorrow, I have to visit my home 
town. This she said with much 
happy anticipation I understood. 
I knew what it meant going back 
to the old homestead. 

She pushed aside her shoes 
which were lined in a row prepa- 
ratory to going into shoe cases. She 
steered away her grandson's crib 
to gi/e room to the photographers. 
"My grandson rooms with me," 
she remarked. It was then I saw 
for the second Mme that after- 
noon the framed snapshot of 
grandmother and grandson in 
close filial^ communion resting on 
her dresser. The camera froze 
the two just as the grandmother- 
ly kiss was being firmly planted 
on the chubby cheeks of gurgling, 
impish. 15-month old "Pongoy" 
(as Mini teasingly calls her first- 
fa om.» 

Easier in the afternoon, Nini 
and her husband Philip showed 
me this photograph while we were: 
watching the photographers get 
busy on the terrace. 

It is a photograph the whole fa- 
mily is proud of. It is a portrait 
of a golden life lived as the Lord 
commands. To me, that photo- 
graph best symbolizes the close- 
knit f amily life Mrs. Quezon had 
consistently maintained from the 
early years, through an unmatch- 
ed national career as wife of a 
people's leader through the eter- 
nity of bereavement and on to the 
seren* days when ner grandchild- 
ren were beginning to come to 
give her joy in old age. 

Mrs. Quezon took off some two 
hours from her packing to attend 
to us. We apologized. And to our 
"feliz viaje" she again crinkled 
her eves and smiled the gracious 
smile we all knew.

a.m. High requiem mass was 
sung at 9:30 by Msgr. Rufino 
Santos, bishop of Manila. 

From the UST chapel to the 
main gate of the UST campus

composed of Justice Jose Yulo 
chairman; Dr. Manuel Lim, 
vice-chairman, and Sec. Primi- 
tivo Lovina, Senator Lorenzo M.

zon boulevard, Azcarraga, Rizal

Mrs. Quezon 
Laid To Rest 

Under an overcast sky yes- 
terday afternoon, a mourning 
nation buried the most revered 
woman in the country, her 
daughter, and her son-in-law — 
innocent victims of a brutal Huk 
ambuscade. 

The remains of the three, 
Mrs. Aurora Quezon, Baby Que- 
zon, and Philip Buencamino III, 
were laid in final rest at the 
Quezon family lot in the North 
Cemetery where the late Pres- 
ident Manuel L. Quezon Is en- 
tombed. 

As early as 2 o'clock in the 
afternoon, crowds began gather- 
ing- on the UST grounds, lining 
the streets through which the 
funeral cortege was to pass. At 
4 o'clock, President Elpidio Qui- 
rino, his daughter Vicky, and 
aides-de-camp arrived at the 
UST chapel. The President was 
the principal pall bearer for 
Mrs. Quezon. 

The cortege left the chapel 
at 4:30 o'clock arriving at the 
cemetery at 6 o'clock. Police 
and PC soldiers had difficulty 
at the burial lot clearing the 
way for the procession. 

A hush, broken only by stifled 
sobs, suddenly fell a s the pall 
bearers approached with the 
caskets, to the strains of "Near- 
er My God to Thee," played by 
the constabulary band. 

The caskets were laid down 
a few feet from the burial lot, 
Mrs. Quezon's, draped in a 
Filipino flag; Baby's, borne by 
members of the YLAC — the cha- 
rity organization of which she 
was the president; Philip's, car- 
ried by his father, sisters, and 
relatives. After the blessing, gi- 
ven by Bishop Rufino Santos of 
Manila, Mrs. Quezon's caslcet 
was lifted and laid into the 
niche, still wet, beside her hus- 
band's. Baby followed next, 
banked with flowers, her tearful 
friends her pall bearers. Phi- 
Hp was last, his tomb and Ba- 
by's side by side. 

The crowd dispersed silently 
at 6:20, a few remaining tot 
break off sprigs from the bloom- 1 
lDg shrubs on the burial lot for 
mementos. 




WHILK she lived, Mrs. Aurora Quezon was active in social work. She had identified herself with the Philippine National Red Cross as chairman of 

many &uid raising campaigns.

Yes, you are Viernes. You are a 
little god with a great big gun 
on your hip. Originally you had 
a Cause with- which few of us, 
considering ourselves decent, had 
quarrel; but you have grown big- 
ger than your cause and now you 
are Viernes and you boast of wo- 
man-killing. Off and on there is 
drivel that "it was not the Huks." 
No, it very likely was not the Huks 
as an organization, but eei tainly 
it was some of the Huks in an or- 
ganization running amuck for lack 
of leadership control. Definitely 
it was Viernes, so proudly claim- 
ing credit for his armed prowess... 

Down here in the lethargic low- 
lands, Viernes, there is a moral 
and mental evasiveness which 
avers we didn't do it, you didn't 
do it. "they" did it. . . '-they" 
indicating the imaginary margin 
for banditry. Thus we play pol- 
itics with the devil. Thus we 
avoid saying anything nasty about 
the likes of you lest we ourselves 
get a bullet in the back. The word 
for this, of course, is cowardice, 
the language not having changed 
since the days the guerrillas scout- 
ed for and held the camps you 
now use. But a people can become 
only so afraid, Viernes, then no 
more; once the saturation point 
Is reached, you will still be Vier- 
nes, yes, but the people will be 
The Teople. 

Though we of small stature 
cannot answer for a nation, each 
Luman, " JjlJ] nu1iMTft»n f ~ hlim<L 



can answer Cor himself, and by 
that token I for me. You acclaim 
yourself one of the "little people" 
— the exploited tenant, the under- 
paid laborer, the nameless men_ 
and women in millions as against 
the unjustly favored few. As one 
of the "little people," you have 
spoken with blind and final hai- 
red in the merciless murder of 
Mother Quezon, Baby, Philip, Ber- 
nardo, the others I may not have 
known personally but whose lives 
were equally precious. Nor have 
their numan rights been more 
savagely denied, than the .ives 
nf tnen, women and children slain 
in hloodv continuity through four 
years of pretended peace. 

Think you. Viernes, that all the 
"little people" are you ? How aboul 
me. and the millions like me? We 
have known labor in the fields, 
dishwashing in restaurants, tlu 
picking and packing of fruit. Wj 
are the little people, too, come 
earlier to maturity perhaps tlu 
you. Perhaps our fight for the 
same things is longer and harder 
but, God give in strength to kp< j p 
it so, cleaner. We reason with 
ideas, not with bullets. Bullets 
are for defense against aggres- 
sors, not for our brothers, not 
for the few truly noble in an ad-

he would turn tins onr 
country upside down to «

needed the death of Mother Que- 
zon to pinpoint the raging ol a 
,,vil war. Anybody's violent ana 
unmerited' death would have suf- 
ficed. 

Who first fought for boeial 
Justice? Who went to you un- 
der the burning Pampanga sun, 
through the Munoz floods, to the 
farthest outposts to see you. hear 
von help vou? Who had long 
conferences with that other great 
man, Pedro Abad Santos, and for 
hours stood before a hundred 
thousand of you at a time in sim- 
ple, honest debate? It was neither 
politics nor patience; it was for 
love of you. 

He knew about the creek dam- 
med by a rich man to make a 
fishpond at the expense of living 
■vater for hundreds of your fa- 
milies along the dried water- 
way... He knew about the caci- 
que's usurious wife and the 10- 
centavo bottle of mercurochrome 
she debitted against you for P2.- 
00. He knew how insufficient 
vour share of the crops and, too, 
how barren the earth for so many 
mouths. . . I know he knew, for 
he allowed me to study reports 
meant only for him and his Ca- 
binet and to study them only un- • 
der Vargas' watchful eye lest I 
make off with one he would him- 
self study further: many times 1 
studied until 11 o'clock or mid- 
night in Vargas' Malacanan of- 
fice. And who was I? — just a 
(>\\b reporter, for a long time with 
more of a haircut than a name, 
yet even 1 could ask this great 
man questions, even 1 could 
quench the thirst for knowledge 
with a President's secretary my 
librarian. 

None of us was too humble for 
his attention, neither you nor I. 
As he helped an ignorant, eager 
girl, so did he valiantly help you. 
He knew that what you wanted, 
the familiar but barren land un- 
der your feet, was at best an emp- 
ty heritage, so he pointed you 
to. new land, to virgin land, and 
he loaned you the money to go, 
gave you NLS^T supervision, fo- 
cused national interest on you. 
Do you think the landlords were 
happy to have him ease you out 
ot your bondage? He stood strong 
and alone in his humanity, and 
for this vou slew his family. 
Your own revered Pedro Abad 
Santos would cry out against your 
savagery. Wherever the gentle 
old bachelor lies in his hero's 
grave surely his heart must ache 
for his political children who have 
become what? 

All through a great President's 
years of service, Mother Quezon 
helped her husband and in that 
capacity was our first, and last, 
l^ady of the Land. Wherever 
there were those in service to 
■ ountry, she was there, not in self- 
glorification but in assistance to 
him and to them... among the 
teachers, the nurses, the writers, 
ie welfare, workers, the lawv

is dead and cannot herself ask. in 
what way did Baby harm you? — 
by blasting public indifference to- 
ward the lepers' misery? sweat- 
ing for funds for the Ylac slum 
schools? cramming law into her 
head, the better to carry on her 
father's work? a fragile body, 
driven by an untiring spirit? 
Baby's sharp tongue and cutting 
wit were only for us i n u r- 
ed to it, understanding and lov- 
ing her for it. Never did she jab 
at you, to whom she was fiercely 
loyal, rt is even possible that she 
was a friend to me because she 
considered me one of you. 'Hi.'* 
she would say, /'How's Yay the 
Underprivileged? Madrigal still 
overworking and underfeeding 
you?" And if I mourned my fi- 
nancial state, she would jibe, 
Don't be stupid! Strike!"' 
Though the years, I was grate- 
ful for her frankness, for her 
rough, unpitying, challenging 
friendship, for her equality and 
because once, when we quarrelled, 
and she stamped her foot and 1 
^talked out in anger, when I 
reached the office she was on the 
telephone to apologize. . . 

Philip, too, is dead. What dra- 
matic irony that you butchered 
him. For Philip and Baby were 
your open door to a half-million 
hectares of free, virgin land... 
Only one other person knows what 
Baby and Philip knew - that 



there was a place for you to go. 
land for you, a new start. Tha; 
person is Judge Barrera. He 
knows. A.sk him. 

It started in the time of Pres- 
ident Roxas, the time when peo- 
ple, despite atrocities, gave you 
rhe benefit of the doubt. They 
could not see what Etoxaa saw 
then, that the language you un 
derstand is the language of vio- 
lence. They had no quarrel with 
your cause, and only a doubt as 
to your methods. Fatuously they 
thought that secretly siphoning 
von out of congested areas, spirit- 
ing you away under the noses oi 
the soldiers, leaving them with 
nothing to fight and thereby sav- 
ing their lives too, would rescuse 
vou from the circumstances of in- 
justice and hunger which justi- 
fied your desperate rebellion 

It was so agreed. Baby and 
Philip would let you know if and 
when... I would point where. All 
your problemms were being con- 
sidered — food, tools, instruction, 
tree medicine, schools, markets for 
vour produce, immunity from the 
past. . . 

It is your friends you have 
killed, your friends more than 
mine, more than anybody's. You 
snatched a necklace, and lost a 
loving heart. You tore a jewel 
from the one ear in the Philip- 
pines that would still listen to 
vou. You poured bullets into frail 
Baby at the dawn of a legal career 
for the underprivileged. You 
oiowed down a man who. ailed, 
out to you, not for himself but 
those who defended you where 
you could not defend yourselves ^ 
There is little loss in hating you: * 
you cannot do worse to your pne- Q 
mies than you have done to yourja 
friends.

Aurora Aragon Quezon 

By VICENTE V1LLAMIN 



I 

I 




WASHINGTON (By Air Mail) 
— The tragic end of Mrs.. Aurora 
Aragon Quezon and members of 
her family is truly a matter of 
universal sorrow. Beloved and 
respected by all because of her 
own goodself and 
being the widow 
of the late la- 
mented President 
Manuel Quezon, 
even those who 
perp'et rated the 
dastardly murder 
must be sorrow- 
] ing now as they 
realize their fa- 
tal error in mis- 1 
identifying their ■ 
victims, for sure- V. VILLAMIN 
ly Mrs. Quezon 
had not done anything #to them 
or to others of the common people 
except what would be helpful and 
advantageous to them. 

Mortal life is such a fleeting 
episode and so full of ; uncertain- 
ties that while life lasts it were 
better to be happy by leading 
useful and satisfying life that 
vould earn the approbation of 
*od and of mankind. Mrs. 'Que- 
zon lived such a life and there- 
fore she should be held up as a 
model for other women to emu- 
| late. 

I have met Mrs. Quezon in 
many different cities, but it was 
in Los Angeles where I had long 
conversations with her. She en- 
joyed the charms and pleasant- 
ness of southern California in 
company with her three children. 
She occupied the house of her 
friend, Mrs. Pilar Hidalgo Lim, 
who, like her, is an outstanding 
leader of the Filipino people. 

Mrs. Quezon told me of her dif- 
ferent activities in which she put 
her heart and soul. She con- 
cerned herself with the welfare 
cf the masses. Her ideas on pub- 
lic questions affecting them were 
simple and practical and showed 
a mind that was analytical. I men- 
tioned her efforts to increase the 
yield per hectare of rice on her 
farm in a talk I made to the fin- 
ance committee of the United 
States Senate when it had under 
consideration the Philippine trade 
act of 1946. I was honoring her 
as a person with sound and prac- 
tical ideas. 

; By the press, I followed her 



to Manila from the United States. 
She was a potent 'force in the na- 
tion, a dynamo of work, an angel 
of mercy, a faithful servitor of 
humanity and withal a mirror of 
natural modesty and democratic 
simplicity. Her memory will be 
cherished by the Filipino people 
from generation to generation. 

Her husband, the late first pres- 
ident of the Philippine Common- 
wealth, was a great and dynamic 
leader. By his genius and com- 
pelling personality he kept the 
government on an even keel and 
held the people together, galvaniz- 
ing and vitalizing their spirit of 
nationalism. Husband and wife, in 
separate fields of endeavor, 
formed a working team that func- 
tioned incessantly for the well-be- 
ing of the Philippines. 

The country has yet many 
anxious days to face. The bru- 
talizing effects of war on some 
jfeople are still untamed and un- 
diminished. A spirit of restless- 
ness is still stirring in the minds 
of the masses. To bring them 
back to normal is the first duty 
of government. Mrs. Quezon was 
helping powerfully in that task 
as a private citizen. The mur- 
derers got the wrong person when 
they slew her. 

The murderous incident is an at- 
tack against both the people and 
the government. And both of 
them must close ranks to repel 
further attacks. The President 
of the nation must be solidly sup- 
ported to maintain law and order 
and to uphold the dignity of the 
government. Every erring soul 
must be overwhelmingly convinced { 
that every act of lawlessness and J 
bestiality will be discovered and 
dealt with relentlessly. 

Mrs. Quezon's fate should 
serve as a unifying force among 1 
the good people of the Philippines, I 
irrespective of personal political 
differences and party affiliations. 
It should also serve to sear the 
soul of those few who believe in 
violence and cover the things that 
belong to others without earning 
them. 

Aurora Aragon Quezon, with 
members of her family and others, 
has departed from this earth. If 
every act of service and humanity 
that she rendered to others in 
her lifetime is represented by a 
beautiful rose, there will certain- 
ly be a mountain of beautiful roses

Pays Tribute To Mrs. Quezon 



While "everyone feels the poorer 
because of her death," yet "our 
people and our prosperity will be 
the richer because she has lived," 
President Quirino said in his nec- 
rological speech during the memo- 
rial services in honor of Dona Au- 
rora A. Quezon given by the Phil- 
ippines National Red Cross at Ma- 
lacanan last night. 

Former Associate Justice Manuel 
Lim was another speaker at the 
gathering that was well attended. 
The President said in part: 
"Mrs. Quezon, devoted and at- 
tached to her husband as she had 
always been all her life, human 
enough to feel the immeasurable 
loss for her beloved husband's 
demise, summoned all the courage 
and wisdom that she could muster 
from her heritage and determined 
to continue her husband's life 
struggles while she lived. It was 
she who had served as the lever 
that had gauged the course of her 
husband's public life. She had sta- 
bilized and steadied his movements 
and convictions as he had embark- 
ed upon his aggressive and com- 
pelling patriotic endeavors at the 
height of his strength, power and 
influence as leader of hispeople. 
The husband's vicissitudes of for- 



prayers. Quezon, the great man 
and leader, became the greater be- 
cause of the inspiring influence 
of Mrs. Quezon, the woman and 
wife. And Mrs. Quezon eventually 
became the rock of refuge and of 
strength to many a Filipino lead- 
er beset with the burden of the 
people's problems. That she did 
all this quietly jjatfrin the private, 
sanctuary of the home is a grate- 
ful fact and commentary on the 
womanhood of this country. 

"Aurora Aragon Quezon was not 
only the first of the First Ladies 
of the land. In her own right, she 
was simply grand ! The insuperable 
dignity, wisdom and £7-ace with, 
which she carried her responsibi- 
lity to the nation after the death 
of President Quezon were no ac- 
cident; they came as the nature 
flowering of a lifetime of respon- 
sible, devoted and fulfilled com- 
radeship. When she undertook to 
head our National Red Cross, she 
simply acceded to giving formal 
confirmation, on her own right, of 
being in fact and in truth, mother 
to her people. She did not merely 
lend her name, great as it was, 
to the cause. She labored mightily, 
doing yeoman service like every- 



l civic activities since she returned symbolizing her public life.

had made him turn his eyes upon (Provided its deepest, most abiding 
the lot of the common man. But inspiration. Our people may not 
it was she who had touched and know now who was the greater, 
softened his heart and made him ' Quezon the Father of his country, 




champion the cause of the masses, 
the underprivileged, the underfed. 
President Quezon s social justices 
had been Aurora Quezon's inspira- 
tion and passion. 

"But great as her influence had 
been, she had never abused it to 
further a justifiable personal pride 
when she knew that grave pro- 
blems of state were involved. She 
had asked nothing for herself. She 
had never - suggested that she 
would be sharing the criticism or 
glorification of her husband's con- 
duct even if it affected her feel- 
ings or dignity as the mother of his 
children. Nor had she minded be- 
ing dragged along up or down as 
her husband's career had brought 
him higher or lower in the nation- 
al estimation. She had always 
risen to the occasion in the most 
helpful spirit. Because far and 
above her realization of some of 
her husband's failings in his hu- 
man adventures, she had had ab- 
solute confidence in her husband's 
devotion and respect for her 
which she undoubtedly had in- 
spired by her conduct and her 



or Aurora Aragon Quezon, the tru. 
ly symbolic mother of her race. 
But history will record them both 
as the greatest benefactors of this 
generation, and Mrs. Quezon an 
the greatest woman in her coun- 
try. 

"The world has shared our peo- 
ple's sorrow in her tragic passing. 
Those of us who knew her well can 
most truly say: to know her was 
to respect her, to admire her, to 
love her. No longer shall she grace 
the halls of the land which were 
wont to be exalted by her en- 
nobling personality; no longer 
shall welfare institutions feel the 
touch of her kind heart and hand. 
No longer shall these Palace halls 
be dignified by her handsome and 
queenly figure; no longer shall 
these walls receive the impact of 
her gentle influence. No longer 
shall this atmosphere, which for 
many years she had enlivened with 
her wisdom and charm, be per- 
meated by her spirit of racial 
honor and pride — as embodiment 
of the noblest type of Filipino 
womanhood."

Quezon children, related that Mrs. 3 
Quezon spent the day with her last 
Monday, and told her to look after

I Baby spent the day with her 
Tuesday and was in' hi^h spirit . 
I One of those who would have also 
joined the party was Mrs. Quezon's^

It wa3 learned here that the 
visit of Dona Aurora to Baler 
was known here one week in 
advance as workers of the bu-

All the three death vehicles 
were left at the scene of the

bullets. 

Governor Chio'co was deeply

Como Quezon 
Dona Aurora 



Da. Aurora Quezon fue quien 
conmovio y ablando el corazon 
de su esposo el Presidente Que- 
zon, e impulso a este a luchar 
por la causa de las masas, y los 
desheredados de la fortuna, segun 

declaro el Presidente Quirino en 
la oracion funebre, que pronun- 
cio anoche en Malacanan, en la 
velada necrologica celebrada por 
Da. Aurora, bajo los auspicios de 
la Cruz Roja Nacional Filipina. 



lada fueron el presidente interi- 
no de la Cruz Roja Manuel Lim, 
iy Da. Trinidad F. Legarda, pre- 
sidenta de la Federacion Nacional 
de Clubs de Mujeres de Filipi- 
nas. El Dr. Victor Buencamiw* 
se encargo del discurso de agra- 
decimiento.- 

En su discurso el Presidente 
dijo: 



Otros que hablaron en la ve- 



"La Sra. de Quezon, devota y 
apegada a su esposo, lo suficien- 
temente humana para sentir Is 
incomensurable perdida por }a 
muerte de aquel, reunio todo el 
coraje y sabiduria de que podia 
disponer de su legado, y se de- 
cidio a continuar las luchas de sit 
esposo cuando vivia. Fue ella 
quien sirvio de guia, que deter- 
mino el curso de la vida publics, 
de su esposo. Estabilizo y afir- 
mo sus movimientos y sus con- 
vicciones, cuando se dedico a sus 
agresivas y patrioticas emoresas, 



en el pinaculo de su fuerza, po- 
der e influencia como caudillo de 
su pueblo. Las vicisitudes del 
marido en sus grandes batallas 
por la vida, le hicieron volver 
los ojos hacia la suerte del horo- 
bre comun. Pero fue ella la que 
conmovio y ablando su corazon, y 
le impulso a ser campeon de las 
ma ras y de los desneredados de 
la fortuna. La justicia social del; 
Presidente Quezon fue la inspi- 
ration y la pasion de Aurora 
Quezon. 

"Aurora Aragon Quezon no fue 
solamente la primera de las Pri- 
meras Damas del pais. Por pro- 
pio derecho, fue sencillamente 
grande! La insuperable dignidad, 
sabiduria y gracia, con que cum- 
plio su responsabilidad hacia la 
nacion despues de la muerte del 
Presidente Quezon, no fueron ac- 
cidentes vinieron como la flora- 
cion de una vida plena de res- 
ponsabilidades, de devocion y de 



.camaraderia. Cuando acepto la 
jefatura de nuestra Cruz Roja 
Nacional, accedio sencillamente a 
dar confirmacion formal en su 
propio derecho, de ser de hecho f 
y de verdad, la madre de su puW 
bio. 

No presto meramente su nom- 
bre, grande como era, a la cau- 
sa. Laboro grandemente, traba- 
jando como otro cualquiera que 
pertenecia a la peregrinaciori, y 
la proveyo de la mas honda y 
cumplida inspiracion. Nuestro 
pueblo puede que ahora no sepa 
quien fue mas grande, Quezon, el 
Padre de su patria, o Aurora 
Aragon Quezon la verdaderamen- 
te madre simbolica de su raza 
Pero la historia registrara a lr* 
dos como los mas grandes 
hechores de esta generacion, 
Sra. de Quezon como la \ 
, grande mujer de su patria/' i 




^ VOZ DE MANILA, Mierc oles, 3 de Mayo de 1949< 

iFilipinas, Piensa Y Dtspierta! 

Por J. M. CHICOTE \ 

Ha tenido que ocurrir una tra- numero de descarriados, victimas 
gedia que afectara hondamente de la ignorancia y equivocacion, 
al pueblo f ilipino para que este pobres creyentes de las palabras 
despertara de la somnolencia en de unos cuantos desalmados "je- 



que se encontraba con respecto 
al peligro del comunismo en Fi- 
lipinas. 

Quiso tal vez la divina provi- 
flencia ofrendar las vidas mas 
preclaras y queridas del pueblo 
filipino para que el archipielago 
entero se levantara indignado y 
demandara el castigo de los ver- 
dugos y la exterminacion total de 
los disidentes que aqui los llaman 
"Hukbalahaps" y que en otras 
partes del mundo son mejor cono- 
cidos como comunistas, bichos as 
querosos que han vendido sus al- 
mas a Rusia para derrogar go- 
bierhos constituidos por el pue 
bio, crear el eaos e implantar la 
"libertaxT del proietariado, esa 
"libertadV que en el diccionario 
del comunista significa libertina 
je y defensa de unos principios 
tan bajos, mercenarios y nausea- 
bundos, que la iglesia catolica no 
ha tenido otro remedio que con- 
denar tan malefica doctrina, po- 
niendo en boca de su suprema ca- 
beza aquellas cinco palabras que 
encierran toda una verdad: "El 
COMUNISMO ES INTRINSICA- 
MENT7- MAJLO". 

El comunismo es un antrax cu- 
jfas raices van poco a poco arrai- 
gandose en el cuerpo de una na- 
cion. Si no se extirpa a tiempo 
la afeccion, el cuerpo va decayen- 
do en salud y acaba ultimamente 
siendo victima de tan fatal enfer- 
medacL 

Vea Filipinas su porvenir en el 
espejo de otras naciones victimas 
del comunismo, que hoy gimen 
bajo ci terror moscovita, y deje 
aparte esas puntillosidades y re- 
milgos tan "suis generis" en una 
democracia, paca que asi pueda 
facllmente atacar ese antrax que 
hoy empieza a extenderse por 
todo & cuerpo del pueblo filipino. 

i Muerte y exterminio al comu- 
nismo! primero y ante todo, con 
armas, que son el bisturi que ha 
de extirpar el antrax que hoy nos 
3queja, y despues, con ideas, doc- 
trinas e ideales sanos, que son la 
medicina que se debe aplicar para 
aplacar los doiores de la opera- 
tion, atrayendo con ello ese gran 



fecillos" pagados con dinero de 
Rusia, que por treinta monedas, 
venden su patria y abren sus 
fronteras al crimen y al desmenv 
bramiento nacional. 

iAbre los ojos Filipinas! y con 
tempfa esos cuerpos destrozados 
por las balas y piensa que otros 
mas caeran mientras tu no des 
piertes de tu letargo. No des la 
mano a esos escritores que en la 
prensa justifican la actitud de los 
disidentes y que con el veneno de 
la tinta de imprenta, les animan 
a cometer mas depradaciones. 
Piensa que la Democracia nos da 
libertad de culto, de palabra 
de prensa, cuyas tres libertades 
no respetan los comunistas; pien- 
sa que el dia que estos se hagan 
fuertes, arderan las iglesias y ro 
daran las cabezas de hiiles que 
no piensen como eilos; piensa que 
tu libertad, la de tus hijos y la 
de los hijos de tus hijos esta en 
peligro de desaparecer. \ PIEN-

Tirana Evoca Bondades 
De Aurora Ue Quezon 

El Senador Emiano T. Tirona 
declaro que como ciudadano pri- 
vado lamentaba profundamente 
la muerte tragica de la Sra. de 
Quezon, la cual, siempre habia 
mantenido relaciones amistosas 
aun con los que durante el tiem- 
po del difunto Presidente Quezon 
estaban en la oposicion. La Sra. 
de Quezon fue la madrina de la 
hija menor del Senador Tirona. 
'Mi senora y yo nunca olvidare- 
mos su solicitud por su ahijada 
que estaba gravemente enferma 
cuando fue bautizada, y tambien* 
por su afecto y atencion a nues- 
tro pequeno bebe durante nuestro 
viaje de Europa a Manila en 
1933. 

Con respecto a Philip Buenca-; 
mino III, el Senador Tirona re- 
cordo que este fue muy cortes y 
atento a los senadores filipinos, 
que asistieron a la conferencia de 
la union inter-parlamentaria en 
Roma. Finalmente expreso su 
prof undo pesar por la muerte de 
Baby Quezon y otros miembros 
de la comitiva de Quezon, como 
el Coronel Primitivo San Agus- 
tin, el Teniente Coronel Antonio 
San Agustin y los Tenientes La- 
zam, Arabejo y Molina y los sol- 
dados Almarines y Valdes.

Como al rey Aquis, de que ha-

Oe Meda, Cartas Con 



El Comandante Eugenio To- 
rres, jefe del servicio secreto de 
la Policia de Manila, asigno ayer 
a un teniente y dos agentes secre- 
tos para que sirvan de guardaes- 
paldas de Nini Quezon Buencami- 
no y de Nonong Quezon, en vista , 

^r^L C ^ rtas ^ noni mas recibidas 
Por los dos umcos supervivientes 
a© la familia Quezon. 

Los asignados ayer tarde por 
el Jefe Torres fueron el Teniente 
^}ron y dos agentes. Estos se 
amgieron anoche mismo a pre- 
sentarse a los Quezon para la 
jasastencia de estos en las exequias 
Junebre por Dna. Aurora y su 
Hija Baby celebradas en la capi- 
ta de Malacanang. 

Las nptas amenazadoras, en las 
que se decia que habia el plan 
de "liquidar" a toda la familial 
Quezon, se recibieron hace unos | 
dias, por lo que se movilizo a los 
agentes de la NBI y la Constabu- 
laria alrededor de la residencia ' 
de los Quezon en Gilmore Ave- 
nue, New Manila. Ayer, el Ma- 
gistrado Manuel Lim pidio al Jefe 
del Servicio Secreto que, dentro 
de la ciudad de Manila, se toma- 
ran las mismas precauciones. 

Aunque las agencias policiacas j 
estan trabajando para lograr des- | 
cubrir la identidad de los autores i 
de la carta anonima, la teoria j 
predominante es que la nota reci- 
bida fue escrita por algun sujeto 
que esta tratando de despistar a 
las autoridades, en relacion con 
la salvaje emboscada, o para 
amedrantar y mortificar a los dos 
hijos de Dna. Aurora por alguna 
razon personal. 

Por otro lado, las cartas ano- 
nimas amenazadoras se han po- 
pularizado en Manila, y tres fun- 
cionarios de la ciudad las han re- 
cibido tambien en relacion coir el 
propuesto enjuiciamiento de jefes 
comunistas de Manila. Los tres 
' funcionarios arhenazados son: el 
Alcalde Manuel de la Fuente, el 
Fiscal de la Ciudad Eugenio An- 
igeles y el Jefe Investigador Abe- 
lardo Subido. Los tres fueron 
amenazados de muerte, se presen- 
ten o no las denuncias contra Ma- 
riano Balgos, Guillermo Capado- 
cia, y otros. 

"El retiro de las denuncir.s con- 
tra nuestros caudillos no han de 
salvaros de la muerte." Estas 
son las palabras contenidas en 
las cartas amenazadoras. Al la- 
do izquierdo del final de las car- 
tas, esta escrita la palabra "Li- 
bertad" y al lado derecho "Eman- 
cipacion". 

El Alcalde Manuel de la Fuente 
habia retirado provisionalmente 
los papeles denunciando a Balgos, 
Capadocia y otros, por activida- 
des subversivas, pero despues las! 
volvio a enviar al Fiscal Ange- j 
les para su revision. 




Surviving Members 
Of Quezon Family 
Receive Threats 

The Philippine constabulary and 
Quezon City police adopted secu- v 
rity measures upon receipt of re- 
ports that the surviving members 
ot : the Quezon family were being 
threatened with harm by "un- 
known elements." 

Reports on the threats were re- 
layed to the police authorities by 
Dr. Luis Alandy, a friend of the 
Quezon family and survivor of the 
Huk ambuscade on the Bongabon- 
Baler road which claimed the lives 
of Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon, her 
daughter Baby, her son-in-law 
Philip Buencamino III and nine 
others. 

Both the constabulary and the 
Quezon City police were under- 
stood to have maintained a con- 
stant patrol of the area and to 
have taken other steps to safe- 
guard the life and security of peo- 
ple residing in tho Quezon home j 
on Gilmore Avenue, Quezon City. 



De la Fuente dijo que habia 
pedido al Fiscal AngeJes la revi- 
sion de las actividades iel "Ea- 
tallon do Trabajadores" y de la 
"Asociacion de Vigilantes Contra 
Ataques Aereos" que estan enca- 
bezados por Balgos y Capadocia. 
Si las actividades de estas dos 
asociaciones tienen algo de sub- 
versivas, la accion sera endosavia 
a las autoridades nacionales, 
dijo el Alcalde. 

La cuestion de declarar sub- 
versiva una asociacion, segun Dc 
'n Fuente, esta en manos de las 
autoridades nacionales. Si estas 
io declaran asi, entonces, pond re 
en vigor la decision, dijo De la 
Fuente. 

El Alcalde dijo taml ien qu2 la 
publicacion de la supuesta denun- 
cia contra Balgos y Capadocia, 
rra incorrecta, pero que habia sa- 
cado a la luz el hecho de que 
los caudillos comunistas estan 
cobrando una cuota de P2.90 de 
los miembros de las dos asocia- 
ciones mencionadas, con el pre- 
texto de lograr el "back pay" de 
los mismos. El Alcalde De la 
Fuente dijo que el estaba dis- 
puesto a trabajar por el "back 
pay" de • los mismos, sin cobrar 
un centime. 



eports of Death 
Threats Berated 

The reported receipt of death 
notes by Mayor de la Fuente 
and City Fiscal Eugenio Ange 
I - - ' described bv the Com- 
munist party last night as an- 
other diversionary move of the 
administration to mislead the 
people from the real problems 
"hi fronting: the people today. 

The death notes allegedly 
mentioned -thai "your m •,. 
drawal of the charges against 
our leaders will not stop us to 
kill yon." They evidently re- 
ferred to the charges of ill 
association preferred by M 
De la Fuente recently against 
Mariano P. Balgos. s< 
general of the local Commun- 
ist Party, and Guillermo Capa- 
docia, and which have been 
withdrawn from Fiscal An - 
les' office. 

In a joint statement to the 
press last night, Balgos and 
Capadocia declared that "Com. 
mutilate are not terrorisl ." 
They called the threat let I 
as "part of the world-wide pro- 
vocation of the reactionaries 
and imperialist to smear and 
provoke the Communist par- 
ties." They said that its pur- 
pose Is "to mold a public opi- 
nion which will justify any act 
of gangsterism against the 
Communists and the progres- 
sives." 

"We are against anarchism, 
force and violence," the state- 
I ment said. "If the workers 
and peasants in many countries 
are fighting, It Is because they 
ar e forced by the reactionaries 
and imperialists who utilize 
force and violence against the 
workers and peasants move- 
ment." 

Meanwhile, the CLO has 

alerted all local waterfront Ardfl 
marine workers union to give 
the S. 8. flfcel Designer a "h^tH 
reception." The shin, which is I 
reportedly bringing "hot csr-^2 
go'* to the Philippines', eseanrfl

The nation was plunged into mourning Thursday last week when ft 
learned of the tragic death of Mrs. Quezon, and 11 others in her -party, 
including her daughter, "Baby" Maria Aurora and her son-in-law Philip 
Buencamino III, while they were on their way to Baler, Quezon. It waj 
incredible that anyone should want to do harm to the kindly widow of th' 
late President Quezon or to any member of her family. She was belove( 
by the people not only because she was the widow of the great leader bu 
also because of her own character. 

Since her return to the Philippines after liberation, no longer the Firsl j 
Lady of the land, Mrs. Quezon had devoted herself to social welfare work.' 
At the time of her death, she was national chairman of the Philippine Na-' 
tional Red Cross. i
