Sanitation and General Hygiene - 

1 a ter is good and piped from Aschoff eriburg. Toilets oro 
apparently clean but very ill- smelling* The excrement ia haul; 
necessary, away from the camp. The barracks are dirty. 1 e ticking 
and blankets -re never changed, but sprinkled with pondered neftelin© 
every fifteen days* The ventilation of the barracks is very poor. The 
Clothing of prisoners has not been disinfected for almo; t a ye r 
on account of lack of co n l to heat the disinfector, as coal 'l 3 saved 
for the disinfection of the clothing of patients. Each barrack ?. 
heated by one stove and prisoners complained of cold. F: • V. oncrc rsh 
their own clothes but have no soap- There is a bath house with 1G 
showers, undressing and dres sing room and a large disinfect or. The 
prisoners bathe once every three weeks only, on account of lac-: f 

coal. 



Suggestions made by officer of the camp a* to require . cuts* 

Cooking lard, bread, meat, potatoes, macaroni, v: leewe T 
and socks should be. furnished at once. 

General Impressions - 

The prisoners are very anxious to return hate, but :. r c 
found no political propaganda. The German command seems desirous of 
the prisoners as comffttable as their means will permit. There 5.3 
some tendency among the prisoners to use ill reading room which Is 
p oviaed by the Germans-, but all literature is carefully inspected 
by the interpreter in order to prevent any political propa.gr; no. a 
reaching the pri suers. 

In conclusion we were ..ost courteously and cordially 
received by the officers of the ca: p and every assistance given us to 
obtain any information we desired, e enclose a paper handed to us 
by one of the prisoners, wriiten in Russian, which he said was for the 
Allied Commission in Berlin* "e also enclose the address of , 
Dr.Friedleiss, who will be glad to receive the few supplies he ~a 
requested.
