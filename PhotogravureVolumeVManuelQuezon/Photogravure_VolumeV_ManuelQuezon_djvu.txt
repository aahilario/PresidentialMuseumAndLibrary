and relatives. He succumbed to an old lung trouble that was aggra- 
vated by his recent political campaigns in Tayabas. Botn in Quezon's

Editorial 



LINE TO THE SOUTH 
The official linking with appropriate cere- 
monies of the Bicol line with the main trunk 
of the Manila Railroad Company at the town 
of Del Gallego, Camarines Sur, marks the be- 
ginning of a new era in Philippine railroad 
transportation. Across a formidable gap hither- 
to negotiated by means of an ovorwater trip 
of several hours, the rails have been strung to 
enable the traveler to make the long Manila-to- 
Legaspl trip in the space of 12 hours. 

The achievement is a credit to the efficient 
management of the Manila Railroad Company. 
Through many lean years, during which it has 
been the object of severe criitcism, it emerges 
today out of the red, not only in the matter of 
finances, but in that of demonstrated initiative 
and enterprise. . . . 

The completion of the Manila-to-Legaspi 
line and the discontinuance of unimportant 
lines shows that the company is figuring on 
the long pulls to carry its indispensable service 
to the people.

Francis Bowes Sayre: next U. S. High 
Commissioner to the Philippines? 




HIS intimate acquaintance with Philippine affairs made primarily 
through the part he played as head of the interdepartmental com- 
mittee and honorary chairman of the Joint Preparatory Committee 
on Philippine Affairs (JPCPA) makes Assistant Secretary of 
State Francis Bowes Sayre, 63, left, most probable choice as suc- 
cessor to High Commissioner Paul Vories McNutt when the latter 
resigns next October, highly authoritative Washington political ex- 
perts believe. Some commentators however discount the choice be- 



cause Sayre is reported unsympathetic with President Roosevelt's 
policy toward the Philippines, has some ambitions for a higher 
post in the federal government. Son-in-law of the late President 
Thomas Woodrow Wilson, Sayre was professor of law at Harvard 
(1929-1934), adviser in foreign affairs to the Siamese government 
(1923-1925), was appointed to his present Washington post in 
1933. He is shown with President Quezon chatting during a meet- 
ing of the JPCPA in Washington. April 19, 1937.

Cebu inaugurates a magnificent 
provincial capitol, hears Quezon 
praise its great leaders 




PRESWEXT Ql EZON 



ADMITTEDLY one of today's 
most magnificent public edifices 
in the Philippines is feint's 
provincial capitol. The building, which took two years to build, 
was June 1-1 inaugurated, with President Quezon as guest of honor. 

Sonic 20.000 fchunnos and visitors from nearby provinces 
witnessed the impressive ceremony with which the building was 
inaugurated, heard the President deliver an impassioned, Stirring, 
spicy Speech. Thrilled were mcst fchunnos to hear him de- 
monstrate an amazing knowledge of the building's history by 
tracing its origin and how it came into being. Pleased was Cebu's 
Man of the Hour. Sergio Osmena, when the President referred 

to him a* the one who first conceived of erecting a provincial 

capitol worthy of his province and people. The guest of honor 
also included in his humorous sallies the incumbent provincial 
governor, Buenaventura Rodriguez, referring to him as the most 

"unfortunate" man during the occasion- --unfortunate, because he 
(the President) had considered dismissing the provincial governor 

and appointing himself to take his place for daring to have an 
office biggOr than that Of tfae President of the Commonwealth's. 



MAJESTICALLY and calmly lying at anchor in the placid wa- 
ters of Cebu is the swanky Presidential Yacht Cosiitiin. It's all 
decked with gay buntings, significant of the big occasion. 



The lengthy speech was deliver- 
ed in English, was translated GOVERNOR RODRIGUEZ 
into the Cebuano dialect by Jus- 
tice Manuel Briones. of the Court of Appeals. 

Tlie capitol cost the province of Cebu about half a million 
pesos; raised by sale of bonds which was approved May. 1936 by 
President Quezon. The plans were prepared by g-cvernment 
Architect Juan Arellano who completed the same fully one year 
prior to the laying of cornerstone on June 27, 1936. by the Chief 
Executive. Builders were Pedro Siochi and Co.. well-known Ma- 
nila building contractors. The land on which the capitol stands 
once belonged to the Osmenas, was sold to Cebu Heights Co., 
owned by the Bank of the P. I., Vicente Madrigal and Jose Ara- 
neta, and later donated to the province. 

Sponsors for the inauguration were the wives of the Pres- 
ident and Vice-President of the Philippines, both of w ;om were 
absent, Mrs. Mariano Jesus Cuenco, Mrs. Sotero Cabahug, Mrs. 
Buenaventura Rodriguez. Mrs. Andrea H. Roa, and Mrs. Juan 0. 
Climaeo. Aurora ("Baby") Quezon took the place of her mother, 
while Mrs. Rodriguez performed the actual christening with an 

lS-peso bottle of champagne. ^"a/P'c

DE LA SALLE COLLEGE y.M'.OYK), ARISTOCRATIC SECTARIAN INSTITUTION IN MANILA, WAS FOUNDED IN 1911. 



Nonong Quezon goes to school at De La Salle college 



TRAVEL is generally accepted as an effective means of 
educating one's self. It broadens one's education. A 
pari of the education of twelve-year-old Nonong, only 
son of President Manuel L. Quezon, has been obtained 
through travel. In a few of his extensive trips abroad, 
the President took along his child, consequently inter- 
rupted the boy's studies in school. Nonong's travels and 
great opportunities lor contact in foreign countries, 
however, made up for what academic, training he lost 
ii; school. He is a smart pupil, can carry on a good con- 
versation and dabble freely on travel topics. 

This year, Nonong is back at the intermediate de- 
partment of St. John Baptist de La Salle college, a sixth- 
grader under the tutelage of kind sagacious Christian 
Brothers. His father went to school in the Colegio de 
San Juan de Let ran. Every schoolday. at about 7:45 
o'clock a.m.. Nonong's mother, the First Lady of the 
Land, combs the child's hair for a finishing touch, checks 
on the handkerchiefs in his pockets, and after saying the 
fond "bye-bye" amenities the boy gets into a big Xo. 
1 limousine that whisks him out of Malacanan Palace 
grounds to the college. Nonong conies home at 12 noon, 
and goes out to school again at 1 :.*>0 p.m. More often 
than not In- is the only passenger in the big car. 

Enjoying the same privileges and subjected to the 
same strict school regulations like any other pupil, the 
President's son is by no means a favored boy in the class- 
room. He likes mathematics and loves to juggle figures, 
but his report card shows he is better in grammar and 
catechism. He has a small, firm voice that shows po- 
tentialities for good oratory when developed and mature. 
Regarded as a "reg'lar fellow" by his schoolmates. No- 
nong is a typical boy on the campus, lie wears short 
pants, is fond of short-sleeved, open shirt. He carries 
his books and pencils in a bag, kicks the football during 
recess. Nonong has many dreams of the future, but he 
can't tell which one he cherishes most. 




GRABBING his constant school-companion, a cloth-pouch 
books, noto-books, Nonong jumps out of the car, rushes to clas 





IS HAVING his "ordeal" at the blackboard analyzing a sen- ATHLETICS is part of the school training, and Nonong, a pros- 
» as his shirt clumsily comes out of his pants in the back. pective full-back, listens attentively to a Brothers pointers. 




MANUEL QUEZON JR. looks every inch like his illustrious father 
when he beams or scowls. Brother Lucian (above) is showing him 



a p.age in a text-book to which Nonong reacts with knitted brows 
and a sour face. The good Brother sees what he can do about it.

was enunciated by PRESIDENT QUEZON in his message to the National Assembly in 
special session Monday. He would not deprive the Assembly of its power to pass the 
the religious instruction bill oveW his .veto, but reiterated his opinion that the bill is

URORA 



— 




A CLOSE-VP of the attractive clusters of "flowers," which are really leaves 
of this new plant discovered at Mount Makiling. 

THIS NEW PLANT FOR MANILA'S GARDENS, NAMED 
AFTER MRS. QUEZON, IS FOUND ONLY IN THE PHILIP- 
PINES... THE FIRST LADY OF THE LAND PLANTED 
IT IN THE QUEZON PREVENTORIUM AT ITS INAUGU- 
RATION LAST WEEK. . . 



VERY ORNAMENTAL for Manila's gardens is the Dona Aurora which 
grows splendidly and presents a very attractive appearance. 



ing care in which the plant was sur- 
rounded showed results for soon they 
could see its splendid green foliage ' 
with clusters of white leaf-like struc- 
tures. 

The plant was very similar to its 
mother species, Mussaenda philippics, 
in 1 every respect. It differs however 
very markedly in the following feat- 
ures: The genus Mussaenda philippica 
-is characterized hy one of its calyx 
lobes developing and enlarging into a 
leaf-like structure producing various 
colors of white, red and orange. The 
rest of the calyx-lobe3, four in nunv 
ber, remain green. 



In the Dona Aurora, instead of one 
calyx-lobe developing into a leaf-like 
structure, four or five calyx-lobes <ie- 
velope into these leaf-like structures 
producing attractive clusters of snow- 
white "flowers," that form a very 
striking contrast to its very green 
foliage. 

The plant as far as is known 1a 
sterile as it has never produced fruits 
or seeds. So far only five marcots 
have been obtained from the plant as 
it is feared that mutilation and exces- 
sive marcottings may kill the mother 
Turn to page 45 



JyJAMED after the First Lady of the 
Land and hailed as a new dis- 
covery in the plant kingdom of the 
Philippines is a very rare and orna- 
mental "garden variety that grows to a 
•splendid height and bears, besides its 
brilliant green foliage, close sprigs of 
snow-white ''flowers," borne in snch 
dusters as to rival in number the very 
foliage itself. 

This truly remarkable-looking plant 
is found only in the Philippines and 
was recently discovered at the foot of 
Mount Makiling at an altitude of 
about 100 meters. One might almost 
say that it was a re-discovery because 
the original collection was made by 
Professor C. Mabesa way back in 1915 
near the place where it was accidental- 
ly re-diseovered by one of the employ- 
ees of the Bureau of Forestry. 

A specimen from the first original 
plant had once been shown to former 
Director Merrill of the Bureau of 
Science. The plant then was in a 
dried state and Dr. Merrill, not hav- 
ing seen the plant in its living condi- 
tion, classified the specimen as Mus- 
saenda philippica, W hich is a very com- 
mon species in Mount Makiling. 

In 1930, however, during one of 
Professor Curran's excursions to 
Mount Makiling, he accidentally saw a 
beautiful variety of Mussaenda Philip- 
Pica to which he was very much at- 
tracted. The newly re-discovered 
Plant was found in practically the 
same place from which the same speci- 
men sent to Dr. Merrill was taken. 

Professor Curran had the plant dug 
»P and transplanted in the Schpol of 
f orestry Nursery at Los Bafios, where 
W was carefully tended. The unceas-

twig on it and raising the right hand to "commend the spirit of the deceased to his 
Creator." Anderson came to the Philippines in 1900 with the United States Army.

Manila, November 12, 1938. 

The Volcanic Quezon 

u • ,ht is a mask, with a surrealist touch, of Pres- 
V If W who marks the half-way point of his 
ident Manuel L. ^ L " n >\ ^ the three years that 

^ T nThi!" tn have taken up more space in the Phil- 
S ^ntose of any other individual. And with good 
ST For the President's actions are even more dramatic 
than those of perfect-coned Mayon. 

If you stop to think of it, the human volcano at Malaca- 
nang has much in common with its natural counterpart on the 
Bicol peninsula. Both are in a constant state of minor erup- 
tion moved by cosmic forces over which they have no control. 
Major eruptions on the part of either generally result in wide- 
spread havoc, but once the fire has gone out- of their lava the 
countryside is richer for the explosion. The most pervading 
similarity of all is that the man and the mountain both dominate 
the landscapes in which they have been placed. The Philip- 
pine Commonwealth without President Quezon would be like 
the Bicol region without Mayon. The loss of either would mark 
a void which probably never could be filled. 

[PhoiOffrapkie lirprmhirtion by Sun Studio) 




ill 




The Beatific Osmena 



On the left is another mask, even more markedly surrealis- 
tic than that above, of Vice-President Sergio Osmena. The faint 
halo around his head is more real than fancied. In the calm 
presence of the Vice-President one feels something of the at- 
mosphere of a highly-vaulted cathedral. Nor does Mr. Osmefia's 
record belie this impression. Always he has lived his life above 
the level of ordinary politics, keeping his public and private 
actions beyond reproach. 

The zipper on Mr. Osmefia's mouth has been placed there 
by Mr. Osmena. himself. No reporter could ever get the Vice- 
President, to say something which he did not plan to say at the 
start of the interview— a task fairly easy to accomplish with 
President Quezon. Mr. Osmena can say plenty when he de- 
sires to do so; but he has long known the value of enhancing 
his beatific smile with an enigmatic silence. He knows that in 
the final analysis his public record will be summed up by his 
deeds, not his words. That is why he can afford to be chary 
with his words. 

These masks were prepared, with malice toward none bv 
Ksmeraldo Izon, head of the Free Press art staff. They were 
displayed a fortnight ago at the Beaux Arts ball in Manila 
wherS they attracted so much attention that it was decided to 
reproduce them here.
