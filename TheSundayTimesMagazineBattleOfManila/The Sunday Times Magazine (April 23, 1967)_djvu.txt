HUNTING 
SNIPERS 

DURING THE BATTLE OF MANILA, 
Japanese marines used the church belfries 
to either spy on the American and Filipino 
guerrillas — or snipe at them. The view from 
the church belfry is a commanding one, 
since it is usually the highest point in a 
neighborhood. Sensing this, the advancing 
American forces brought out their 37 mm. 
guns to blast the Japanese belfry occupants 
to kingdom come. Here on this spread are 
the stories of two church towers — one in 
Sta. Cruz church and the other at San Agus- 
tin, Intramuros.

THE Dm 
THE LIBERA 



FORMOSA or Luzon? That 
was the question the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff had de- 
bated shortly before the 
American forces successful- 
ly landed at Leyte. But 
Mac Arthur, who was bent 
from the beginning on libe- 
rating Luzon immediately 
after Leyte, won, On Octob- 
er 3, 1944 t or two weeks be- 
fore Leyte A-Day, the JCS 
reached a decision favoring 
MacArthur. 

For the generals, it did 
seem difficult to decide 
whether a landing on Luzon 
or on Formosa or some- 
where else should follow 
Leyte. Admiral King who 
strongly differed with Mac- 
Arthur had been insistent 
on the Formosa— first plan. 
He had made the generals 
glance at the chart of the 
Western Pacific which sug- 
gested many arguments 
favoring the taking of For- 
mosa, including a beachhead 
at Amoy on continental 
China, King theorized that 
it would "put a cork in the 
bottleneck of Japan's com- 
munications with her con- 
quests of 1942," Moreover, 
Formosa was "a step near- 
er the enemy' s heart than 
Luzon. To invade Formosa 
after Leyte would continue 
the successful 'leap-frog 
strategy' leaving the most 
powerful Japanese strong 
points (of which Luzon was 
one) to wither on the vine/* 
MacArthur dispute^ 
King's arguments with both 
practical and political con- 
siderations. The invasion of 
Formosa which was in Ad- 
miral Nimifz's bailiwick 
would need troops. Nimitz 
who did not have nearly 
enough troops could get 
none from Europe until 
Germany surrendered nor 
cculd he borrow frcm Mac- 
Arthur who already had his 
troop s on loan from Pacific 
Ocean areas. Furthermore, 
MacArthur would not let 
Formosa be substituted for 
Luzon. He put more value 
cn having a loyal and coop- 
erative population like the 
Filipinos to help the US

(One morning in February, 1945, a loud explo- 
sion startled the congregation attending Moss at 
the Malate church* One explosion followed another 
and smoke blackened the skies. It was not the 
Americans bombing Manila but the Japanese who 
were demolishing military installations. 

STM staff member Lydia Gutierrez was one of 
those in the church. At that moment, she thought 
of the idea of recording the succeeding events-m a 
diary. Together with 16 other members in her fa- 
mily [including one in-law and baby nepheui she 
spent many days and nights in a dugout. Here are 
eoccerpts from that diary, prepared in the idiom cy 
a 14-year-old.} 



SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1915 

The same half-boring, half-scary life. Early 
in the afternoon Papa, Frank and Nong came 
heme with 3 bayongful s of money. (Papa had 
mortgaged the farm,) We knew that the Ameri- 
cans were near so we decided to spend the Jap- 
anese money quickly. 

Mama and all of us went back and forth to 
San Andres market. We bought brown sugar at 
rSOO.OO a kilo; red beans at f4Q0.00 a kilo; chick- 
en eggs at PlOOvOO each, A bcttle of peanut but- 
ter was P80OOO; coconuts were M50.00 each; cas- 
sava flour P5OO0O a kilo; coconut oil P8<MX) a 
tansan bottle. Rice was H, 800.00 a ganta. (Some 
sellers asked fl8.00 Philippine money,) We 
couldn't buy more as the sellers just brought 
the goods tp the market little by little. And then 
12 Japanese soldiers, surrounded the market to 
get all the food. We escaped and ran heme as 
fast as we could. 

•Baby and I spent tua night in Frank and 
Josie's at Georgia st It was 9 p.m., but the skies 
were red and orange and bright like sunset be- 
cause of the fires. We watched the fires from 
the porch and then went to bed. But I couldn't 
sleep. T lay awake t I was very impatient and 
homesick- By midnight, we could hear faint 
machinegunning and shooting. But the sound was 
so far, far away. The night seemed so leng. 



SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1945 



After -Mass we went to market again. The 
girls dropped by from home and told lis that 
Emy said that there was news from the Que mas 
that the Americans arrived last night in Caloocan 
and were coming towards Rizal Ave. That's why 
we heard the machinegunning. It was so hard to 
believe! The majority of the people heard the 
good news and rushed to the market. The mar- 
ket .was almost empty. There were just hard 
kernels of yellow corn, a few coconuts and kang- 
kong and talinum. 

Papa bought a big pushcart for ^5,000,000 and 
a smaller one for F^OOO.OO. Mama bought meat 
lor H.500.00 a kilo, 

The Japs looked desperate. They were very, 
very strict with the people. People were slapped 
more often without knowing why. 

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1945 

Few people walked out in the streets be- 
cause of the shelling. The shrapnels fell like 
scattered stones on rocftcps. Ey midnight shells 
came nearer. Frank and Josie got up and brought 
Bobby down. Baby and I followed. It was damp 
and cold at the landing cf the stairs. But we 
spent the rest of the night there, Frank brought 
a small suitcase and foodstuffs in case we'd 
have to run. Then I went up tc get more blankets 
but when I reached the top of the stairs I couldn't 
move because I was afraid. But I ran into the 
room, pulled the blankets and ran down the 
stairs. The cement steps where we lay were so 
cold and my bones ached. Frank put an oil lamp 
and played with cards to keep awake. I slept 
very little. 



Liberation Diary 




THE 

LON6ES1 
WAIT 



By LYDIA C GUTIERREZ 



FRIDAY. FERRARY ». 1945 

We awoke hearing the rumbling of tanks 
We thought they were American tanks but we 
were mistaken. We spent the whole morning 
downstairs. We only went up in the afternoon 
but were alert and ready to run down t when- 
ever a shell burst. The time passed so slowly. 
How dreary? We ate early and decided to sleep 
on the cement steps and the landing. w 

Around 10 p.m, we heard a great commo- 
tion. There were two big fires, one in Irasan and 
one on Leveriza st. All the people were running 
back and forth carrying their possessions and 
piling them up on the sidewalks. The streets were 
noisy and crowded with people talking and run- 
ning with their belongings. Frank brought Josie 
and Bobby home and told Baby and I to watch 
the house, We were so afraid. We started folding 
blankets and packing. Frank came back with 
the others from home with a pushcart. They 
made several trips, Frank and I brought down 
the refrigerator with Baby putting a sack under- 
neath so we could slide it down the two flights 
of stairs, Into the yard and on the sidewalk. But 
the fire was getting nearer so we left it and 
saved the other things. From home we watched 
the houses burn one by one. No one stopped the 
fire as there was no water in the fire hydrants. 
The whole Kalaw Court was burned and the 
whole block {bound by Georgia, San Andres, Re- 
medies and Florida sts,). The fire stopped by 
itself around 3 a m. We all ate coffee and palUao 
at 4 a.m. and then we lay down and rested, feel- 
ing very sad. 

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 10 t 1945 

When it got bright we started fixing our 
house. We were preparing the whole day to run 
away. For my knapsack I got a nepa bag and 
put one change cf clothing, my veil, rosary, 
and some clean strips of cloth in case anyone 
got wounded. Mama gave each of us rice red 
beans and some money. We also were givpn a 
tag with our name and address (613 Remetiios 
Malate, Manila) written in India ink. We pin- 
ned it with our blessed Miraculous medals. We 
were never to remove it. 

Wc packed our pushcarts with food, clothes 
nnd cooking utensils and left one empty for the 
children to ride. The shelling was getting worse 
and worse, so that we could not even go outdoors 
to get water from the well. 



SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 194$

housework but once in a while 
down the trapdoor to the dugout

them in their shelters. They got 
their families. We gave them wat

time to go. We pushed our pushc 
trips back and forth. Among last 
ruin s we found many little roofs 
under them. Frank found an emj

stood and we pulled a piece of zii

ladors* and Montes' house made 
an oven. We turned left. We 

walked nervously holding on to 



each other, afraid of stepping on parts of dead 
bodies. We reached Vermont and the Vasquez 
house but they didn't let us in because it was a 
Red Cross headquarters and none of us were 
wounded. We reached Tennessee st. and turned 
left. At Georgia st. we saw four Japs and they 
saw us! We ran fast into a building. We hid a 
while but were afraid there might be Japs in 
the building. Then Nong peeped and they were 
gone, Thank God! We turned left on Georgia 
and came to Vermont and turned right till we 
reached the corner of Florida st, at last! Two 
blocks away was our shelter among the ruins 
but it was too hot to pass. But if we stood there, 
the Japs might see us. So Nong thought we'd 
better dash through the hot street. Irasan was 
burning. We saw many dead bodies. Most of 
them we knew. We came near the place where 
we' had our shelter. It was very, very quiet, not 
a soul. There were dead bodies all over" the 
place. When we came to our place what a mess 
it was! We came nearer, and called Frank no- 
body answered. Thtn we called Chars and Ini 
and Chito but nobody answered. We approach- 
ed reluctantly. We saw Ini and Frank but we 
saw blood. We didn't know who was wounded. 
It was Chito! We did not expect it to be him. 
When they saw us they were so surprised! Most 
of us cried and cried. They said they saw our 
house being hit directly and then bursting in 
flames and they were Sure we were all dead. 
They told us that Chito was sitting and a sharp- 
nel went through his leg, took out a piece of his 
hand and hit the ether leg. When Chito heard that 
his friend Ding-ding died, he cried and cried 
The shells never stopped one after the 
other and when they burst the smoke and ashes 
came under the tables and we were all fainting 
one by one. There was a man with one arm 
gone and he was delirious and quarreling with 
another man under a roof nearby. The judge 
was drinking and he was desperate and crying. 
He said his wife and all his other children died. 
He told us to take his daughter if he dies. Chars 
ran out to look for medicine and came back 
with a sleeping tablet from Mrs, Kalaw but the 
Japs almost saw her on her way back. A man 
just pulled her back as she was beginning to 
cross the street. Then the Japs ' came to the 
street and we had to stop the children from cry- 
ing and had to remain very quiet Again all the 
shells fell in our vicinity and debris, stones and 
sharpnels were falling all over. The people were 
screaming and crying around us. We clung to 
our medals and prayed and prayed. One shell 
fell right near us and we choked and coughed 
end most of us were fainting and we could see 
figures getting out of our shelter. 
Maximo went to get water/ it tasted like gun 
der and smelted like the dead. We put a 
drops of listerine in it and drank one sip 
each. The shelling never stopped the whole 
night. 

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY IS, 1045 

Papa cooked some cassava and we ate it 
with sugar. Also a sip each of coffee. We didn't 
care to eat. Now there is a different kind of 
shell. It buries itself under the earth and the 
earth shakes. Maximo, the Amador's helper got 
hit by this kind of shell when he came back car- 
rying water. He was screaming with pain and 
his body was full of straight black lines and he 
was smoking, even his hair. But there was.rio 
blood on him. But he continued cooking .rice. 
Josie made some tea from avocado leaves. We 
drank it hot cause we were so thirsty. The sun 
was so hot. Near noon planes came and drop- 
ped bombs near the rotonda. We just prayed 
and prayed "Miraculous medal save us," over 
and over* again. There were shells again and no 
more lulls. Just shells and bombs and sharpnels. 
We were just waiting to die, we thought it was 
the end of the world! People ran past our 
place. One man was carrying a turkey and one 



was dragging a goat, There was an old man 
with a dying baby in his arms and Nong ran 
out to baptize the baby. We found a bottle of 
brandy and we all sipped so we'd stop , fainting. 
Then we saw sdme clothes t>f the Japanese hang- 
ing in poles and we did not know what that meant 
and we were so afraid. When the rice was cook- 
ed, We ate. The Amadors opened red pimentos 
and asparagus and even fruit cocktail. 

Then there was a lull and we saw people 
walking with their hands up. They told us that 
the Americans were on Taft ave # and the guerri- 
llas told them to go there. They told us to go 
too because this was going to be the battleground. 
We watched them but couldn't decide whether 
to follow or not. Then Nino our neighbor, came 
to tell us that Taft until Paco was liberated al- 
ready. Now we really had to go. Joseling told 
us to leave him as he cried from pain when he 
was moved. But Nino and Tony carried him in- 
to a pushcart. We put a board over the other 
pushcart loaded with things and put Chito on 
top. In the other one we put the children, We 
also brought the mattress on top of the table. 
There were many guerrillas directing the peo- 
ple. , Hiey told us to hurry up. We recognized 
many of mem from Irasan and also the , man 
selling bananas in the market. There were big 
holes in me streets and electric posts and wires 
and we had a hard time pushing the pushcarts. 

When we reached the corner of Taft and Re- 
medies we thought we saw some Japanese with 
dark green uniforms and helmets and guns. But 
they were big and as we approached they weren't 
Japanese. They were Americans! Americans! 
We were so happy f Some people ran to them 
telling them what happened. The other Ameri- 
cans were in foxholes with their machine guns 
ready. A Spanish lady ran and kissed the hand 
of one of the American soldiers. The people 
thanked them over and over again. Some people 
gave them bottles of wine. Then we came to a 
big crater and we could not let the pushcart 
through. So' we just carried the things. 

Then we went to the first aid station among 
the ruins. George and Joseling had been treat- 
ed and lay on the cement. Then I lined up car- 
rying Cila and holding Pichy. We were way 
behind the curved line and watched the people 
being treated. It was very frightening. There 
was a man with stones and clothes stuck to his 
back wounds and the doctor had a hard time 
taking out his stuck shirt and he was in so much 
pain. The doctor amputated fingers and remov- 
ed little shrapnels but not the ones way inside 
which needed an operation. The doctor ran out 
of medicines and we had to go away without 
Pichy and Cila being treated. The Philippine 
Red Cross nurse made soup for the wounded fly- 
ing among the ruins. We put Pichy in a push- 
cart and she was crying very much thinking 
about her parents who died. An American sol- 
dier cheered her up a bit. There were several 
American soldiers and they also carried their 
wounded and dead. We found the rest of the 
family in a ruined house where Madre Maria 
Sausa brought them and gave them corned beef. 
The American soldiers told us to walk cn and 
we'll be picked up by trucks. 

We walked on and waved at the trucks thai 
passed by but they only picked up those who 
were wounded. We met a friend who said Chi- 
to, Papa, Chars, Nong and Toots were headed 
fcr Malacanang. Everyone told Us to go to Ma- 
lacanang cause there were bread and apples 
there. Then we sat in front of a Panda can 
schoolhouse waiting for a truck to take us to 
Malacanang but it was getting dark so we join- 
ed the crowds going to the schoolhouse. It was 
full of refugees, so we slept under the school- 
house, We put the mattress on the ground for 
the children. I slept on top of our bundles of 
clothes so they wouldn't be stolen. We opened the 
can of corned beef but we didn't care to eat. We 
were so very tired and sleepy.

reservations, 
think that, where

avoided during the first two 
years of college life. That's 
because the college fresh- 
man and, to some extent 
the sophomore too, has 
everything to gain from 
committing himself totally 
to the new demands on his 
mind and the new social 
challenge. 

Second, bear in mind that 
college makes mental de- 
mands on a conscientious 
young man that are far 
more intensive than the 
scholastic demands of high 
school 

Therefore, unless the col- 
lege academic program is 
correspondingly reduced, 
the student H should confine 
all his work activity to the 
summer vacation period — 
avoiding part-time work 
altogether. 

As both a parent and a 
college professor, I have 
made a few observations 
with respect to young men 
working their way through 
college. 

A few youngsters are ex- 
ceptional, Wei 1-organized 
students can handle the 
challenge of both class and 
work with relative ease — 
when they want to. In fact, 
many a student learns a 
valuable lesson in this way: 
how to make time count. 

To those who ask for a 
definition of suitable work, 
here are some guidelines. 

Hours of work must fit in 
with the student's academic 
schedule and hours of study. 
He must have time for both. 
His study time must be 
equal to, and preferably 
double, his class hours. 

Physical demands should 
be such that they do not 
drain his energy for both 
books and classwork. Bear 
in mind r however, that most 
adolescents are healthy and 
strong, and aren't likely to 
do themselves harm. On 
the whole, parents tend to 
be over-concerned about 
physical strain, 

Finally, don't try to influ- 
ence the spending of the 
boy's earnings* He worked 
hard for hi s money. Let him 
spend it as he wants. 

With experience, he will 
learn how to budget him- 
self.

toiNK^KEE, III. (UPI) 
The United States is continual- 
ly in hot water — about 2.4 tril- 
liqii gallons yearly. 

It is estimated that 80 per 
cent of all water used in the 
home Is hot. The hot water fau- 
cet Is turned on 111 times a day 
in the average home. This total 
includes tub bat lis. ranging 
around 15 gallons for complete 
dunking, and about 32 ounces 
for grooming. 

Besides higher health and 
sanitation standards, the big 
Increase in hot water use dur- 
ing the last two decades arises 
from the growth of automatic 
washing machines and dish- 
washers. 

The washing machine takes 
about 25 gallons a load and 
dishwashers require 7 gallons

takes about 3 gallons, the com-

BENEVOLENCE 



I SPAT on the very first American soldier I saw that 
unspeakable day in February 1945. A few seconds 
before, lie had shouted at me from behind a tree in the 
Malate street— "Hey you! Wanna get yourself killed?" 

I crossed over from the middle of the street where 
I had been walking and I saw- that his features were 
flushed with fright a s he hunched behind tree, rifle, 
steel helmet, dusty uniform and large wooden rosary 
beads which he wore like an amulet around his neck. 
Damn you! I thought. There's nobody here but us 
Filipino civilians, and you did your best to kill us. 

I spat, but I was dry-throated and he was not aware 
of my scorn. I had not eaten or slept for more than a 
week. My husband had been tortured by Japanese 
soldiers in my presence, and then led out to be shot. 
Our home had been ransacked, put to the torch, its 
ruins shelled again and again, I had seen the head of 
the aunt who had taught me to read and write roll ,™der 
the kitchen stove, the face of a friend who had been 
crawling next to me on the pavement as we tried to 
reach the shelter under the Ermita church obliterated 
by a bullet, a legless cousin dragging himself out of 
a shallow trench in the churchyard and a young mother 
carrying a baby, plucking at my father's sleeve— "Doc- 
tor, can you help me? I think I'm wounded" — and the 
shreds of her ribs and her lungs as she turned around, 
I had heard the screams of the girls I had grown 
up with as they were dragged by Japanese soldiers 
towards the Bay view Hotel (to be raped, as we later 
fcund out) and the mindless groans of the men, tied 
together by the elbows and machinegunned by stony- 
faced Japanese. I had seen all the unforgettable, in- 
describable carnage caused by the detonation of bombs 
and land mines on the barricaded streets of Ermita and 
the carpet-shelling by the Americans which went relent- 
lessly on, long after the last Japanese sniper was a 
carcass on the rubble, I had nothing in ail the world 
except the dress on my back, an unborn child in my 
belly and in my arms, a little daughter, burning and 
whimpering with the fever of starvation. (Yes, the 
redoubtable Gemma), 

And this precious American, awaited desperately 
for the last three years, pinkcheeked and overfed, tall 
and mighty, wanted to know, his dear Americanese 
idioms rising over the crashing of the bullets and the 
shells, whether I wanted to die. 

He stared and then gave a little shrug— after twenty- 
two years I could probably still pick out his face in a 
crowd. . He resumed spraying bullets in his periphery* 
and I walked on consumed by my silent fury. 

So this was Liberation, I was no longer sure what 
was worse,, the inhumanity of the Japanese or the help- 
fulness of the Americans. It had turned out to be a ma- 
cabre sort of friendship. On the third day of February 
a family friend who lived north of the Pasig had telephon- 
ed the news. That ancient river which bisected Manila 
was to decide who was to live or die, for the Americans 
had decided to risk the whole city for the sake of the 
few American lives in Sto. Tomas, and had executed 
a sortie into the internment camp while the Japanese 
went on a rampage in the south, "The Americans are 
here," the friend had whispered just before the telephone 
lines were cut. 

Almost jubilantly, we had dug trenches in the yard 
and hid in the improvised shelters, expecting a quick 
and happy deliverance at the hands of the American 
army. But once again, as in Bataan, we had put our 
faith in the myth of the benevolent protector who did

sides had reduced Manila to the last ei 
its people to wild-eyed, shivering madrr

Yet it was in an American tent th

CONTINUED 

The recent expose of the 
fake drug racket (STM, Ap- 
ril 2) calls for our full co- 
operation. To the medical 
profession, it is of serious 
ccncern. 

This is an age of specifics. 
The medical practitioner re- 
lies more and more on the 
drug preparations made 
available to him by the 
pharmaceutical and drug 
houses. He makes a care- 
ful study of each current 
product, noting its composi- 
tion and form, action and 
uses, administration and do- 
sage, side effects, and con- 
traindications. From the 
various medications, he se- 
lects the ones, which, in his 
opinion, are most appro- 
priate for his particular ca- 
ses. Imagine his frustration 
when he learns that some of 
his choices are among those 
listed with spurious brands! 
Yes, how could the custom- 
er tell the genuine from the 
imatation? The next time 
the physician meets his pa- 
tient, he should better scru- 
tinize the drug he had pres- 
cribed. 

The combined efforts of 
the National Bureau of In- 
vestigation and the Food 
and Drug Administration 
(NBI-FDA) should be pushed 
through relentlessly if we 
expect to gain back the trust 
and confidence of the gulli- 
ble public.

In the 3rd paragraph of

that "a roll of toilet paper

a clear statement that this 
was corrected during the

was found to contain only

fulness of the Americans. It had turned out to be a ma- 
cabre sort of friendship. On the third day of February 
a family friend who lived north of the Pasig had telephon- 
ed the news That ancient river which bisected Manila 
was to decide who was to live or die, for the Americans 
had decided to risk the whole city for the sake of we 
few American lives in Sto. Tomas, and had executed 
a sortie into the internment camp while the Japanese 
went on a rampage in the south. "The Americans are 
here," the friend had whispered just before the telephone 
lines were cut. 

Almost Jubilantly, we had dug trenches in the yard 
and hid in the improvised shelters, expecting a quick 
and happy deliverance at the hands of the American 
army But once again, as in Bataan, we had put our

The recent expose of the 
fake drug racket (STM f Ap- 
ril 2) calls for our full co- 
operation. To the medical 
profession, it is of serious 
concern. 

This is an age of specifics. 
The medical practitioner re- 
lies more and more on the 
drug preparations made 
available to him by the 
pharmaceutical and drug 
houses. He makes a care- 
ful study of each current 
product, noting its composi- 
tion and form, action and 
Uses, administration and do- 
sage, side effects, and con- 
tr aind icati ons , From the 
various medications, he se- 
lects the ones, which, in his 
opinion, are most appro- 
priate for hi s particular ca- 
ses. Imagine his frustration 
when he learns that some of 
hi s choices are among those 
listed with spurious brands! 
Yes, how could the custom- 
er tell the genuine from the 
imatation? The next time 
the physician meets his pa- 
tient, he should better scru- 
tinize the drug he had pres- 
cribed. 

The combined efforts of 
the National Bureau of In- 
vestigation and the Food 
and Drug Administration 
(NBI-FDA) should be pushed 
through relentlessly if we 
expect to gain back the tcust 
and confidence of the gulli- 
ble public,

K3-LEAP from Patau island

tglas Mac Arthur was view- 
aval circles as the "most 
euver in the history of na- 
libious warfare" — for it 
ing 1,500 miles to the Phil- 
out adequate air support. 



The US 5th and 13th Air Forces had 
not enough airstrips to handle long- 
range fighters and heavy bombers 
which could fly over to this new theater 
of operations, so that MacArthur's for- 
ces had to rely solely on carrier-based 
planes. On the other hand, Japan had 
land-based aircraft in Borneo, Formo- 



sa and Hainan. 



"This dependence upon navy air support 
was a hazardous gamble that we almost lost," 
said Lt* Gen, Whitney Courtney, one of Mac 
Arthur s staff officers. 

Just as MacArthur's convoy— a fleet of 
650 battleships, aircraft carriers; cruisers, des- 
troyers, transports and landing craft — steam-

made preparations for the island's defense for 
they had anticipated, contrary to belief, the 
impending American Leyte landing. General 
Tomoyuki Yamashita, conqueror of Singapore, 
issued orders to Gen. Sosaku Suzuki, whom 
he appointed to command the Japanese 35ih 
Army in the Visayas, to defend Z#eyte at all 
cost, until such time when he f Yamashita) 
could be fully prepared for the "showdown** in 
Luzon which he thought was his trump card 
and thus turn the tables on the Americans. 

Mac-Arthur's Southwest Pacific headquar- 
ters estimated a total of 21,700 Japanese 
troops in Leyte at the moment, composing 
of one division — the 16th of the 14th Army. 

lit. Gen. Shiro Makino, commanding the 
16th, knew of the American approach to Ley- 
te as early as October 17, 1944, but ihe fcl- 
lowing day he reported to his superiors that 
his division was not dead sure if it was an 
attacking force- 
Then, early in the morning of Oct. 20 
MacArthur s Southern Task Force and North- 
ern Task Force simultaneously pounded 
for two hours the beaches lying between Tae- 
loban and Tanauan, facing the Leyte Gulf, 
from navy vessels, and afterwards air strikes, 
were launched against enemy military instal- 
lations and airfields. Before noon the X and 
XXIV Corps of the task forces were ready to 
land on the Palo-Tacloban area and Dulag 
respectively. There had been but light resist- 
ance from the Japanese. 

Landing ashore were about 225,000 Ameri- 
can soldiers— mere Americans than those that 
landed in Normandy, 

In the afternoon of the same day, Gen 
MacArthur, President Sergio Osmena, General 
Carlos P. Romulo, and others waded ashore 
the captured -beaches, and to the Filipino peo- 
ple MacArthur and Osmena delivered their 
firs speeches on Philippine soil. 

Before sundown, the X Corps had secured 
a firm hold on the area extending from the 
tip of the Cataisan Peninsula to the vicinity 
of Palo town and had seized it§ most impor- 
tant objectives: the Tacloban airstrip and Hill 
522 at Palo. Then too the XXIV Corps had 
seized Dulag airstrip and Catmon Hill, 

Enemy changes strategy 

But the war in Leyte was to last a long- 
er time— two months to be exact. When the 
Americans had overrun a considerable terri- 
tory in Leyte, Yamashita received a mes- 
sage from the Imperial Headquarters in Tok- 
yo to consolidate all the three armed forces 
of the Japanese in the Philippines and finish 
off the American landing, instead of just re- 
sort to a delaying action. Yamashita, however, 
was strongly against it, explaining to Field 
Marshall Hisaichi Terauchi that it would mean 
a waste of time, effort and men. 

But the Japanese Emperor had stamped 
his approval on such plan, and Yamashita 
could not do otherwise except to "proceed with 
it stubbornly." 

As the Americans were pushing inland, 
Japanese reinforcements arrived at Ormoc, one 
of which was the 1st Division, veteran of the 
Manehurian campaign and considered by a 
Gen. Tomochika as the best equipped division 
in the entire Japanese Army. 

But even with the appearance in the pic- 
ture of the much-needed reinforcements, the 
Americans were not deterred from making ad- 
vances, building or repairing airfields as pos- 
sible as they could, so that by late November 
Yamashita had to write Suzuki: 4 'If the con- 
struction of air bases is permitted to continue, 
the communications between the Southern 
areas and the homeland will be cut and this 
would be a serious situation. Therefore, we 
must occupy Burauen airfield as soon as pos- 
sible and at the same time neutralise TacLo- 
ban and Dulag airfields/'

the same day more than 1,000 paratroopers 
were dropped on the north and south aides of 
the San Pablo airfield. These paratroopers suc- 
ceeded in burning some planes, vehicles and a 
gasoline dump. 

It was not until Dec, 10 that the US 11th 
Airborne Division got help from the 3Bth Div- 
ision, after which the Japanese were eventual- 
ly beaten off. 

Once more the enemy launched concen- 
trated attacks on the three airfields— their 
last. For a while, it was a seesaw battle for 
both protagonists, both sustaining heavy cas- 
ualties. When however Suzuki learned that Or* 
moc had fallen into the hands of the Ameri- 
cans, he gave the' signal to forego the Bura- 
uen operations. 

The Japanese consequently wound up 
achieving no important gains. They had held 
up Mac Arthur's army for two months, it's 
true, but that did not constitute a harrier for 
his army to drive on to Manila. MacArrhur 
himself recalled that the Japanese emperor 
told him that the failure of the Japanese 
trctops to cling firmly to the so-called "Yarna- 
shita Line 1 ' in Leyte precipitated Japanese de- 
feat in the Philippines, 

Japanese troops nad been pushed farther 
westward to the sea by the unremitting ad- 
vance of the US forces, which were numerical- 
ly superior and better-equipped than the Jap- 
anese, in land, air or sea. On April 16, Su- 
zuki, who have done % all he could, perished 
when the boat that picked him up was bombed 
and sank near the coast of Negros. 

Thus ended the Leyte Campaign, 

In January 1944, there were 257,766 Am- 
erican troops in Leyte and out of this total 
th-2 US army suffered 15,500 casualties includ- 
ing 3,500 dead and nearly 12,000 wounded. To- 



mochika estimated that there were 61,800 
troops in Leyte and that 48,790 of them were 
killed in battle. 

The greatest naval war in history 

But the most momentous battle in Leyte 
was fought on sea. That naval fight between 
the two contending forces — the Battle for Ley- 
te Gulf— was described as the "greatest in the 
history of naval warfare," 

It was probably in this one naval opera- 
tion that the Japanese thought it best to stake 
all what they had to win the war; and seldom 
in history that a country had done so as Ja~ 
pan had— and yet lose virtually everything. 

However, had the results of this decisive 
battle been in favor of the Japanese, the whole 
aspect of the Pacific war would likely have 
changed, too. 

Soon after the Americans landed in Ley- 
te, Admiral Soomu Toyoda, commander-in- 
chief of the Japanese Navy, launched the new 
Japanese defense plan called "SHO-GO/* which 
called for the massing of sea and air power. 
Land-based planes would strike the first blow, 
Toyoda figured that the Americans wduld find 
themselves in a tight fix once their supply 
line was stretched and would not be sufficient- 
ly protected from the air. The nearest Ameri- 
can airfield at the time was 500 miles from 
the Philippines. On tile other hand, Japanese 
troops would be provided with ample protec- 
tion by the Japanese airlorce stationed in air- 
fields in the Philippines and which were with- 
in easy range. 

But the Japanese High Command was ig- 
norant of the destruction of their airfields and 
planes in the Philippines by sorties of US car- 
rier-based planes which started as early as 
Sept. 12, 1044. "SHCM3CT was executed whea

ing of 2 Japanese heavy cruisers and critically 
damaging another. One of the cruisers was the 
"Atago," flagship of Kurita, and the admiral 
had to be fished out of the waters for trans- 
fer to the "Yamato." 

Before long, Kurita's force was again 
sighted north of Mindoro, and planes from Hal- 
sey's fleet bombarded it mercilessly. Kurita's 
heavy cruiser, the "Myoto" was put out of 
action and the super battleship "Musahi," the 
center of the bombardment was sunk with 
1,100 men under the rain of bombs and tor- 
pedoes. 

US planes staging the initial attacks, 
eventually sighted Shima's and Nishimura's 
forces near the Sulu Sea, and accordingly noti- 
fied Kinkaid. Kinkaid came to the conclusion 
that the two forces were going to enter Suri- 
gao Strait and thus gave orders to his fleet to 
deploy between Panaon Island and the mouth 
of Surigao Strait, 

In the afternoon of the same day, search 
pilots of Halsey stumbled upon Ozawa 's North- 
ern Force steaming northwest of Luzon* 
Ozawa, doing his best to attract the 3rd Fleet, 
had divided his force into two, and it appeared 
to the pilots as two separate forces, giving, 
when evaluated, the picture of a gigantic ene- 
my naval force. Halsey hadn't the foggiest 
idea what the Japanese were up to and so 
ordered his fleet to strike at Ozawa *s force 
"with aU of our striking strength concentrated 
and leave San Bernardino Strait unguarded," 

Catastrophe at Surigao Strait 

Kinl£aid*s PT boats — 39 of them — were 
waiting at the extrme south of the Surigao 
Strait hovered two flanks of heavy and light 
cruisers and the battleship line of the six old 
battleships. 

Midnight of October 24 saw Nishimura's 
force running smack into the PT boats. But 
the battle was to get hotter yet. At 2:30 a.m. 
the next day, five US destroyers knifed down 
the Strait and fired a total of 47 torpedoes 
against the enemy. The Japanese destroyer 
"Yamagumo 11 was sunk, the battleship "Ya- 
mashiro" blew apart into halves and sank. 
Undaunted, Nishimura gave orders to "pro- 
ceed with the attack;" Then the Japanese 
"Fuso" struck by a torpedo, but it pressed on- 
ward together with the cruiser " ^^ Mogami l, and 
three remaining destroyers* 

Then the rest of the US destroyers came 
sweeping down from the west side of the 
Strait and unleased its fury, hitting the "Fuso" 
with torpedoes and sinking the destroyer 
"Mjchishio/ 1 Still, the Japanese column relent- 
lessly plodded on. 

At 3 a.m. October 25, Nishimura's force 
came within 23,000 yards of the main battle 
line of Kinkaid. US cruisers hurled volley 
after volley of shells, followed by the old 
battleships. In less than half an hour they fired 
more than 300 rounds of 14 and 16 inch ar- 
mor piercing projectiles and over 4,000 rounds 
of 6 and 8 inch projectiles. The "Fuso" fu- 
riously fired back, but being subjected to the 
curtain of hellish firing, could not stand long, 
began to quiver, then listed and sank. 

Kinkald's 7tii Fleet virtually destroyed 
Nishimura's force. Nishimura himself went 



down with his flagship, the "Yamashiro." 
Only the destroyer "Shigure" survived the in- 
credible barrage of cannon balls and torpedo 
blasts. The 7th Fleet sustained only tine casul- 
ty, the destroyer "Albert W. Grant," which 
could not escape on time and was hit 19 
times by both friend and foe alike. 




Trooper of 11th Airborne Division views Manila burning 
from Paranaque where the 11th was piimed down. 

Seeing the debacle ahead, Shima's force 
wriggled out of the clutch of snarling PT 
boats, its breath coming in great pants and 
edged its way back down the Strait retracing 
its course in the company of the "Mogami," 
which was badly damaged, and the "Shigure/* 
At the crack of dawn, American planes hove 
into view, saw the limping "Mogami," and 
bombed it until it sank. Shima withdrew from 
the attack, with a few vessels left at his com- 
mand. 

But as the US navy was gaining the up- 
perhand. it received the terrifying report that 
Kurita had returned and was now off the 
western coast of Samar, having penetrated the 
San Bernardino Strait. He was stalking Kin- 
kaid's northernmost force. Kinkaid was in 
grave peril. Bewildered, Kinkaid knew that 
Halsey v s fleet would be unable to respond tt> 
his calls for help for several hours. And very 
much in his mind also was the grim possibil- 
ity that, given the chance, Shima might come 
back to Surigao Strait, and so he could not 
well leave the Straits unguarded. This was the 
major question hanging over his head. 

Kinkaid finally decided to split his forces 
into two. Meanwhile, Ozawa 's mission to trick 
Halsey into a fight was a complete success, 
beyond the wildest dreams of the Japanese. 
Ozawa, however, committed a grievous mis- 
take by not notifying Kurita of the success of 
his decoy mission, which would have probably 
spelled the difference between defeat and vic- 
tory for the Japanese navy. 

Kurita's fleet, now reduced to 4 battle- 
ships, 6 heavy cruisers, 2 light cruisers and 11 
destroyers, proceeded down Samar coast, in 
the morning of Oct. 25. Then Kurita sighted 
a group of the 7th Fleet and took this to be 
Halsey's fleet composed of large aircraft car-

THE 

FANATICAL 

DEFENSE 

OF 

MANILA 

AT 6:35 P.M., FEBRUARY 3, 1945, 
the flying columns of the 1st Ca- 
valry crossed the boundary of Manila 
past the Balintawak monument. 

By this time it became clear that General 
Yamashita had not planned to defend either 
Manila or Central Luzon and yet the Japanese 
defense of Manila was fanatic. 

Why 7 General Yamashita had intended to 
lose Manila by default, along with the Central 
Plains after he had decided in December 1944 to 
pull the bulk of his forces to the Mt. Province 
and set up headquarters in Bagulo. Twice Gen- 
eral Yamashita ordered the Japanese navy to 
evacuate Manila. But twice the Japanese navy 
countermanded his orders {testimony of Yama- 
shita at his trial which some American writers 
seemed to confirm). 

So as the Japanese army moved out oi Ma- 
nila marines under the Japanese navy moved in.

THE BATTLE OVER 
SOUTHERN MANILA, 1945 

By RODOLFO Y. RAGODON «s^^ 





To a man of Admiral 
Iwabachi's kidney, surrender 
was out of the question 





American GI and Filipino guerrilla seem oblivious 
to slain Japanese soldier, with brains blown 

out, in front of Santo Tomas University gale. 



During the second half of December Vice 
Admiral Deshichi Okuchi prepared the defense 
of Manila and placed the separate naval defense 
under the command of Rear Admiral Sanji Iwa- 
baehi. The defense force, 16,000 strong, was 
placed under General Yokoyama of the Shimbu 
army group but Admiral Okuchi p insisting that 
Manila should be defended to the bitter end, 
would obey no orders from the army to do other- 
wise. To save face, Yokoyama t with only 3,750 
army troops, transfered the command to the fa- 
natical Iwabachi. 

On February 15, Yamashita censured Yoko- 
yama for surrendering his command to Iwaba- 
chi and ordered him to withdraw from Manila 
immediately. But by February 17 ( despite the 
fact that he was informed of this order and be- 
cause Krueger's Sixth Army had cut off all with- 
drawal routes, Admiral Iwabachi decided to de- 
fend Manila to the last Japanese marine. 

At dusk on February 3. Filipino scouts (one 
of them was Manuel Colayco) led the 1st Caval- 
ry and attached units to UST. But on the way, 
at the Chinese cemetery, the Japanese opened 
fire from among the tombstones in the graveyard 
and a. running battle ensued. 

The 1st Cavalry moved on anyway to UST 
where the Americans were interned. In the 
meantime, troops of the 8th Cavalry were de- 
tached from the column and sent to Malacanang 
and the Legislative building south of the Pasig- 

The course of the Legislative building lay at 
Quezon boulevard toward Quezon bridge, A s the

ry 5, Col. Brady and his men es- 
panese to a point approximately 



one mile from UST where the Japanese were re- 
leased. 

On February 7 t General MacArthur made 
his dramatic return to Manila. MacArthur rode 
through the* city amidst cheers from the Fili- 
pinos, 

Even at this moment, the 37th Division, which 
fought its way to Manila on February 4 T engaged 
the Japanese marines in a fire fight along the 
Fasig River. 

When the Japanese dug in t the American 
artillery went into action. The Japanese too were 
lobbing artillery shellfire from the south. 

Fighting was bitter as it progressed. There 
was street fighting along the Espana, Quezon 
boulevard route, and Escolta, 

The 8th Engineers finally installed a pontoon 
bridge at Nagtahan for the cavalrymen. The 
Japanese spotted it and tried to demolish it with 
artillery fire* But the cavalrymen were able to 
cross and savage fighting broke out in Paco and 
Ermita, The 8th Cavalry moved forward in 
Paco. 

The battle of Manila later resolved itself in- 
to the compression of the Japanese marines into 
the Luneta-PGH-Port area-Intramuros area. The 
37th Division applied pressure on this area from 
the north and east. The 1st Cavalry drove in 
from the south and the 12th Cavalry drove to- 
wards Port area and Manila Hotel. 

Every building and every wail became a 
Japanese strong point. Open spaces were mined 



and barricaded and protected with Japanese 
anti-tank guns and automatic (machine rifle) 
guns. 

The Japanese conducted a night attack in 
the vicinity of Fort Abad against the 12th Ca- 
valry and fought fiercely to retain their posi- 
tion at De la Salle College on Taft avenue. Japa- 
nese marines held on stubbornly to the perimeter 
around the Philippine General Hospital. 

One of the most vicious fightings took place 
at the Rizal baseball and football stadiums, Jhe 
assaulting force was the 1st Cavalry. The 11th 
Airborne Division was pinned down at Faraiia- 
que. 

By February 16, the section of Manila in 
the hands of the Japanese marines became 
smaller and the 37th Division took over opera- 
tional command of the shrinking street-to-street, 
house-to-house, room-to-room (and in the case 
of the Manila Hotel, landing- to- landing) battle. 

For two long weeks, the advancing troops 
shelled, shot, grenaded, bombarded, burned and 
fought their way through the rubble that was 
once a beautiful city. 

On February 16, 500 Japanese marines, with 
artillery support, counterattacked. It turned 
out to be the last one. The Japanese were pushed 
back and cornered in Intramuros, It was there 
the last of them perished or surrendered. 

By March 3, all vestiges of organized re- 
sistance in Manila were overcome.

rating north and northwest of Bessang Pass. 
But three days later, Japanese artillery atop 
Mount TSuccuai opened up and pinned down the 
Filipino advance units. Reinforcements for both 
sides (from Butac for the Filipinos and from 
Bontoc-Mankayan for the Japanese) poured in 
and for some time the battle was a stalemate. 

Japanese 'sneak 1 attack 

In May, General Ozaki decided cn a 
bold plan to end the fight once and for all, Bu- 
tac, a small town west of the Pass along High- 
way 4, was known to be the Filipinos* main 
supply line. The Japanese general's scheme was 
to cut off the supply with a surprise attack on 
Butac, To do this, Ozaki sent one battalion to 
skirt Bessang by moving down south and reach 
Aiilem, a small town about 15 kilometers south- 
west of Butac. From Aiilem, the Japanese 
launche d a ferocious attack. A detachment of 
the USAFIP's 14th Infantry, failing to beat the 
enemy to Alilern f struck, at the enemy's rear 
even as another battalion of the 121st moved in 
from the front to squeeze out the raiders. 

Failure of the Japanese commandos to cut 
eff supply lines of the USAFIP made much of 
the difference between victory and defeat. To- 
ward the end of May, the Filipino soldiers were 
piling heavy 81-MM mortar shells on secured 
ridges dotting one side of the Cervantes road, 
By this time, too, the full force of 66th Infantry 
which had been operating in Mt. Province, the 
14th Infantry which had helped the 37th Division 
of the Sixth Army under Gen, Walter Krueger in 
securing Cagayan Valley, and the 11th Infantry 
had joined with the 121st and the 15th for the 
final push to Bessang. Incidentally, it was the 
121st which had been spearheading the drive 
against the Japanese since the Occupation. All 
together, the USAFIP, NL was composed most- 
Iv of Bataan and Corrcgidor veterans. To them. 



therefore, the capture of Bessang Pass would be 
sweet revenge. 

The capitulation 

A unique feature of the Bessang campaign 
was the attachment of two American units tp 
the USAFIP, NL. First week of June, General 
Krueger ordered the 122nd Field Artillery Bat- 
talion and the First Battalion of the 123rd Infan- 
try, W I" Corps, Sixth Army to assist in the bjg 
push up to the Pass, For the first time in Phil- 
ippine military history American units were 
"under the command of Filipino officers.** The 
set-up was only logical because the Filipinos 
knew the terrain like they did the inside of their 
palms. 

On June 10, hell really broke loose on Bes- 
sang. The USAFIP poured everything they had. 
One by one enemy strongholds felf. But just as 
the stubborn, the strategic Mount Buccual was 
within reach, the Japanese braced themselves 
up for one mighty counterattack. The. result 
was heavy casualties on bom sides. 

(At the end of the North Luzon campaign 
Japanese death toil was placed at 52,000 and 
32,000 captured; USAFIP^ NL casualties were 
listed as 1,441 killed in Action, 3,475 wounded in 
action, and 84 missing in action for a total of 
5,000.) 

But superior firepower from the USAFIP side 
could not be stopped. In the early hours of June 
14, two companies of the 121st stabbed into the 
heart of the Bessang area and routed the remain- 
ing Japanese defenders. So, after six months 
which saw some of the bloodiest fightings in the 
liberation campaign, the way to Yamashita's lair 
was open. 

ftow, with the Filipino-American forces 
moving in from either side of the Mt. Province, 
the fate of Yamashita was sealed.

conquest in 1942 and their subsequent occupation 
of almost three years. 

A United States congressional report stated: 
"Official reports, photographic evidence, and

destruction are unanimous in asserting that, of 
all the war-ravaged areas of the world, the 
Philippines are the most utterly devastated from

Ijet me illustrate: Hungry as Victor Hugo's Jean 
Val Jean, and partly to show off his daring, Pepe 
one boring afternoon stole the pet' goose cf some- 
body near the neighborhood. Pepe should have 
stolen a chicken instead. To his utter dismay, 
the goose tucked under his arm made more 
noise than a hospital ambulance's siren. The 
whole neighborhood was aroused, Pepe ran fast- 
er than the wind and avoided identification. 

But what I picture clearly now is Pepe on 
his knees, in one the the yard s between the 
wards of the Philippine General Hospital, fran- 
tically blowing the fire to life. The can of kang- 
kong was propped up by stones. It was February, 
1945, and Manila south of the Pasig had been 
put to the torch by the Japanese and was now 
under seige by American artillery. 

Street fighting was savage. Manila was hell. 
Compared to it, Dante's inferno would have 
seemed like a week-end holiday in Hong Kcng, 
I remember how Pepe, gaunt and a bit dazed, 
but without mischief ncw t get up and locked at 
me resting on the railing of the hospital corri- 
dor. He managed a brave smile. Then he an- 
nounced he was having boiled kangkong for din- 
ner. 

I can still see him bow — twenty two years 
ago, but as fresh and real as now. 

The massacre of Manila 

Those who witnessed the fanatical battle of 
southern Manila can recall their personal ex- 
periences only with great agitation. 

There was the newly-wed girl, seven months 
pregnant, who was held by the Japanese marines 
in California st. while they tortured Her husband 
and finally shot him— right before her eyes. She 
has not yet quite gotten over this trauma. 

Then there were the families who were herd- 
ed into the' Price residence at the corner of 
California and Colorado streets and then mass- 
acred, Only a few survived miraculously. But 
to this day they still imagine the blood smeared 
ail over their clothes. 

Similar scenes took place in Intramuros, 

All these flashbacks have been retained by 
the mind. 

There are sounds to be remembered too. 

I remember mcst the sound of a Japanese 
bullet whizzing past by me one day before Ma- 
nila went up in smoke. The 1st cavalry was with- 
in shooting distance of Manila but hardly any- 
body in the south expected hell to break loose 
so suddenly and so violently. 

The bullet was fired by a Japanese sniper 
from our neighbor's dormitory at the back of our 
house. It passed between me and my ecu sin Jim- 
my as we descended the back steps to feed our 
precious pig in the backyard. 

It missed both of us but it found another 
target: the ccmely middle-aged lady who rented 
our first floor. Fortunately for her life, but un- 
fortunately for her ego, the bullet landed in — 
pardon us— the lady* s hip. You see, she was in 
a bending position, washing her face, when the

diet struck her. She quickly stood up and 
t out a scream that led us to discover thai 
ie was a coloratura soprano. 

But the next scene I remember wa s rather 
jering. Two Japanese marines were crawling 
e snakes in the grass in the backyard of an- 
icr neighbor on Pennsylvania street. They 
re dragging along a drum of gasoline. I won- 
red what they were up to until they spilled 
! gasoline on the house and set it on fire. 

This was the night the Japanese marines put 
ithern Manila to the torch. 

When dawn broke, our neighborhood in Er- 
ta was in chaos. The panicked male borders 
the YMCA at the corner of Pennsylvania and 
agon were scaling the wall of the Lichauco 
ne trying to flee the guns of the Japanese ma- 
es who were thirsty for blood. 

When I turned to look at the left at the front 
our house, a stout Japanese marine with a 
ize mask was aiming his pistol at me, For- 
ately again, one aims a pistol by bringing it 
vn slowly from a high position. In a split 
ond, I had turned about and made a record 
;h back to the house, Three years later, I 
s easily chosen to join our college track and 
d team. 

PGR made into a fortress 

Shortly after the flying columns of the 1st 
'airy stormed into Manila (February 3 and 4), 
families in our neighborhood were inching 
r way towards the Philippine General Hos- 
I. My cousin Jimmy was luckily versed in 
akana and was able to convince a Japanese 
lier that all we wanted was to seek refuge at 
PGH. At that precise moment in that parti- 
\r neighborhood, other. Japanese marines 
e slaughtering all Filipino males within 
it 

Thus it was short of a miracle that the sol- 
escorted us across Taft avenue. When we 
rsed Taft avenue, a whole line of suicidal 
ines of the Japanese navy menacingly stood 
pointing their ugly guns at us. One out of 
*y three was armed with a machine gun (it 
called machine rifle, with the magazine 
led down frcm up). 

Before we crossed, unknown to most of us, 
most beautiful girl in the neighborhood, Ce- 
was hit in the leg by sniper fire and was 
* prostrate on the street until the advancing 
uioan 37th division discovered and rescued 

But as for us, when we crossed Taft avenue, 
had no idea whether the Japanese marines 
(d decide to test their guns cn us or not. 
they so decided, we would have been just 
emory now. 

Wter we crossed, I saw a Japanese officer 
his sumarai sword reverently t point it vi- 
usly in the direction of the Americans across 
avenue and swear violently in guttural kan- 
I am sure that Japanese perished in the bat- 
He didn't sound like he was going to surren- 
at alt 

But I remember somebody in the group had 
d water for the children from the Japanese 
ers. One brushed her aside but another 
ed water in her cup from his canteen and 

gave the others as well. He was the only 
(eman in his detachment, 
tfe finally sought refuge in Ward ll t the pe- 
*ic ward of my father: I shall always re- 
iber rather sentimentally this ward and the 
[ as an impregnable fortress. The fantas- 
ly thick walls of the FGH saved our lives. 
When the Americans started to bombard the 
[ with 155 mm, and 240 mm. howitzers, 16,- 
-efugees from Ermita and Malate (my fath- 

estimate), crammed into the PGH, This 
1 be an accurate estimate. I remember, as 
bombardment reached its greatest intensity, 
y people moved into the "basement" (under 
first floor). 



240 mm. howitzers of the Americans 

For about two weeks, the PGH withstood 
the fiercest barrage of American artillery direct- 
ed by piper cubs overhead. Why this barrage 
continued for two weeks when PGH was packed 
with Filipino refugees, I have not been able to 
fully understand to this day. Surely, they must 
have known, at least from the piper cubs over- 
head and from the 37th Division frontline men 
that there was only a handful of Japanese at 
the PGH. The only Japanese I remember were 
the few who dressed as doctors and ordered the 
men to put out the fire wherever it started. The 
rest were outside the PGH along Taft avenue, 

I can hear it now — the crushing, grinding, 
tearing sound of artillery shells exploding into 
a mass of concrete or on the hospital grounds. 

- The howitzer shells were preceded by eerie 
whistling sounds. Every time there was a bar-

real money, it might have been different. 
Sherman tank climbs the front steps 

For nearly two weeks, fighting around the 
PGH was furious and una bating. On occasion, 
we could see Japanese hurl grenades in what is 
now the National Science Development Board 
compound. One day, somebody told us that a 
Sherman tank had climbed the front steps of the 
PGH but was thrown back by an anti-tank gun 
of the Japanese* For one week, troops of the 
37th Division tried to cross Taft avenue in front 
of PGH but were repeatedly repulsed. 

One day about February 16 or 17 there was 
hysterical shouting in the next ward, Ward 
where some American patients were being treat- 
ed. 

It was the first ward liberated by the Am- 
erican GIs, The battle, at least for us, was over.

rage, the whole ward went into fervent prayer. 
I can still hear it now — the long murmur of 
fright. 

The casualties were heavy. I remember 
young: surgeons lite Dr. Victor Reyes, operating 
on the casualties 20 hours a day. I remember 
Dr. Reyes because I held the plasma for a young 
boy I picked up in the corridor and brought to 
the operating room. I remember this because 
after staring at the pool of blood for hours, I 
felt faint and asked a nurse to hold the plasma. 

My own father was nearly hit by sharpnel 
and until the day he retired he asked the car- 
penters to preserve the damage at the ward 
door where the sharpnel lodged. 

While the artillery barrage continued with- 
out let up, food and water became scarce. One 
meal for each member in our family consisted 
of three spoons of lugaev Later f I remember, I 
had one glorious calcium pill for dinner. 

Water now had to be fetched from the ar- 
tesian well at the hospital grounds at the south 
wing. My cousin Jimmy and I fetched water in 
demijohns. But this chore became perilous when 
the barrage started. I remember one after- 
neon the barrage caught us while we were still 
on our way back. A sharpnel hit the demijohn 
which my cousin Jimmy had firmly over his 
head. The demijohn burst and the water bathed 
my cousin while his hands were still over his 
shoulders as if he was surrendering. Gcod thing 
for my cousin Jimmy— he hadn't taken a bath 
in weeks. 

After this barrage one family offered us one 
bayong of money if we fetched one demijohnful 
of water for it. We just smiled politely with- 
out even bothering to answer. The offer was 
ridiculous — the family offered to pay Japanese 
"Mickey Mouse" money. Now if they had offered 



The Japanese retreated into Intramuros. 

As we walked out of the PGH carrying our 
sackful of belongings I looked at my father and 
mother. They had aged. And so had all of us 
at PGH. 



A devastated city 

Manila, south of the Pasig T had either been 
razed to the ground by the Japanese marines or 
blown into shreds by American artillery. Our 
house was gone and like many of the people in 
the south, it was from then on a story of riches- 
to-rags. 

Manila, as Mac Arthur called it, became the 
"Warsaw of Asia,** the most devastated city in 
this part of the world. 

With this in mind we might have expected 
more understanding from those who coerced the 
Filipinos into accepting the "parity'* provision 
in our Constitution in exchange for the payment 
by the U.S. government of war damages. Per- 
haps there was understanding — but absolutely no 
sympathy. 

. And who is this Professor David Reagan who 
makes light of the fact that parity was forced 
upon us? He would like us to believe now that 
we welcomed parity with open arms. We are 
afraid the professor needs a new pair of glasses: 
it is not open arms we have but arms that have 
been twisted. 

We now look back at the Japanese attroci- 
ties committed during the war, But when are 
we going to look back at the postwar atrocities 
like parity and the attempts to retain the Philip- 
pines as an economic colony of the United 
States?

One cannot help but won- 
der what causes ail these 
social cancers in our midst 
at present. And one feels/ 
helpless when he begins H 
realize that the situation 
seems incorrigible. 

The most that one can do , 
is ask questions for starting 
a one-person crusade is * 
downright disaster. For m 
tance, we ask: What are our 
police authorities doi 
about extortionists, pi 
and boys for sale Icitei 
from dusk to dawn aroi 
the Qulapo vicinity who do 
nothing but molest people 
waiting for rides home? Andi 
to think that they do their 
trade right under the very 
noses of policemen; the p> 
lice outposts are just a Jet 
yards away and most boys 
knew the policemen on tie' 
beat. And who will proted 1 
the riding public when 
ney drivers begin chargiM 
P,20 for the usual P.10 xik\ 
simply because there art 
few jeepneys plying the 
routes at cne or two o'clod

a lot of questions to ask 
about the state of things at
