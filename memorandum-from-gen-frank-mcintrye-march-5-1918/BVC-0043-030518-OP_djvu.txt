MEMORANDUM for General Frank M. McIntyre, 

Chief of the Insular Bureau. 


Referring to your raenorandum of March 2, with 
reference to the issuance of a commission to a Filipino 
in the Medical Reserve Corps, the Surgeon General directs 
me to advise you that the law specifically provides that 
such commissions may only he issued to citizens of the 
United States. 

It would seem that a commission has been issued 
in error to Doctor Pedro Apacible and this office is now 
endeavoring to adjust this matter in some way not pre~ 
judicial to his interests. 

As soon as the questions involved in this matter 
have been definitely decided we shall be glad to advise 
you further regarding it. 



ALL COMMUNICATIONS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO "THE SURGEON GENERAL, U, S. ARMY. WASHINGTON. D. C.‚Äù
