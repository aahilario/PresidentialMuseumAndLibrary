VICTORY FOR MANKIND 

In the decisive months which followed victory in the last 
war» all those peoples who turned their backs on world respon- 
sibilities, and Americans were one of them, helped lay the 
groundwork for today's butchery. 

Today, the United States, through the action of its Senate 
Saturday, has laid the groundwork for tomorrow's enduring 
peace, as the first major country to approve the United 
Nations world charter. 

In the intervening 27 years, the world has learned the folly 
of isolation, of erecting barriers between nations, of ignoring 
wrongs committed against neighbors. Americans, as well as 
British, Russians, Chinese, Czechs, French, and all the others, 
have learned that it avails nothing to withdraw into a shell of 
indifference, pull the covers over one's head, and pretend "it 
could never happen here," 

Peoples who love peace have found that it takes more than 
love to maintain peace. They have learned that when organ- 
ized Fascism stalks the world, only organized democracy can 
erase it. 

To all those who have faith in a better world, the action 
of the United States Senate, boldly inscribing on history's pages 
that America has unequivocally abandoned traditional isola- 
tionism and taken her place among the brotherhood of nations, 
comes as a victory for mankind. 

And it is just that the only major nation which failed to ap- 
prove the League of Nations in 1918, should become the first 
to approve the United Nations in 1945.

tion is accepting its interna- 
tional responsibility in a new

Rep. Sol Bloom: "We have 
today made a long step forward 
toward world peace and se-

'*wiJl not seriously interfere with Allied l^indings on the 
Japanese home ialands."

U.S* Occupation 
Not ^Temporary^ 

BERLIN — American soldiers 
in Europe occupation duties 
will be returned to the United 
States as "conditions warrant" 
but transfers will not be so 
quick as to jeopardize peace, 
President Truman said yester- 
day. 

In an interview with the 
Army newspaper Stars and 
StripeSf Truman said 'Occupa- 
tion of Europe was not tempo- 
rary, and problems of soldiers 
and separated families can be 
solved by getting soldiers back 
home soon as possible. 

Returning servicemen who 
want work should have "no 
serious troubles." Truman said, 
explaining employers wanted to 
cooperate in rehiring veterans*

Gen, George C, Kenney, 
command ill g general of Far 
East Air Forces, speaking 
over an Army Hour broad- 
cast to the United States 
Sunday, declared the "air 
battle of Japan has begun." 

In a talk commemorating 
Army Air Force Day, August

casion last year I spoke from 
my headquarters In Brisbane. 
Today, headquarters of Far 
East Air Forces is operating in

erful air force in history is be- 
ing assembled- 

"Airplanes under FEAF con- 
trol which today are attackinjj

number ovef 6,000. Since last 
August, those air forces have 
sunk or damaged 3,000,000 tons

Her forces wiU be immobilized. 
At that time, our tactical mis* 
sion begins, and the full pow-

nish direct support to General 
Mac Arthur's troops* 

"Every enemy gun will be 
taken out, every enemy con- 
centration will be bombed and 
strafed, every enemy movement 
smothered. In the meantime,

tive Japanese reinforcements of

Leaflets soon will rain on 
Japan, warning civilians that 
fheir home cities will be sub- 
jected to large-scale air raids

ters has announced. 

Leaflets will be dropped by 
planes of Gen. George 
Kenney*s Far East Air Forces. 

Lt. CoL J. W, Greene, exe- 
cutive officer of FWB, said: 
*'The ncw^ warnini^ program 
is part of the truth campaiffn 
started by the branch some- 



time aj;^o, which has produced 
excelhnt results. Further- 
more, the appearance of the 
leaflets, followed by a raid 
in force, in each case with 
clock-like regularity, will de- 
monstrate to the people of 
Japan that their army and 
navy Air Forces are impo- 
tent to stop us, even when 
they know exactly when and 
where we arc coming." 

The leaflet shows a white 
bomb-burst on a red and 
black backjjround. The cen- 
ter of the burst states: "This 
city is the next target of the 



United States Army Air 
Forces." , ^ 

On the reverse side of the

Ine Japanese that doom is 
coming in 72 hours. 

The Japanese are warned: 
**As you can see, your mili- 
tary force is powerless to

Japanese arc advised to turn 
away from the militarists and 
endeavor to save what is left

cuate the city at once," 



No Relief in U*S. 
Food Shortage Seen 

WASHINGTON— 'No significant relief from 
shortages of civilian supplies is in prospect for the next 
12 months/' the U. S. Department of Agriculture told 
the people of the United States Sunday. 

"The total food production in 1945 may be three to 
four percent below 1944/^ the report said. 



Production of food from live- 
stock ^^ill be smaller, but pro- 
duction of food crops will be 
about the same as in 1944. 
Such foods as meat.^, fats, oils, 
sugar, milk products, poultry, 
eggs, canned fruits, and veget- 
ables will not be adequate to 
meet the demands. However 
the supplies of other foods will 
£:uffice to maint4iin a general 
level of nutrition for civilians, 
the report disclosed. 

The basic food problem of 
the U.S. m 1045 is ont of dis- 
tribution "to meet the over-all 
civilian, military and export 
demand which is approximately 
one-half jp-oater than the pre- 
war d*^mand," the report said. 

The report said the food sup- 
ply of the U.S. in 1945 will be 
distributed about as follows-: 

Seventy-seven percent to 
United States civilians, 17 per- 
cent to armed forces?, including 
relief feeding by military, 4 to 
S percent purchased by the De- 
partment of Agriculture for 
shipment abroad under lend- 
lease and ,qivili3n lelief, and 
more than 2 percent for commer- 
cial exports and shipments. 



In 1944, about 13 percent of 
food went to our armed forces, 
7 percent was exported, and 
civilians consumed 80 percent. 

Prospective food supplies for 
civilians in 1045 indicated 
consumption per person would 
average 5 percent below 1944.

In the hour-lonir bombard-

FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY 

As the Philippines approaches her national goal of inde- 
pendence, nobody is more sincerely missed than Manuel Luis 
Quezon, who died a year ago away from his native land. No 
man has done more to unify his people and to prepare them 
for their destiny as an independent nation than the late Pres- 
ident of the Philippines. No more apt title has been given him 
than that of Father of this country. 

Manuel Quezon died only 80 days before the American 
landing on Ley+e, an event to which he had looked forward with 
marvelous courage and boundless faith. As many other world 
heroes before him, the man who personified in the free world 
Filipino resistance against Japanese aggression was denied by 
death the supreme fruit of his labors and deeds. 

Save for this poignant fact, bereaved Filipinos took con- 
solation in the knowledge that Manuel Quezon had lived a long 
and fruitful life in the service of his country. He was born early 
enough to dutifully take his post' in the revolutionary army 
against Spanish tyranny, thus doing his part in paving the way 
for the realization of the dream of his boyhood hero, Jose RizaT. 
With the same purpose in his mind, the establishment of an in 
dependent Philippine republic, he fought the American forces 
until he was convinced that the American objective in the oc 
cupation of the Philippines was to prepare the Filipinos for 
self-government. He took the oath of allegiance to the Amer- 
ican -flag; he kept that oath until his death. 

Endowed with a brilliant mind and a magnetic personality, 
Manuel Quezon steadily rose in political prestige and in the 
affection of his people. In turn he used the power and in- 
fluence he gained in the promotion of the welfare of the Fili- 
pino people and toward the realization of their national in- 
dependence. He became so well known throughout the world 
for his accomplishments as nationalist leader that his qualities 
and achievements as a public servant were overshadowed. 

Manuel Quezon will not be here when the Philippines as- 
sumes her proud place among the free and Independent nations 
of the world. But his spirit will continue to guide the Philip- 
pines so long as there is a Filipino nation. No man has left 
a stronger imprint of his will, determination and personality 
upon the Philippines than the man who died a year ago.

Last of Flying 
Forts Delivered 

LOS ANGELES— The last of 
the B-17 Flying Fortresses was 
inspected here Monday and was 
delivered to the U. S. govern- 
ment yesterday. 
The Army recently decided to 
end production of B-17's. Em- 
phasis is now on the B-29*s, 
which are hitting Japan with 
devastating effect. 

Lockheed, Boeing and Douglas 
aircraft plants have turned out 
12,731 Flying Fortresses since 
production was begun in July, 
1941. 

Flying Fortresses played a 
big role in the defeat of Ger- 
many and have been used in 
various sectors of the Pacific 
theater.

Guerrilla Units 

Secretary of National Defense 
Alfredo Montelibano Saturday 
night assured deserving guerri-

Addressing a banquet given 
in his honor by the Nakar Divi- 
sion, Montelibano said recogni- 
tion and processing of guerri- 
llas was under the jurisdiction 
of the United States Army. Ir- 
regular troops come under the 
control and administration of 
the PA only after they are pro- 
cessed and inducted.

7 German Civilians to Hang 
For Murders of Yank Airmen 

DARMSTADT, GERMANY— In the first mass trial 
of war criminals in the American zone of occupation, a 
United States Seventh Army military commission or- 
dered seven Germans hanged, three condemned to life 
imprisonment, and one acquitted on charges of bru- 
tally murdering six American airmen shot down over 
Germany. 

Two women — Margaret Witzler and Kathe Rein- 
hardt — were among the seven ordered to be hanged, as 
well as Josef Hartgen and Friederick Wuest, who had 
attempted to commit suicide. 



The murders of which the 11 
were accused took place near 
Darnastadt in August, 1944, 
when U. S. prisoners of war 
were paraded through the 
streets of a town, in violation of 
the Geneva convention, the 
morning after it had been heav- 
ily bombed by the Royal Air 
Force. , 

The Americans, participating 
in the attack on Osnabreuck, 
had been 'shot down and were 
on their way to the prison camp, 



led through the streets by a 
German sergeant. 

They were beaten to death 
with clubs, brick bats and pieces 
of pipe by infuriated towns- 
people of the town. At least 
two of the Americans were shot. 

Wuest, a self-confessed Nazi, 
admitted taking part in attack- 
ing the airmen. The slight fac- 
tory worker calmly told the 
court he tried his best to beat 
one of the men with a hammer,

QUEZON AND HiS HKIENDS 

A tnbuie to the keen vision of Manuel Quezon, whose deafh 
anniversary was observed by his people yesterday* was the 
creation of the Philippfne Arnrjy, This same Army made a heroic 
stand in 1942 on Bataan that won tti© plaudit and gratitude 
of free peoples everywhere. Even before he was maugurdted 
as President in 1935, Quezon bad already made the arrange^ 
ments to bring back his old friend General Douglas MacArthur 
to the Philippines to organize that Army, Strong cooperation 
between President Quezon and General MacArtbur overcame 
all difficulties that confronted the organization and training of 
the Philippine Army, which was not supposed to reach its full 
strength until 1946. 

Also a tr-bute to the perspicacity of Manuel Quezon was 
hrs personal choice of General MacArthur to build up the na- 
tional defense of the Philippines, Ho had confidence In Gen- 
eral MacArthur and loyalty gave him full support when in some 
political quarters there arose doubt about the necessity of or- 
ganizing even a small army. Prestdenf Quezon later could point 
with pride, If he wanted to, that General MacArthur was here 
on the spot to lead American and Filipino forces when Japan 
attacked. 

Yesterday also completed the first year of Sergio Osmefia 
as President of the Philippines, As the Filipino people had ex- 
pected and provided for, he succeeded President Quezon. The 
two Filipino loaders had worked closely for four decades in be- 
half of Phil ippfne independence, and Mr, Osmena was President 
Quezon's choice as his successor. 

General MacArthur has called Presidenf Osmena "the 
worthy successor" to the great Manuel Quezon. Upon taking 
his oath of office a year ago yesterday, President Osmena ex- 
pressed the determination to carry on where President Quezon 
left off in the fight to liberate the Philippines from the Jap- 
anese and to establish a truly mdependent Philippine republic. 
He also oitpressed his dotcrmlnation t'^ promote close relation- 
ship between the Philippines and the United States, 

Until the FHiprno people elect a successor, Sergio Osmena 
will remain President. As such he deserves all the loyal support 
that the Filipino people gave Manuel Quezon. In the prosecu- 
tion of ttie war against Japan and In the reconstruction and re- 
habilitation of the Philippines, President Osmena needs that sup- 
r :?rt which every patriotic Filipino must give the leader of his

Truman Praises 
Senate Decision 
On UK Charter 

WASHINGTON — President 
Truman said yesterday that the 
ratification ol: the United Na-

Senate "is not so much an end 
as a beginning." 

"It remains now for the peo- 
ple of the United States to see 
to it that the charter works, 
insofar as it is within their 
powers to make it work," 
Truman declared in a message 
to Clark M. Eichelberger, di- 
rector of the American Assecia- 
tion for United Nations. 

*'The Senate has done its 
work and done it wisely, 
promptly and with courage, 

**Only if the people of the 
world understand what the 
charter is, and what it can 
mean to the peace of the woiidj 
will the document' become a 
living reality, 

**We must all hope the peo- 
ples of this country and the 
peoples of the rest of the Unit- 
ed Nations will inform them- 
selves of the possibilities which 
the charter opens." 



The order will apply exclu-^ 
siveiy to small, light industries 
since a great majority of the 
larg-er plants were stripped of 
machinery by ■ the Russian

The problem of waste dis-

did not have a sewage system 
and disposed of their feces by 
paiis. Public midden sheds 
constructed by the city govern- 
ment before the war disap- 
peared during the Japanese re- 
gime and thi;? third of the city 
population were thrpwing their 
night soil on the streetsideg and 
in other vacant places. 

The health department then 
started a midden shed construe- 
tion program intended to re- 
place all the latrines of the pre- 
war period. It ordered 10,000 
pails and began the construc- 
tion of the sheds. Shortage of 
building materials, however, 

came an obstacle and the de- 
partment was able to erect only 
more than 200 latrines and 
provide them with the neces- 
sary pail-?. 

As it carried on its intensive 
program of health and sanita-

OSMENA LAUDS QUfZON'S RECORD 

. iTT^: ITHai/s Wisdom of Transfer of 

U.S. in 1942 



K^me/s Planes Write Air Force 2:t„„,„, 
Day Tribute in Skies Over Japan 

Frfm Japan and Korea to Singapore and New Britain, the air arm of General 
n,„iirlas iMacArtliur's command yesterday assaulted Japan's homeland and kept 
?er cutoff ovtrseas garrisons powerless to celebrate Far East An- Forces' contribu- 
tion to the US Armv Air Forces' world-wide observance of their 38th Anniversary. 



General George C. Kenney, • it's not the old-timers who liave 



the man who heads the far- 
flung activities of the Far East 
Air Forces which cover an area 
larger than any single air com- 
mand in the world, yesterday 
paid tribute to the men and 
women of his command who 
made this unprecedented ex- 
pansion of airpower possible. 

**What we are doing in the 
Pacific these days/' Kenney 
said, **should stand for all time 
as a silent memorial to those 
men, years ago, who stood up 
and shouted for airpower. But 



brought us to where v/e are to- 
day—it's the kids. Tomorrow 
these kids will be looking at 
Japan from step-ladder height 
and from 10,000 feet, aiming 
their bombs and their guns at 
the Nip miHtary targets that 
represent one more hurdle be- 
tween now and the end of the 
war. They'll be working in the 
tropical sun on airplanes and 
engines and paper work on both 
sides of th^e equator — yes, and 
women too." 
General Kenney stated that 



day after tomorrow, depending 
on which tomorrow the Nip 
realizes he's had enough, these 
same kids v/ill be running our 
mighty air forces. They've 
proved themselves in the tough- 
est test of them all — in combat 
leadership. 38 years ago, when 
the Army gof its first airplane, 
places like Borneo and Okina- 
wa seemed far away. Today 
they're our home grounds, and 
nothing is very far away. It's 
taken us 38 years to shrink the 
world ^o its present size, but 
we'll never let it expand again." 



Weygand, Defending Retain^ 
Takes Blame for Amistice 

PARIS— Appearing as defense witness for former 
Vichy premier Henri Philippe Petain, Gen. Maxime 
Weygand, commander of the French army when it col- 
lapsed in 1940, yesterday assumed full responsibility for 
the French armistice. . , . ^ ^ 

*1 considered it my duty as commander-in-chief to 
ask for the armistice. I took responsibility for the deci- 
sion myself and on purely militaiy grounds. There was 
no question of collusion with Marshal Petain,'' Weygand 

^said.

Late Tuesday, Nimitz re-

A special meeting will be held 
of all life and regular mem-

Club of Manila entitled to vote, 
for the purpose of electing a 
board of directors and renew- 
ing activities of the Club. 

The meeting will be held in 
the auditorium (second floor) 
of the Normal School Building, 
located just south of the City 
Han, on Sunday, August 5, 
from 4 to 6 p.m. 

IVfASS FOR QUEZON 

A hig'h requiem mass was of- 
fered in the Catholic Church of 
old Pa^ay by the faculty and 
student body of St. Mary's Aca- 
demy, in memory of the lat^ 
Manuel Quezon. 



"Paris was menaced from all 
sides. The troops were dead 
tired. I decided to declare 
Paris an open city because my 
duty as commander-in-chief 
did not demand useless sacri- 
fices in a defense which could 
not succeed." 

Weygand revealed that the 
French air force had only 510 
planes, whereas ^*the Germans 
had 1,500 fighters and 3,000 
bombers.^' 

The witness declared that 
Petain sent a secret telegram to 
Admiral Jean Darlan "ordering 
the Admiral to cease operations 
against the U.S. and British 
forces at the time of the land- 
ing in North Africa" in the fall 
of 1942. 

Weygand's testimony did not 
make clear whether Darlan ever 
received the telegram, but it 
was the first time anyone had 
stated that Petain had played 
any part in halting French re- 
sistance to the Allies. 



British Kill 
6,000 Japs in 
Burma Battle 

CALCUTTA— More than 6,- 
000 Jap troops have been kiUed 
and almost 600 captured in 
fighting between the Mandalay- 
Rangoon Road an^ Sittang 
River in Burma, Southeast 
Asia com.mand headquarters 
announced yesterday. 

The total covered nihe days 
of fighting, and included an ad- 
ditional 2,000 Jap troops re- 
ported killed by British forces 
in the lower Sittang River bend 
area. 

More than 600 Japs were 
captured, and the list of killed 
did not include those killed by 
Allied guerrilla forces. 

Fighting broke out in the 
area about 80 to 150 miles 
northeast of Rangoon as the 
Japanese strove to make their, 
way eastward into Thailand. 

In the village battle, 10 miles 
southeast of Pyu, Indian troops 
fought more than 300 Japs who 
had artillery support. More 
than 100 enemy dead were 
found after the engagement.

Declaring President Quezon "would have preferred 
death to service under the hated enemy, President 
Osmena yesterday rapped critics who accused tne late 
President of deserting his post during Jap occupation. 

Quezon's decision to transfer the Cornmonwealth 
5,overnment to Washington "was not only the wise, and 
StrTotiS thing to do, but the only thing to do unaer the

tried to hit the airman with 
my hammer, but he was too close 
to me. I tried to push him 
away, so that I could get a good 
crack at him. But I pushed too 
hard and he went out of reach," 
Wuest added that someone 
had taken his hammer, and 
when it was returned, minus a 
head, all the airmen were lying 
on the ground dead or dying. 
**It is possible that I beat them 
all,'* he said. 



ine the ftrst ^ 
Q^ezon^s death, the President 
pictured what would have hap- 
pened if Quezon had remamed 
in the Philippines 

-Subjected to the ruthless 
will of the conqueror," Osmena 
said, -President Quezon would 
have been unjustly placed m a 
position where he either had to 
refuse to cooperate and perhaps 
meet the tragic fate of Jose 
Abad Santos— a loss which the 
country could not afford — or 
submit to the enemy and head 
the list of puppet officials. 

"It is my firm belief that 
President Quezon would have 
preferred death to service un- 
der the hated enemy. 

"But supposing that, in- 
stead of continuing his role as 
leader of the resistance, he 
had chosen to be an instru- 
ment in the execution of Jap- 
an's sinister designs, then he 
would have inflicted the 
cause of the Philippines in 
the United States an injury 
beyond repair." 

President Osmena's speech 
was aired over a radio hookup 
which extended to the United 
States. By Osmena's order, 
August 1 was observed as a 
public holiday. Observance 
began with a Requiem Mass at 
San Beda Church in Manila, 
while in Washington, friends of 
the late President attended 
mass at St. Matthews Cathedral 
and services at Quezon's tomb 
in Arlington National Ceme- 
tery. 

Manuel Quezon was "the 
logical and supreme leader 
of our national resistance" 
against the Japanese, Presi- 
dent Osmena declared. "Our 
people in general, and our 
soldiers and guerrilleros in 
particular, accepted his lead- 
ership and backed it to the 
limtt." 

Under Quezon's leadership. 
President Osmena said, the 
government of the Common- 
wealth functioned in Washing- 
ton as if it were a sovereign 
government. 

"The Commonwealth ac- 
quired an advanced political 
status because, anticipating the 
promised recognition of our in- 
dependence, the American gov- 
ernment had taken steps to in- 
vest us with intematignal per- 
sonality," said Osmena. 

Quezon also succeeded in 
focussing the interest of the 
people of the United States^ on 
the problenis of the Pacific, ac- 
cording to Osmena. 

"The success of American 
arms, ably assisted by the 
long-suffering Filipino gue- 
rrillas and civilian volun- 
teers, is a monument to the 
vision and faith of President 
Quezon," the Presidi^nt de- 
clared. 



One of the outstanding ac- 
complishments of the Quezon 
administration in Washington, 
Osmena said, was the enact- 
ment of legislation providing 
for establishment of military 
and naval bases in the Philip- 
pines "for the mutual protec- 
tion of the United States and 
the Philippines and fhe main- 
tenance of peace in the Pacific." 

Osmena reiterated his sug- 
gestion that President Quezon's 
body be returned to the Phil- 
ippines as soon as the military 
situation permits. He also 
mentioned anew his intention 
to recommend a life pension for 
Mrs. Quezon.

TREASURE HUNT AT FULL BLAST IN MANILA BA) 



MANILA 



Pub^islicl dnlly except 



Unit 



DECISION AT POTSDAM 

Japan's war leaders have officially turned down last week's 
surrender ultimatum issued by the heads of the U.S., British, 
and Chinese governments. 

Terms of this ultimatum gave Japan one last opportunity 
to end this war, and avert "complete destruction of Japanese 
armed forces and the Japanese homeland." 

Against an Allied promise that Japan would not be en- 
slaved, that there would be restoration of fundamental human 
rights, and eventual Japanese participation in world trade, 
Japan's leaders offer their people only the most terrible ordeal 
any nation has been called upon to endure in history. 

In the intervening seven days since the ultimatum was is- 
sued, the Japanese have seen more than eight more cities de- 
vastated by fire bombings, their fleet reduced tazero by com- 
bined blows of Admiral Halsey's Allied carriers and General 
Kenney's land-based bombers, their coastal cities flattened by 
the big guns of American and British battleships. No Japan- 
ese surface ships have dared challenge, nor planes take to the 
skies in a gallant, last defense. 

What the next week, and the weeks after that, will bring, 
no one can say, except intensity of these blows will mount with 
each tick of the clock. This much Is certain. 

History will record, unless unconditional surrender halts 
this carnage, that Japan's leaders wilfully murdered a 
nation of 80,000,000 people. 

The Japanese people can stand by and let this happen. 
Or they can overthrow their tyrants and salvage a share in the 
future.^ It is a decision only Japanese themselves can make. 
And time is growing short. 



FEA Expanding Staff Here 
Tc'- Take Care of Supplies 

The Foreign Economic Administration is sending a 
bigger staff to tlie Philippines to prepare for the taking 
over of Philippine supply channels September 1, when 
the United States Army is scheduled to give up distri- 
bution of civilian goods. 

• ^ Van Lear Woodward, director of the FEA Philip- 
pine mission, said yesterday ten more men would arrive 
in Manila within the next few weeks. The group will 
include George Bell, now head of the Pan-American 
Branch of the FEA. 



When the FEA takes over 
the distribution of civilian con- 
sumer p:ooc1s from the Army, 
all stocks of food, clothing and 
medicines would be at the 
FEA's disposal, it was ex- 
explained. 

Woodward said 40,000 tons 
of food, clothinp: and medicines 
would arrive in the Philippines 
monthly commencing w i t h 
September shipment. There 
would be an additional 20.000 
tons of other commodities. The 
first vessel, brinirinp: 8,600 
tons of essential goods, is due 
to arrive this month. 

These will be augmented by 
increasing amounts of commer- 
cial goods as more United 
States exporters are coming 
back iixto Philippine trade. Ar- 
rangements have been com- 
pleted for the return of essen- 
tial l^usinessmen to .the Islands 
at the rate of 12 a month.

Jap in North Luzon 

WITH SIXTH DIVISION 
ON LUZON — Chaplain

tured a Jap the other day. 

He and his driver, Cor-

gave himself up. 



Japs Weaken in 
Sittang Front 

CALCUTTA— The battle of 
the Sittang River bend in 
Burma, where the Japanese have

with Jap casualties estimated at 
some 6,000 killed, the South- 
east Asia command headquar- 
ters announced yesterday. 

Allied air patrols joined at- 
tacks Wednesday, made hits on 
machine gun positions and de- 
stroyed huts and buildings. 
Ground patrols wiped out several 
rear guards of the enemy, while 
other Jap units were killed 
along the river banks.

Austrian Chief Hits 
4'Ply Occupation 

NEW YORK— Dr. Karl Ren- 
ner, head of the Renner cabinet 
in Vienna, said division of Aus- 
tria into four separate zones for 
occupation purposes made it im- 
possible to establish efficient 
administration, according to a 
N. Y. Times dispatch Wednes- 
day. 

To improve administration of 
Austria, Renner suggested *'the 
four powers should form cne su- 
pervising body and let Austria 
run herself as a single country, 
with Allied supervision in each 
department." 

Prompt release of Austrians 
who were captured by the Allies 
while fighting with the German 
army also was advocated by 
Renner. 



Army, Navy Divers Go After 
^17,000,000 in Silver Coin 

Soldiers and sailors are picking up silver coir 
literally speaking, by the G.I. can full. It may soui 
like a dream assignment. But they go down into I. 
feet of water after it, and every bit goes back to tl 
government. 

When the fall of Corregidor appeared certain 
1942, gold and securities were removed by submarir 
There wasn't the time or space to move the 17 milli< 
pesos of silver coins. The Army dumped this mon^ 

into Manila bay. ^ 

The 17 miUion pesos aggre- 
gated 240 tons. 

Last month the Army and 
Navy organized divers for re- 
covery of the money. Records 
of the exact location had been 
misplaced, so they asked that 
2nd Lt. Tore H. Anderson, and 
his special mine detecting de- 
vice, be flown here from Ft. 
Belvoir, Va. 

Meanwhile, the salvage group 
obtained information as to the 
approximate location of the 
silver hoard. Once the lieute- 
nant was on the job to assist 
them, the divers went to work. 
They found the boxes 
which had contained the 
money had been, eaten away 
by underwater worms. The 
silver was scattered in loose 
piles over an area 200 feet in 
diameter. 
Divers could stay on the bot- 
tom only 30 minutes, .^t takes 
them 45 minutes to "decom- 
press" on the way up. G. I. 
cans are lowered into the wa- 
ter, and a diver can fill one in 
his 30-minute underwater stay. 
Each can holds about PI 1,000 
or 500 pounds of silver. Money 
weighed accurately as it is I 
brought to the surface. | 
Navy Doats constantly patrol 
the area. Salvage boats are 
manned by crews of 70, includ- 
ing 15 divers. 

Recovering the money will 
equire another five or six 
months, it was estimated. It 
isn't all in one spot. The Japs 
emoved some of it in two 
boats, v/hich were subsequently

complete responsibility for his 
business transactions and denied 
that his father, the late presi- 
dent, had ever assisted him in 
promoting any loans.

respected him have a right to 
know that Frardclin D. Roosevelt 
never promoted or assisted my 
personal business affairs. The 
responsibility for them was and 
still is. mine,' and mine alone."

On the 38ih amiiversary of Army Air Forces, General 
Douglas MacArthtir^ told a worM-wtde radio audience 
Wednesday night> the e^rcatest air fleet in history was being 
amassed for the "last blow" In the PaoiBe. 

General Mac Arthur's statement said: 

'*TonLght we celebrate a ercat birthday. By virtue of 
the vision of many men and the indomitable courage of 
many others, wc have developecl the swift and deadly force 
of a new dimension of warfare. It has justified the dreams 
we had for it in the and the plans we made for it in 

the 1930's, f 

"Here In the Pacific, where distance has been one of 
our main problems, air power has risen to Its greatest

Army Warns Manilans 
To Conserve on Water 

Declaring misuse was overtaxing Manila's water 
system, Army officials today warned civilians and 
military personnel to comply with conservation direc- 
tives or face the prospect of water rationing. 

Manila's water system has a nonnal daily capacity 
of 50 million gallons, while consumption averages 67 
million gallons, according to a report by engineers of 
U. S. Army Forces Western Pacific, who have just 
completed an exhaustive survey. 

An AFWESPAC spokesman^ 
said the water supply was ade- 
quate for the city's needs provide 
cd present abuses were discon- 
tinued itii mediately. 

Unauthorised washing? of ve- 
hicles, permittinpT broken lines 
to run free, failure to turn off 
water when not in use, and un- 
authorized tapping of hydrants 
and mains are the principal 
Ccius'es of the situation, which is 
growing progressively worse. 

With purification and pump- 
injr facilities already over- 
burdened, the condition is 
vatcd bv a lack of machinery 
and parts to replace worn out

WASHINGTON— japan, despite repeated protests, 
is attempting to protect target areas from American air 
bombing by locating prisoner of war camps near targets, 
the State Department said Wednesday. 

The State Department was endeavoring to verify 
the Tokyo radio report that a war prisoners camp was 
hit during a Superfortress bombing of Kawasaui July 
26, when S. war prisonei's were reported injured. 

Swiss author iticij have beeni- 

asked to investigate the report

partment said- 
Japan's replies to S. pro- 
tests against usinicr prisoners to 
protect target areas "have been 
ovafiive" the department re- 
ported. 

American flyers are carefully 
briefed on the location of all 
known camps to minimize, to the 
j^reatest possible extent, the 
danger to Allied war prisoners. 

Japan is not party to the 
Geneva convention covering 
treatment of war prisoners but 
had agreed to abide by the con- 
vention's terms. 

The first S. protest to 
Japan against locating of prison- 
ers camp^; near military targets 
was made in September, 1944. 
The U* S. informed Japan last 
March that it was apparent 
Japan was following *a 'deli- 
berate" policy.

Tuesday Japan knows she has

and what was left could easily 
be knocked out by air. 

He expressed belief Japan 
was hoarding its planes because 
of gasoline shortages and would

PARIS— Admiral William D. Leahy, personal chit

at the trial of Marshal Henri Philippe Petain, exprease^Qg^j 
conviction that Petain ^'principal concern was sinceiiir 5^ 
for the protection of the helpless people of France/' pded 

"Hov^evei%" continued Leahy/ "I must in all honestHe

Leahy, in his letter, dated<^ 
June 22, observed that his 
kno\vledj2:e of Petain's personal 
and official attitude toward the 
Alliens and toward the Axis 
ppw<^v(l was "strictly limited" to

During that tihie, Leahy told 
Petain, held your personal 
friendship and your devotion to 
the welfare of the French people 
in very high regard." He re^ 
called that Petain ^'had often ex- 
pressed to me the fervent hope 
that the Nazi invaders would be 
destroyed," 

Leahy also recalled that on 
one oceaBion, Petain did take 
action in opposition to the de- 
sires of the Axis and favorable 
to the Allied caijse. 

On every instance when Pe- 
tain failed to accept Leahy's re- 
comfnendation to oppose the 
Axis powers, Petain explained 
that had he done otherwise it 
would have resulted in "addi- 
tional oppression" of his people 
by the invaders^ Leahy said.

TAKE IT EASY 

At first glance, it would seem rather odd that Manllans 
would have to be cautioned about misuse of water in the middle 
of- the rainy season, with reservoirs brimming to capacity, but 
U. S. Army engineers know what they're talking about. 

The present bottleneck lies, not in the amount of water in 
reservoirs, but in conduits, purification units, and pumping sta- 
tions which must traffic water to hydrants and kitchen faucets. 

In the early days of Manila's liberation, it was only the 
brilliant strategy and sacrifice of American and guerrilla blood 
wliich saved intact the three great dam systems serving Manila. 
Without these successes, disease and epidemic would have ra- 
vaged Manila deeper than the scorching blast of war. At^ no 
time was the capital of the Philippines without water— the price- 
less ingredient of health, sanitation, and life itself. 

Tliat danger has been met and conquered. But the present 
situation is complicated by the fact that Manila's population has 
been swollen by refugees and U. S. soldiers. Broken conduits 
cannot be restored overnight. Purification and pumping nna- 
chinery replacements must await priority for weapons which 
must come first. 

No one here is going to die of thirst. But everyone can 
hdp in relieving the present shortage, and avoid the nuisance 
of rationing by simply taking it easy on water. 

Army spokesman mention unauthorized washing of cars, 
permiHing broken lines to run free, and failure to turn off water 
when not in use. Water, in a city recovering slowly from one 
of the cruellest premeditated blows in the history of this war, 
is too p recious to waste. ———====== 

Control Coumcil Fixes 
Exact Zones in Berlin 

BERLIN— The four-power control set up for Ber- 
lin officially designated itself the "Allied Kommandatur'' 
Thursday, at the same time announcing an agi^eement 
had been reached on the exact international boundaries 
among U. S., Russian and British zones in the capital. 

Russia will occupy 12 boroughs, and the British 
and Americans six each. The French zone was not men- 
tionod, but press dispatches earlier this week said it 
would be carved from the British and American zones. 

Berlin's food situation was 
discussed Thursday at a Kom- 
mandatur meeting, and a supply 
committee of senior Allied offi- 
cials was appointed to deal with 
the coal situation. 

Britain, the U. S. and Russia 
will supply equal quantities of 
gasoline and fuel oil in the city. 

Gustav Kimpel has replaced 
Dr. Andreas Hermes as the 
German chief of supply for 
Berlin.

Army to Grant 
AfiOO Leave to 
Help Railroads 

WASHINGTON — The 
War Department will grant 
temporary furloughs to 
approximately 4,000 men to 
help operate the nation'ss 
railroads, director of WarS 
Mobilization John W. Sny- 
der announced Thursday, 

The manpower shortage on 
western U. S. railroads is heav- 
iest but the U. S. employment 
service and the railroad retire- 
ment board are carrying out a 
.successful recruitment program 
for additional workers, Snyder 
disclosed. 

Despite present labor diffi- 
culties, the stupendous job done 
by the railroads in redeployment 
work and materiel transporta- 
tion is continuing. 

In addition to releasing sev- 
eral thousand experienced rail- 
road workers in the next 
few months the War Depart-

Probe of Charges 
Against Cruz Set 

Dr. Jose S. Reyes, secretary 
to the President, has ordered 
City Mayor Juan Nolasco to 
investigate charges filed 
against Cipriano Cruz, chief of 
the Manila Fire Department, 
it was learned at the depart- 
ment of interior yesterday.^ 

The appointment of Chief 
Fireman Cruz was not acted 
upon by the Commission on 
Appointments of Philippine 
Congress at its 'last session as 
a result of charges filed 
against him by Maria de 
Samio. 

Mrs. Samio accused Cruz of 
collaboration with the Jap- 
anese, nepotism, profiteering 
during the occupation, failure 
to render 24-hour duty as 
provided by the law, addic- 
tion to liquor and other ir- 
regularities. 



To Give Out Cabbage 
Seeds in Lanao Area 

Edward Kuder, guerrilla 
writer and division superinten- 
dent of schools for Lanao who 
arrived in Manila last Thurs- 
day, will help the Lanao pro- 
vincial officials step up food 
production campaign in that 
province. 

Kuder said he had brought 
with him sufficient cabbage 
seeds from the United States 
which he will distribute among 
the Lanao officials. Cabbages 
grow quite large in Lanao due 
to the semi-temperate climate. 



54,000 Men Involved in 
Record Super Fortress H( 



GUAM— Efforts of 54,000 
Americans vi^ere required to 
carry out the 820 Super 
Fortress attack on five Jap- 
anese war centers Thursday, 
it was revealed yesterday. 

Of these, 900 were Ameri- 
can pilots, bombardiers, and 
gunners, who were over Jap- 
an between midnight and 3 
a.m. Another 45,000 crew- 
men labored aground to get 
the giant bombers ready for 
the greatest single mission in 
history. 

The Super Forts carried 
5,330,000 gallons of high test 



gasoline. Combined mile 
was 2,460,000. Crewmen c 
sumed 126,280 -man hoi 
sweating out the long ov 
water flight from the Mai 
nas. 

If all planes had taken 
simultaneously from all av 
able airfields in the Maria

would have required 90 n 
utes to get planes into the 
at the rate of one plane e^ 
seven seconds. If they 
been lined up nose to tai

train approximately 18 m 
long.

Taft expressed the opinion 
that *'war damage insurance to 
cover all kinds of privately 
owned property were covered 
in the U. S, by insurance of the 
War Damage Coi"pofation." 

This corporation has more 
than $:30D.OOO.OOO proEt from

Taft pointed out. 

He also favored compensation

much of which was completely

Taft suggested thai the

ATC Marks Up 
Perfect Record 
In SWPA Area 

A record of some 290,000,000 
passenger miles flown over the 
sea and jungle, without a sin- 
gle passenger fatality, high- 
lighted the Air Transport Com- 
mand's observance of its first 
anniversary on Aug. Is^t. 

The safety record, believed to 
be a new high in transporta- 
tion annals, is based on figures 
for the first 11 nnonths of the 
Wing's existence, plus an esti- 
mate for July, 194i>. 

The terrain over w^hich this 
record was made includes the 
14,000 ft Owen Stanley moun- 
tains of New Guinea, where 
treacherous weather is the rule. 
In addition, the over water pro- 
portion of route's has never been 
less than 50 percent, and since 
the Philippines operation it has 
reached 85 percent 

Although a service rather 
than a combat organization, the 
Wing moved an ATC detach- 
ment to the Tacloban strip, 
Leytc, on October 31, ten days 
after the American landings. 
For two months thei-eafter the 
unit took nightly Jap raids, 
along with the tactical outfits 
at the strip. Beginning Novem^

4 J 40 Additional 
Japs Killed in 
P.L Mopping Up 

Mopping up operations in the 
Philippines have accounted for 
an additional 4,740 enemy dead 
counted and 444 prisoners taken 
in the past week. General Mac- 
Arthur's headquarters an- 
nounced this morning. Fil- 
American casualties were an- 
nounced as 27 killed and 61 
wounded, all ground force per- 
sonnel. 

No Japanese forces larger 
than company strength have 
been encountered in the past 
week. One enemy company 
was wiped out east of Tuguega- 
rao while another enemy force 
numbering less than a company 
was repelled in two desperate 
counter- assaults in the south- 
ern Cordilleras near Mayayao. 
A concentration of Japanese 
south and west of Kiangan had 
dug into the mountains and 
were using machine-guns and 
75's against attempts to dig 
them out. 

Philippine Army patrols 
mopped up scattered units of 
disorganized Japs east of High- 
way 11, which was cleared of 
the enemy two weeks ago. 



The records, supplied by the U.S. Rotary 
Club, were placed aboard a Tokyo-bound 
Superfortress from Tinian and parachuted 
down on the Japanese capital. 

Farnum, who commanded Army garrison 
forces on Tinian at the time, heard them on 
"Tokyo Rose's" program the next day.

THESE CHANGING TIMES 

V/ithin the past few weeks, ihe momentum of America's 
war against Japan has accelerated so swiftly, that it becomes 
easy to overlook what has actually become a vast transforma- 
tion in the entire overall picture. 

As recent as one year ago, Tokyo's mouj-hpieces were 
blandly informing the homeland that Japan never could be 
invaded. In the same smooth phrasing, they declared Gen- 
eral MacArthur's island-hopping strategy was doomed to fail- 
ure. One Japanese commentator went so far as to forecast 
that it would take General MacArthur's ground armies no less 
than 50 years to reach Japan's shores, at his then present rate. 

Today, the world witnesses the last step in a series of bril- 
liant "island-hopping" tactics which have carried General Mac- 
Arthur's land armies from the white beaches of New Guinea's 
Hollandia, to the bomber-jammed island of Okinawa. 

At midnight Friday, General MacArthur took formal com- 
maind of :the entire chain of the Ryukyus. On Okinawa, the 
same general who turned the switch on a whirlwind eight months 
campaign which liberated the entire Philippines and sacked an 
army of 450,000 men, stands only 350 mi!es from Japan's home 
shores of Kyushu. 

And. the same Japanese commentators who decried that 
"island-hopping" was only a mild form of "shadow-boxing" now 
are bleating about the imminent invasion of Japan, goading 
the people to gird their "spiritual" strength, and handing out 
bamboo spears to repel beachheads. And the commentator 
who didn't expect to meet MacArthur for at least 50 years, 
has apparently gone into retirement. 

Beckoning to MacArthur on Okinawa today are the sprawl- 
ing coastlines of China to the west, Korea to the north, and 
t+)e main Japanese islands to the northeast. 

Japan can only sit back and wait. The general who has 
engineered over 80 successful beachheads in the Southwest 
Pacific without defeat, now stands at the threshold of Japan, 
with a larger alrforce, a more powerful army, and the greatest 
navy In history. 

• The bases are loaded, and the heaviest slugger of them 
all is at bat. 



War Demands 
Delay Output 
For Civilians 

WASHINGTON — Continued 
high military demands, coupled 
with manpower shortages and 
backlogs of unfulfilled orders, 
are delaying production of goods 
for civilian use, the War Pro- 
duction Board announced Fri- 
day. 

With controls lifted from the 
majority of industries the prob- 
lem now, is to bring, supply and 
requirements into balance, the 
board said. It noted only spe- 
cific limitation order remaining 
is that covering wood-working 
machinery. 

**Other industries are on their 
own and are being urged to 
make every reasonable effort 
to find an answer to their own 
problems. The exception is 
where materials and compo- 
nents are required, for military 
production, and where emer- 
gency circumstances arise." 

Labor and equipment short- 
ages still hamper the food pro- 
cessing machinery industry. 
Also, no improvement was 
noted in the delivery of elec- 
trical motor and control equip- 
ment. Some betterment was 
predicted later this year, how- 
ever.

Yanks Halt Jap 'Hospital' 
Ship, Find Ammo and Guns 

An. Allied naval force from blockading vessels of the 
Seventh Fleet boarded a Japanese hospital ship in the Banda 
Sea Friday and found arms, ammunition and unwounded 
personnel listed as patients, Genera! MacArthur's head- 
Quarters announced Saturday. 

Boarding of the vessel was in strict conformity with 
International Law and rules of the Geneva Convention. 
The boarding party searched the vessel to see that no im- 
proper use was being made of the hospital ship. Contra- 
band found aboard the vessel included 23 heavy machme- 
guns, 15 light machineguns, a quantity of 7o-millimeter 
ammunition marked "medical supplies" and an undeter- 
mined amount of other types of ammunition. 

The ship carried a crew of thirteen officers, sixty-three 
enlisted men and approximately 1,500 listed "Patients 

When bandages were examined on some of the alleged 
patients, no wounds were found. The ship was being 
brought into an Allied port for further examination.

Igorot Women Pack Piece-Meal 
Jeeps Over North Luzon Peaks 



IN NORTHERN LUZON— 
Jeeps carried piece-meal over 
9,000-foot mountains on the 
backs of Igorot women is the 
latest and most fantastic mira- 
cle of Yank ingenuity to come 
out of the 32nd Division's mop- 
ping up action in the Caraballo 
Mountains of Northern Luzon. 

When his battalion of the 
127th Infantry Regiment ran 
into an impassable road block 
during pursuit of Japs on High- 
way No, 11, north of Baguio, 
Lt. Col. Powell A. Fraser, put 
the portage plan into operation. 
The enemy had blasted the side 
of an entire mountain, so that 
badly needed highway supply 
line was cut off. 



At least two weeks would be 
required for division engineers 
to cut a new road. Col. Fraser 
and his men didn't have that 
much time. 

The officer gave the order to 
disassemble the battalion's 
jeeps. When it was found that 
all the male Filipinos were en- 
gaged elsewhere, scores of 
sturdy Igorot women volun- 
teered for the job. The wonien 
made the carry over one peak 
that reared 2,000 feet above the 
road, and in the face of enemy 
opposition. 

Once on the other side of the 
gap, the jeeps were reassembled 
and the flow of material con- 
I tinued.

All of the 175,000 patient- 
flights have been carried out 
within the Southwest Pacific

vacuations to the United States. 

Figures and a report of acti- 
vity released by the FEAF Air 
Surgeon's office gave evidence 
that the combat efficiency of the 
armed forces in the Pacific has 
been substantially improved as 
a result of the speed of air eva-

Trains Move 800 Civilians 
Daily As Service Expands 

An average of 800 civilian passengers and 96 tons 
of civilian traffic a day is now being handled by the 
Manila Raihoad company between Manila and San Fer- 
nando, La Union, it was learned yesterday from Major 
Paul Shelmerdine, of the Rail-Highway Traffic Regu- 
lating Group of the Transportation Command, 
which leaves^ 
daily, 



On each train 
Tutuban Station at 5 p.m 
two coaches are assigned to 
civilians. The tr^in arrives in 
San Fernando, La Union, at 3:35 
the following morning. The 
same number of coaches are also 
assigned to civilian traffic on 
each train leaving San Fernan- 
do daily at 5 p.m., arriving in 
the city at 4 a.m. 

In order to avoid unnecessary 
contusion in the sale of tickets, 
the ticket booths are opened to 
the public at 1 p.m, each day 
and only the number of people 
and freight as can reasonably 
be accommodated in the two 
coaches are sold tickets. Filipi^ 
no soldiers on leave are usually 
given priority over ordinary 
civilian passengers. Pre-war 
rates are charged* 

Major SheLmerdine revealed 
that no civilian trafHc is yet al^ 
lowed on the southbound trains 
due to military necessity. He 
disclosed however that civilian 
passengers and freight will be 
accepted on the southbound 
trains as soon as the necessaiy 
facilities are available.

CHUNGKlNG^Lt. Gen. 
Albert Wedcmeyer. back 
from a 5,0 00 -mile tour of 
six Chinese provinces, said 
yesterday as a rcj^ult of 
what he saw be felt ''more

companied tlie China thea- 
ter chief on his tour. This

WITH HALSEY'S THIRD 
FLEET OFF JAPAN, (delayed) 
—Describing the destruction of 
the Japanese cruiser, Oyodo, in 
the Inland Sea by U. S. carrier 
planes on July 28 which 
■'swooped down from all direc- 
tions converging at 500 miles an 
Iiour," Richard W. Johnston, an 
eye-witness, wrote: 

* Eleven planes started at 
9,000 feet. They released their 
500 bombs at 1,500 feet and 
pulled out of their dives in a 
dizzy cross patch that shot them 
past each other so fast that each 
pilot saw only a blur, 

'The inverted cone of the 
descending bombs continued 
below them. One bomb hit. 
Then another and another — 
until five had plunged into the 
once proud enemy warship. 
Five more ploughed the water 
alongside, ripping the Oyodo's 
plated sides. 

"That was sufficient. As the 
flyers swung away they saw 
the Oyodo slowly roll over on 
her side and they watched the 
cruiser die."

The latest warning raised 
to 3X the number of Japanese 
cities which have been pre- 
warned of attacks by B-29*s. 
Ten of the 31 cities Inarked 
for destruction already had 
been bombed. 
In each previous case where 
cities were warned, some of the

The mining operation, on the 
largest scale of its kind ever 
attempted, began on March 27, 
the spokesman revealed. 

At that time, Japan had com- 
plete access to her shippmg 
lanes, and the great industrial 
cities of southern Honshu de- 
pended upon water transporta- 
tion for 75 percent of movew 
ments of all goods.

systematically enslaved most of Europe's millions, have been 
"boycotted" by tKeIr fellows. Among those who refuse to 
Keve anything to do with Streicher and Ley are Admiral Karl 
Doenltz, Joachim Von Rlbbentrop, Hermann Goering, and 
several of Germany's top generals. 

Doenltz is quoted as saying, "We consider Streicher the 
biggest war criminal In Germany, and we won't eat with him 
or associate with him." 

All 'of which is strange sounding talk. The air of self- 
Vightebus Indignation which Doenltz appears to be draping 

• ^around himself and his fellow generals hardly jibes with the 
^record. 

From, 1933 until Germany's fascist dream of world con- 
quest tumbled In unconditional surrender last May, Streicher 
was murdering Jewish men, women and children, sacking syna- 
gogues, vlllffying them to the world. Yet there Is not one 
' Instance on record where any of Germany's generals ever pro- 
tested against this sadistic spree of unparalleled violence. In- 
siead, there Is every Indication that Germany's military man 
were party to every Hitler scheme to reconstitute Germany as 
a v/ar power. 

The same Is true of Ley, who wiped out all labor unions 
in Germany, harnessed the backs of millions to Germany's war 
machine. None of Germany's military protested, or Interced- 
ed for the" exploited. Instead they gloated over the masses 
of guns, planes, and shells which streamed from Ley's slave 
factories.*. ... 

Wha.t lies behind this "holler than thou" attitude now 
voiced by Germany's military hierarchy? The answer Is ob- 
vious. Just as in the last war, the German general staff is 
a^^emptlng to divorce itself from the brutalities, the crimes, 
and the sins committed by and for It. 

In the last war, the German general staff shifted blame 
from itself onto the back of Kaiser Wilhelm. In this one, they 
are attempting to divorce themselves of Nazism's evil taint, by 
.pinning Germany's crime before the world onto Hitler and his 
Nozi party. 

This time the world is too alert. This time the trick will fail. 
This time Germany's military chieftains, too, must bear the 
stigma. 

Germany's General Staff, which survived one total defeat 

• intact, must be erased for all time, this time.

Truman Signs 
3 International 
Relation Bills 

WASHINGTON— Presi- 
dent Truman has formally 
approved the Bretton 
Woods 'bill, a provision for 
participation in the United 
Nations food and agricul- 
tural organization, and a 
bill increasing the lending 
authority of the Export- 
Import Bank five fold to aid 
post-war trade and recon- 
struction, the White House 
announced Sunday. 

Thus the U. S. became the 
first major country to ratify 
the Bretton Woods agreement 
establishing a $9,100,000,000 in- 
ternational bank and an 
$8,800,000,000 international mo- 
netary stabilization fund. 

The bank and the fund will 
not function until other coun- 
tries among the 44 signatories 
constituting 65 percent of the 
total fund have approved. 

Free Passage for 
P. I. Repatriates 

WASHINGTON— U. S. citi- 
zens repatriated from liberated 
Philippines, Guam, and Wake 
will receive special treatment 
because they were not warned 
to return before the Japanese 
attack on Pearl Harbor, the 
State Department said Sunday. 
Most repatriates were required 
to pay their own way back to 
the U.S., but Acting Secretary 
of State, Joseph Grew, said an 
arrangement had been made 
with, the War Department to 
bring these citizens back from 
abroad free of charge. 



Japs Aamit 'Suicide' Air 
Attacks Prove Too Costly 

SAN FRANCISCO — A Japanese broadcast Saturday 
transmitted in full a Tokyo newspaper editorial which ad- 
mitted Japan no longer could dissipate, her air force against 
the Allied surface fleet on a "plane for ship" basis, federal 
monitors here reported. , i 

The broadcast quoted the newspaper as saymg that I 
continued suicide attacks by "Special Attack Corps" were | 
too heavy a sacrifice of pilots and planes. 

This was the first Jap admission that suicide flyers were 
failing to achieve results anticipated. 

Henceforth, according to the editorial, suicide pilots 
would be reserved for attacks on large ships, instead of 
making their death plunges into smaller vessels. 



Plane Production

Halt on Draft 

WASHINGTON— Sen. Robert 
Taft Sunday proposed that a 
Republican legislative program 
calling for immediate halt in 
drafting of men into the anned 
services and early relaxation of 
wartime controls on business. 

The Taft statement said 
8,300,000 men were now serving 
in the anned forces and de- 
clared "It is impossible to see 
how 7,000,000 men can be used 
in the war against Japan." 

The Republican senator called 
for immediate mobilization of 
surplus Army troops to avoid a 
"critical situation" following the 
defeat of Japan.

Declares Exclusion from U.N. 
'Arbitrary, Unjust' Action 

MADRID — Generalissimo Franco's government 
yesterday declared that it '^rejects as arbitrary and 
unjust" the Potsdam proclamation excluding Spain 
from membership in the United Nations. 

Following the pattern of the Spanish press and 
radio accounts of the Potsdam statement, Franco's 
Madrid radio communique did not mention the reason 
cited by President Truman, Generalissimo Stalin, and 
Prime Minister Attlee for Spain's exclusion — that 
Franco's government was established with Axis help.

'Battleships' to Fool Enemy Spies 



LONDON— During the first 
two years of the war the 
British Navy used dummy 
battleships and aircraft car- 
riers to deceive enemy recon- 
naissance planes and bombers, 
the British Admiralty re- 
vealed yesterday. 

Regular merchant ships 
were camouflaged with ela- 
borate superstructures of ply- 
wood and canvas. Their hold 



were crammed with empty 
barrels to give them greater 
buoyancy in case of torpedo- 

These vessels, manned by 
Royal Navy crews, roamed 
the world on special duties. 

One real battleship, the 
35-year-old Centurion, was 
converted into a reasoliable 
imitation of the new battle- 
ship Anson. It went__to_ 



Bombay in a convoy. 

During the monsoon in the 
Indian Ocean dummy turrets 
were swept away and look- 
outs on the convoy reported a 
14-inch gun turret floating 
on the sea. 

The Centurion was sunk as 
a blockade ship off the Nor- 
mandy coast on D-Day to 
form a breakwater for land-

Hornet Escapes 52 Days of 
Attacks, Kayoed by Record 



WASHINGTON— The U. S. 
air craft carrier Hornet and 
10 other ships are in dry dock 
at Hunters Point for repairs 
or overhauling:, the Navy de- 
partment announced yester- 
day. 

The Hornet was knocked 
out of the Pacific war, tem- 



porarily, by a t^'tihoon on 
June 5, after 52 days under 
Japanese air attack without 
being: hit even by a machine - 
ffun bullet. 

A 138-mile an hour gale 
tossed up a huge wave, caus- 
ing the carrier to hit the 
surface of the water with 



such force that the corners of 
her flight deck w^ere bent back 
along the side of the ship. 

The Hornet's record in the 
Pacific included 668 planes 
shot down, 742 planes de- 
stroyed on the groimd, 10 de- 
stroyers sunk, one carrier and 
42 cargo ships sent to the 



Jap Air 
Typhoon 

bottom. In one day her crev*^ 
shot down 67 enemy planes. 

Other ships at the Califor- 
nia shipyard were the de- 
stroyers Boxer, Lavallette, 
Wickers, Newcomb, Morris, 
Ingraham, Leutze, Duffy and 
Wintle and the submariiBe 

Guitarre. 



20,000 Troop 

Move Record 

WASHINGTON— The moving 
of 20,000 veterans off the steam- 
ships Queen Mary and the 
Hermitage and the "sudden de- 
parture from Camp Kihner, 
New Jersey, in a nine-hour pe- 
riod, starting Saturday night, 
was the ''largest single troop 
rail movement of the war," the 
War Department said Sunday. 

"Each veteran boarded the 
train with first class accommo- 
dations, with no soldier travel- 
ing longer than 12 hours with- 
out a sleeping car berth. The 
returnees were headed for a 
reception center nearest their 
home town. 
The nationwide move required 
31 trains consisting of 331 sleep- 
ing cars, 100 coaches, and 41 
kitchen cars. / 



Wipe Out Emperor 
Worship, Solon Urges 

WASHINGTON— The power 
of the Japanese emperor, Hiro- 
hito, must be wiped out ''if we 
are to uproot and destroy 
Fascism in Japan,'* Sen. Scott 
W. Lucas said Saturday. 

"If emperor worship remains 
in Japan after the war is over, 
the Japanese people will not be 
free to choose any form of gov- 
ernment other than what they 
understand today. 

"That would destroy the very 
thing for which we are all fight- 
ing. The time has borne when si 
decision upon the question should 
be made with those fighting the 
war ao^ainst Japan/' Lucas 
declared.

BURBANK, CALIF.— Major Richard Ira Boiigr, Ameri-

Honor, was killed yesterday while testing a jet-propelled 
P-80 plane near the Lockheed Air Terminal here. 

The plane Maj. Bong was testing crashed within a few

Pieces of the plane were blown in small bits over a wide

Witnesses said the plane appeared to be flying very low 
before it suddenly plummeted straight down towards earth. 
Maj. Bong had 40 Japanese planes to his credit.

"Tension before actual detonation was at tre- 
mendous pitch. Failure was an ever present possibi- 
lity. Too great a success envisioned by some of those 
preseht might have meant an uncontrollable and un- 
usable weapon. On Saturday, July 14, a unit which 
was to determine the success or failure of the entire 
proiect was elevated to the top of a steel tower. All 
th-t day and the next, the job of preparation went oti.

A VyiLl-UL htW 

The si'enc3 with which Japan's puppet voices shroud +he 
hir.toric Allied surrender u!fImaiurT> in the homeland unaVr- 
scores rhe potency of the appeal, artd the. extent of turmoil 
wh<-h Vr lias stirred among Japan's masses. 

- Ui the face of every mounting aerial assault, of food 
shoTtages and privation, Japan's warmongers are pressed to 
StiisfactorJiy answer an Allied promise that Japan will not be 
enslaved, titat fundamental human rights will be restored, that 
a nCiW Japan will one day be permitted once more to take her 
pic-e among the family of world nations. As each day passes, 
Japan's leadcsrs find their stock words of indictment against 
the United States growing more thin. They are fighting a losing 
battle against steadily growing conviction among ordinary 
Japantfje citizens that America is not coming to enslave and to 
nrturder. 

Against Tokyo Radio's exhortations that America Is bent 
on conquest, the ordinary Japanese measures President Truman's 
pledgo at BerHn two weeks ago that "there is not one piece of 
tetfJtory or one thing of a monetary nature that we want out 
of this war." Against Suzuki's cry that America is the implac- 
able enemy of the Orient, the ordinary Japanese measures 
ArnericaV course In the Philippines, and the declaration by Gen- 
eral MacArthur before the Philippine congress that America 
Wsll make good her pledge of independence. 

Against the evidence at hand, Japan's ordinary citirens 
mud realize, before It is too late, that only Japan's militarists, 
her Hitlers and her Goebbels, h^ve anything to fear from 
Acceptance of the Potsdam prodamittlon. 

How long Japan will bleed hef&elf ^uselessly for the sake of 
a wilful few, against the most overwhelming odds any nation 
ihas ever been cafled upon to face, only her ordinary citizens can 
'answer. It is their country and their future which lies at stake. 
C>nly they can stave off "prompt aftd utter destruction^

ready well aware. 

The Secretary of War, who 
has kept in personal touch with 
all phases ot the project, will 
immediately make public a 
statement giving further de- 
tails. His statement will give 
facts concerning the sites at 
Oak Ridge near Knoxville, 
Tennessee, and at Richland, 
near Paaco, Washington, and an 
histallation near Santa Fe, New 
Mexico. Although the workers 
at the sites have been making 
materials to be used in produc- 
ing the greatest destructive 
force in history, they have not 
hemseK-eii been in danger be- 
yond that of many other occu- 
pations, fpr the utmost care has 
been taken of their safety. 

The fact that wc can release 
^^t^mic energy ushers in a new 
era in man's understanding of 
nature's forces. Atomic energy 
may in the future supplement 
the power that now comes from 
coal, oil, and falling v/ater, but 
at present it cannot be produced 
on a basis to compete with 
them, commercially. Before 
that comes, there must be a 
long period of intensive re- 
search, 

It has never been the habit 
of the scientists of this country 
or the policy of this government 
to withhold from the world 
scientific knowledge. Nominal

"Whatever films come intc

Approximately 200,000,000 pounds of food has been 
issued to Filipinos under the United States Army's 
civilian relief program up' to the end of July, Ma!a- 
cafian's department of information said yesterday. 

The announcement said Army financed the pro- 
gram, leaving the question of reimbursement* if any, 
to future adjustment between the Commonwealth and 
the American governments. 



This huge amount of food 
v/as sold, through PCAIJ and 
EGA stores or issued as direct 
relief to indigents, 

Malacanan said currently 
900^000 pounds of civilian re- 
lief goods were being distribut-

Men in South Burma 



CALCUTTA— Allied patrols 
have pushed across the old 
Sittang river channel at a point 
60 miles northeast of Rangoon 
in lower Burma while other 
forces battled to wipe out Jap- 
anese remnants still trapped 
west of the river. 

The Southeast Asia Com- 
mand also announced yester- 
day that fighting in the Sit- 
tang area of Burma in recent 
weeks had cost the Japanese 
more than 10,000 dead and the 
virtual destruction of the Jap- 
anese 28th Arrny. 



I WIS I OF FA IE 

Two days have passed since the revolutionary news broke 
thai A<-nerica has unleashed an atomic thunderbolt against 
Japan. There are nnany questions left unanswered. The world 
knows little more about this new weapon, other than that it 
possesses tremendous, awe-lnsplring power, the like of which 
has never been conceived before. 

Yet, th'S much is evident. Those who stoutly maintained 
before this new v/eapon was uncovered, that no war could be 
v/on by air power alone, must certainly be forced to revise 
their judgement. If, In a single blow, a city may be disinte- 
grated by the atomic bomb in Its present stage, then, as more 
and more destructive power Is distilled Into newer and greater 
bombs, an entire country may be dissipated into vapor. Wars 
could be Initiated and ended In a single stroke; perhaps In the 
flight of a single plane. 

Here perhaps, Is the best argument — a final argument — 
for the end to all wars. Science has unlocked the door to 
what may be the greatest agent for good, or evil. In history. 
This agent Is In good hands — but it could have been otherwise. 

All peoples, in the future, through ir,ternatIonal cooperat;on ^^l^ ;^:^-':;,'';!tr^"';ro 
as blueprinted In the United Nations Charter, must see to it ^^^^^ ^^^^.^ required by U. S 
that this fearful weapon is tunneled only In constructive chan- 
nels. The alternative could be the end of the human race, 
feace no longer must be regarded as luxury, but necessity.^ 

History plays odd tricks. Fate took a grim twist when 
Japan fell heir to the first application of the atomic bomb, 
which as President Truman announced, harnesses the "basic 
power of the universe — the force from which the sun draws 
its power." 

For Japan of all nations still clings to the deity of the 
6un god. The sun emblazons her flags, symbolizes her tradi- 
tion. And It Is justice that the force from which the sun 
draws Its power has been loosed against the nation which 
brought war to the Far East; against the nation which draws 
its spiritual stren gth from that whic h shall destroy It.

Seventh Fleet Prize Crews 
Take Arms-Laden Jap Hospital 
Ship Intact Into Allied Port 

AN ALLIED PACIFIC PORT—IT, S. Navy prize';' 
crews from two Seventh Fleet destroyers brought the ^ 
Japanese hospital ship Tachibana Maru into an Allied f,^' 
harbor Monday after it was discovered to be cariying-gj, 
arms, munitions and other war contraband. v 

According to the United Press, the hospital ship - 
marked with Red Crosses indicating it carried neither^ 
arms nor able-bodied soldiers was first sighted by; > 
Australian planes August 1, after it left the Kai islands ^1^ 
heading for Sumatra. Two days later it was halted jjj^ 
by U. S. destroyer prepared to. conduct routine investi 
gation in conformity with international law. 



An unarmed group of 17 U. S. 
Navy personnel then boarded 
the Tachibana Maru carrying 
crowbars, hammers, wire cutters 
and axes and were politely re- 
ceived by the Japanese merchant 
marine officer commanding the 
vessel. 

In searching the ship the 
boarding party found packages 
labeled with red crosses which 
contained 88-millimeter shells 
and fuses. U. S. destroyers 
standing by immediately dis- 
patched additional boatloads of 
sailors and marines to assist in 
searching the ship. When the 
Japanese captain was informed 
that contraband had been found 
and that his ship would there- 
fore be taken over by a prize 
crew, he said he did not know 
contraband was aboard. 

U. S. Navy personnel who are 



hi 

still searching the Tachibana t: 
Maru's holde, have since un- 
covered large supplies of 75- and 
85-millimeter ^shells and fuses, . 
rifles, heavy and light machine '- 
guns, grenades, sabers, knivrs 
and bayonets.. The ship was also 
discovered to be carrying ashes:|^" 
of 300 Japanese being returned *' 
to the Yasuifcuni Shrine to Tokyo, 

The United Press reported);^ 
that 1,562: persons officially)^ 
listed as patients, plus lo .offi-^ 
cers and 6^* men of the Tachi- ^ 
bana Mar-cD's craw havQ been

placed them in a stockade. The'^i 
Tachibana Maru is reported to..^ 
be the first Jananese ship taken */

FEAF Bomber. s Leave Jap Port 
City Wrapped in Roaring Fires 



More than 400 Okinawa-

practically wiped out the in- 
dustrial and waterfront area 
of the south Japanese port 
of Tarumizu in an attack 
that left whole city wrapped 
in roaring flames Mo'nday. ac- 
cording to Frank Robertson 
of International News Service. 



Robertson said: 

"New aircraft and other 
air production plants being 
built by the Japanese to re- 
place factories bombed out 
elsewhere in the enemy 
homeland were demolished. 

"One of targets shattered 
by the 24-hour attack was 
a long sea pier, apparently 
a catapult for rocket-pro- 



pelled air craft. 

"Participating pilots who 
are veterans of the Europe- 
an theater now operating in 
the Pacific said destruction 
at Tarumizu was the 'worst 
thev had ever seen'. . . 

"Some of the planes de- 
stroyed in low level attacks, 
these pilots said, resembled 
German Messerschmitt-163's, 



"Runways leading into 
caves — where aircraft plants 
apparently were hidden — were ^ 
smashed up, while docks dis- k 
integrated under very heavy 
blows. 

"American planes -flew 
through smoke so thick that 
some of them were in danger 
of colliding with each other, 
returning pilots said."

equal to 20.000 tons— 40,000,000 pomids^of TNT. Assumhi^ 
B'Zd*s carry a liiad of 10 tons of TNT. four 500-pJane attacks 
by the world's blgf^est bombers would be necessary to equal 
in destructive power the exploding fury of one atomic bomb. 

Atomic bombs dwarf by 2,000 times the blast power of 
the Britib>h *^Orand Slam*' bomb which wei&hs approximate- 
ly 11 tons.

which we took to San Francisco 
were fulfilled."

They said Hiroshima was 
blotted out first by a flash as 
brilliant as the sun. In a matter 
of minutes, smoke billowed into 
the stratosphere. 

Spaatz, Strate^ric Air Forces 
commander in the Pacific, an- 
nounced that "one of these 
bombs is equivalent to a 2,000- 
piane B-29 attack." 

He said ''photographic evi-

Hiroshima four hours later still

to be operating, it w^as learned 
from the police yesterday, and 
its occupants wprc arrested. 



The others only knew it w^as 
a special mission. 

'*We knew immediately that 
we had to get the hell out of 
there, and we made a sharp 
turn in less than 30 seconds to 
get broadside to the target. 

'*Then — it was hard to believe 
what w^e saw. 

**Below us, rising rapidly, 
was a tremendous black cloud. 
Nothing was visible where 
only a few minutes before, 
the outline of the city with 
its streets and buildings and 
waterfront piers were clearly 
apparent. 

"It happened so fast we could 
not see anything and could only 
feel the heat from the flash and 
the concussion from the blast. 

*'There were a couple of sharp 
slaps against the airplane. It 
felt like close bursts of flak. I 
yelled a warning to the crew, 
but we were all okay.'* 

Parsons, 44, w^ho explained 
his job had been to make it 
comparatively safe for the 
Super Fortress to carry the 



bomb, said the missile, resting 
in the bomb b^, looked like 
the final test facsimile which 
was exploded less than a month 
ago — July 16 — in a remote cor- 
ner of Alamo Gordo, New Mexi- 
co, bombing range. 

**We had a very personal in- 
terest in the mission,-' he said. 
"We knew when w^e started that 
success could only be measured 
in the first battle delivery on 
Japan. 

"We knew it was worth a lot 
in terms of shortening the war. 
When the bomb fell away, we 
began to put as much distance 
between us and the ball of fire 
w^hich w^e knew was- com- 
ing as quickly as possible. 
; "There w^as a terrific flash of 
light — even in daytime. Visual 
shock was apparent for several 
miles. 

"That W'as the first indication 
I had' that the bomb w^orked. 
Each man said, *My God!' 

"What had been Hiroshima 
was going up in a mountain 
of smoke. First I could see 
was a mushroom of boiling 
dust — apparently with some 
debris in it — up to 20,000 feet. 
The boiling continued three 
or four minutes as I watched. 
Then a white cloud plumed 
upwards from the center to 
some 40,000 feet. The angry 
dust cloud spread all around 
the city. There were fires on 
the fringes of the city appa- 
rently burning as buildings 
crumbled and gas mains 
broke." 

The specially selected crew, 
now fully aware of their his- 
tory-making flight, buzzed with 
excitement as they w^atched 
from the plane w'hich was 
named "Enola Gay" for Tib- 
bet's 57-year-old mother, who 
lives in Miami.

one of a group of seven Indian 
business men who have com-

clared yesterday that India 
needed nearly $100,000,000 an- 
nually in addition to its normal 
trade balance in the U. S. "to 
go forward" in its program of 
replacements for India's indus- 
ti-y. 

He said that it is "almost im- 
possible" for India to trade with 
the U. S. because of the short- 
age of dollai exchange.

Japs Must Decide Between 
"^Mass Suicide, Surrender' 



WASHINGTON — The Jap- 
anese must now take their 
choice between "mass suicide or 
surrender/' the Navy Depart- 
ment said, adding "four or five'* 
Japanese cities may have to be 
destroyed by the powerful new 
atomic bomb before the Jap- 
anese people are convinced such 
a bomb exists. 

The statement was contained 
in an official news review of 
the weelv on the Navy Hour 
program, broadcast " Tuesday 
night over a coast-to-coast net- 
work of the National Broad- 
casting Company. 

"It is too early yet to tell 
what effect the atomic bomb 
will hpve on Japanese morale," 



the Navy review said. "We 
may have to destroy four or 
five cities before they actually 
believe we have such a bomb. 

"But we will bring them 
proof. With destruction from 
this new type of bomb and with 
continued damage from planes 
and ships, Japanese fighting 
strength — and perhaps even 
their v.-ill to fight — will rapidly 
weaken." ;

WASHINGTON, August 8- At a hurriedly called press 
Deference today President Truman announced "Russia has 
ieclared war on Japan — that is all" London concur reedy 
eported that the Moscow radio announced Russia was at 

with Japan, effective August 9. 

The Moscow broadcast quoted a statement by Soviet Commissar for 
teign Affairs Viacheslov Molotov received Japanese Minister Sato and 
lave on behalf of the Soviet government, the following for transmission to 
le Japanese government: 

^^After the defeat and capitulation of Hitlerite Germany, Japan became 

the only great power that still stood for the con- 



tinuation of war. 

"The demand of three powers, the United 
States, Great Britain, and China on July 26 on 
unconditional surrender of Japanese armed 
forces was rejected by Japan, and thus the pro- 
posal of the Japanese government to the Soviet 
Union on mediation in the war in the Far East 

loses all basis. 

'Taking into consideration the refusal of Japan to capitu- 
late the Allies submitted a proposal to the Soviet government to 
join in the war against Japanese aggression and thus shorten the 
duration of war, reduce the number of victims, and facilitate 
speedy restoration of universal peace. 

'The Soviet government considers that that this policy is 
the only means able to bring peace nearer, free people from fur- 
ther sacrifice and give the Japanese people the possibility of avoid- 
ing dangers and destruction suffered by Germany after their re- 
fusal to capitulate unconditionally. 

"In view of the above, the Soviet government declares thkt 
from tomorrow, that is from August 9, the Soviet goernment will 
consider itself to be at war with Japan.'' 




Assembled with the president at his 
news conference in Washingon were 
Secretary of State James Byrnes, Ad- 
miral William D. Leahy, naval and 
military aides, and his press secretary, 
as well a?. monil>ori' the Whito, 
HoiLse .staff. 



Reporters said it was the shortest 
news conference on record. The 
president merely said he had a simple 
statement to make but it was so im- 
portant that he felt he should call a 
special conference. He then made 
the announcement. (Cbatinucd on - paj^t-

HISTORIC DESTINY 

Today, Russia has fulfilled the role which destiny had shaped, far 
before ihe drums of war had beaten, oven !n Europe, Today's decision by 
Russia to jo"n the United Nations against Japan, goes back into friction- 
packed history beginning from 1905, and Japan's humiliating defeat of 
Cza rist Russia at Port Arthur. 

Today, Russia identified herself with the i^ame Ideals and objectives 
for a future world which she shared v/ith the United States and Great 
Britain In putting down tyranny and aggression successfully In the European 
war just ended. 

Russia has taken the decision that just so long as an aggressor nation 
exists, there can be no peace for any nation. 

Today, the Allies in the Pacific gain a mighty partner. Some of 
Russia's f nest troops, Siberian units v/h'ch helped halt the tide of Naii 
aggression at Stalingrad, have been poised for nnany months along the 
southern Siberian frontier, which borders Japanese-occupied Manchuria. 
The same partnership in arms which toppled the greatest mll tary machine 
in history—Hitler's Wehrnnacht — is back In action* 

Japan has only one course — unconditional surrender. 
This 15 Japan's third chance. First, there was the way out offered by 
the Potsdam Proclamation on Ju!y 26. The leaders of America, Britain, 
and China yarned that prompt destruction of Japan would follow, unleas 
these terms were accepted. Japan refused, land Monday's atomic bomb- 
ing of Hiro Shima resulted. Pre^sident Truman repeated the terms of tho 
Potsdam declaration; again offered Japan a way out from wholesale 
destruction* Again Japan refused* 

Now, Russia's mighty armies and air forces, her naval units, and her

Super Forts Carry Out Four 
Blows at Japan in 24 Hours 



GUAM— More than 100 B.29's de- 
livered their fourth blow at Japan in 
less tlian 24 hours shortly before 
midnight yesterday on the pre-warn- 
cd industrial city of Fukuyama, 50 
miles east of the atom-bombed city 
of Hiroshima on Honshu. 

The fourth raid was a rain of in- 
cendiaries delivered by the giant 
Tinian-based bombers of Brig. Gen. 
Ivoger M. Ramey's Tinian-based 58th 
Bombardment Wing and marked the 
(Ust city of the Japanese homeland 
to feel the weight of American aerial 
might. 

Fukuyama was the 15th city at- 
tacked out of ol recently warned by 
leaflets that fire and demolition 
awaited them if Japan's armed forces 
did not heed the Potsdam ultimatum 
t(^ surrender unconditionally. 

Earlier yesterday at daylight 225 
Supevforts dropped 2,000 tons of de- 



molition bombs on the steel and gen- 
eral industrial center of Yawata. on 
Kyushu. The second B-29 lasTiing 
six hours later visited the Nakajima 
aircraft plant of Musashimo-Tama, 
one mighty Tokyo arsenal. The third 
blow was the systematic mining of 
four important harbors from North- 
ern Honshu. The waters of Shimo- 
neski, Mausuru and Sakao on Hon- 
shu and Rash in on Northern Korea 
were heavily sown by B-29*s.

RUSSIA COMES IN . . 

MOSCOW— Following is the text 
of Russian Foreign Commissar Via-

Japanese ambassador in Moscow of 
Russia's declaration of w^ar. 

''After the defeat and capitulation 
of Hitlerite Germany, Japan found 
herself to be the only great power

Japan.

BEHIND THE DECISION 

Oufside of the electrifying effect of Russia's entry into 
the war, with Its certain result of shortening the war, the Mos- 
cow decision is significant for two important reasons. 

In the note handed yesterday to Japan's annbassador In 
Moscow, Russia nnade clear that her ainns and objectives in the 
Pacific war are identical with those of the United States, 
Great Britain, and China. 

*Thc Soviet government has associated itself with the dec- 
laration of the Allied powers of July 26," the note said. That 
means that Russia, along with the Allies, will demand that 
Japan be pulled back to her main islands, that those home 
islands will be occupied, that Japan's military forces will be 
disarmed, and that stern justice will be meted out to those 
who "deceived and misled" the people of Japan into war. 

At the same time. It means that Russia does not intend 
to enslave or destroy, that she agrees fully with restoration of 
freedom and human rights in Japan, and that Russia does not 
oppose Japan's eventual participation in future world trade. 

Thus Russia on the West and America on the East present 
a solid diplomatic as well as armed front against the enemy. 

The second significant disclosure in Russia's note today ^ ^ 

was the fact that Moscow revealed that Japan had called on <'but we would use such force 
the Soviet Union to mediate the war between Japan and the 
United States. 

Russia's answer was heartening — virtually Immediate dec- 
laration of war against the common enemy. 

But beyond that, Japan's acfion in approaching Russia on 
the posdbffi'ty of mediating the Pacific war is welcome in- 

drcatiort Htat Japan's resolve to commit "national suicide" by BELGRADE YU- 

continurtjg \he unequal struggle may not be as firm as Tokyo's gOSLAVIA Premier Marshal 

war tedders woafd have the world believe. 



Lucky B r eak Enables Britisli 
To Save 330,000 at Dunkirk 



OKINAWA — The first 
I uuper Fortresses of Lieut. Gen. 
James Doolittla's Eighth Air 
Force arrived here yesterday 
and were hailed as the fore- 
runners of about 1,000 more 
B-29's to complete the conver- 
sion of this island into a gi- 
gantic base. Doolittle said he 
expects to make his first strikes 
against Japan before the end 
of this month and *'by then 
we'll have enough airplanes to 
blast hell out of the Japanese." 
The Super Forts arriving were 
brand new and fresh from 
American factories with each 
capable of carrying a 15-ton 
bomb load. 

Doolittle said that Tokyo is 
closer to Okinawa than to the 
Marianas so his B-29's based 
I there can carry more bombs 
and less gasoline. *Trobably 
no Japanese target is now 
worth the attention of a thou- 
sand Super Forts/' he said, 



perhaps in covering the inva- 
sion area." 



Tito Will Block 
Return of King 



And if rtiis is so, itiere is sfill a chance for Japan to sur-

Perhaps i^.e seeded atomic bombing will help her decide.

Brought to Prague 

' PPvAGUE — Earl Hermann 
Frank, formo.r Deputy Reichs- 
iH'otcctor of Bohemia and 
Moravia, was brought here yes- 
terday by U. S. Anny officers, 
tae Prague Radio reported. 

. After being interrogated by 
tlie CzfechOF^lovak War Crimes

porarily handed over to the U. S. 
invosti<;ation Commission who 
need liiin avS witness in the forth- 
coming- trial* of leading Nazi 
war criininals. He will then be 
rgtiirned to Czechoslovak autho- 



posal to join the war against 
Japanese aggression and by 
this to shorten the period of 
war, to cut down the number 
of victims and to contribute to 
the quickest restoration of gen- 
eral peace. 

''Faithfully, to their duty as 
always, the Soviet government 
has accepted the proposal of 
the Allies and has associated 
itself with the declaration of 
the Allied powers of July 26 
of this year. The Soviet gov- 
ernment considers that only by 
this policy of theirs can peace 
be brought nearer, peoples deli- 
vered from future sacrifices and 
trials, and the Japanese people 
provided with the possibility of 
avoiding the danger and de- 
struction endured by Germany 
after her refusal to capitulate 
unconditionally. 

"In view of the above the 
Soviet government declares that 
from tomorrow onwards, that 
is from August 9. the Soviet 
Union wiU consider itself to be 
in a state of war against Japan." 



Tito told the Peoples Front 
congress "Wednesday King Peter

called into special session Wednesday morning at the 
official request of Admiral Baron Kantaro Suzuki, the

FRANKFURT, GERMANY — 
The aceidental discovery of a 
secret German docmncnt by 
the British enabled them to 
evacuate 330,000 men from the 
trapped beaches of Dunkerque 
in June, 1940, it was disclosed 
yesterday. 

A U. S. Army intelligence of- 
ficer explained German plans 
for a surprise attack in the 
Calais region were in the hands 
of a Nazi officer of the General 



Staff who pushed too far aheai 
of his own lines, and was cap 
tured by a British patrol. 

Only a few hours before th 
attack was scheduled to begii 
a British officer sounded th 
warning which enabled thi 
"core of the British regula 
army to slip through and gavt 
Britain at least a semblance o 
enough strength to hold on un 
til Russia and the U. S. wer< 
drawn to her aid." j 



Jewish Refugee Aids 
In Atomic Research 

NEW YORK — Dr. Lize 
Meitner, the woman physicist 
whose calculations played an 
important part in the develop- 
ment of the atomic bomb, was 
driven from Germany because 
she is Jewish, and is now in 
Stockholm where she is con- 
nected with the Swedish Aca- 
demy of Sciences. 

According to the Associated 
Press it was Dr. Meitner who 
broke a ten-year deadlock in 
the experimentation with 
atomic principles by suggest- 
ing that if experiments would 
split an atom of uranium in 
two approximately equal parts 
— all puzzles would be ex- 
plained. Within two weeks, 
physicists had made th\s test 
and proved her to be rifeht.

Still 



War Potential 

WASHINGTON — The basil! 
pov/er of German industr^ 
which never lost its "tremen-' 
dous recuperative ability'' re-^ 
mains a dangerous war poj 
tential, U. S. Senator Harlej 
M. Kilgore, chairman of the 
Senate's sub-committee on wai- 
mobilization, said yesterday.^ 
Kilgore said that a captured' 
German of ficial report prepared^ 
last ^ear by the Nazi Ministry^ 
for Armaments shov>'ed that* 
despite Allied bombings Gerf 
many was able to rebuild ar.(^^ 
expand its factories " and to in* 
crease war production up to tbr 
final defeat of the Germai 
armies. /| 

Sen. Kilgore stated that many' 
figures revealed in this Nazi 
document proved that Germanjj 
in defeat remains a major threaf 
to the peace of the world and tor 
indicate the extent of de-indus-> 
trialization needed. 7 

For example Germany builv 
more than three times as man\ - 
armored fighting vehicles anc 
fi<>-hter bombers in 1944 as were 
built in 1942, and eight times, 
as many night fighter planes. 
Another example was the manu- 
facture of 159 000,000 pairFi ol 
shoes for military and civiliar '. 
use in German v during 194.. 
v-hile in other European coun - 
tries new footwear was ,almo-t ; 
unknown for three ye^rs or ■ 
more. Kilgore also pointed out. 
the production of coal and 
crude steel Germany 5ast 
year was only slightly less than 
in 1942, according to the off!-/ 
cial German report.

(Continued from Front Page) 

Molotov reminded Japan, in 
his note to Sato, that after the 
defeat and capitulation of Ger- 
many, Japan was the only great 
power *Svhich still insists on 
continuation of war" and point- 
ed out that the Japanese had 
rejected the American-Chinese- 
British surrender ultimatum is- 
sued at Potsdam July 26. 

'Thus the proposal which the 
Japanese government made to 
the Soviet Union concerning 
mediation in war in the Far 
East loses all basis," Molotov 
caid, thus disclosing for the 
first time that Japan had asked 
Russia to mediate between that 
nation and the United States, 
Great* Britain, and China. 

Molotov told correspondents 
he gave Sato permission to send 
his last telegram, after which 
his communications with Tokyo 
were closed. 

^ In Washington yesterday. 
President Truman announced 
the Russian declaration of war 
against Japan in the shortest 
presidential press conference 
on record. 

"I have only a simple an- 
•nouncement to make," the 
President said. *'I cannot 
hold a regular press confer- 
ence today, but this an- 
nouncement is so important I 
thought I would call you in. 
Russia has declared war on 
Japan — that is all." 

In a formal statement by Sec- 
retary of State James Byrnes 
which followed, he said there 
was ''still time — but little time 
— for the Japanese to save 
themselves from destruction." 

In London, Prime Minister 
Attlee welcomed *'this great de- 
cision of Soviet Russia" to 
enter the war against Japan. 
He hailed the action as "proof 
of solidarity which exists be- 
tween the principal Allies."

Dr. Compton and Dr. Leedt,

to be released by the Secretary

, News of Russia's entry 
into the war with Japan 
touched off widespread re- 
joicing among soldiers and 
civilians and fui-ther height- 
ened expectations of quick 
ending of the war. 

A few sleepy inhabitants, 
mostly newsmen^ heard the 
news shortly after four 
o'clock Thursday morning. 
By eight o'clock, newspaper 
extras told the stoi-y to thou- 
sands on their way to work. 

The news got an enthusias- 
tic reception as it spiead 
rapidly among American sol- 
diers and Filipinos. 

No one seemed to bave 
been surprised, as Russian 



participation in the Pacific 
conflict had been senerMy 
regarded >as inevitable fol- 
lowing Japan's rejection of 
the Potsdam nltimatum* 

The general opinion was 
that the Allies had given tbe 
Japs a terrific douole b.ow. 
People were still enthusiasti- 
cally discussing the effects of 
the atomic bomb when they 
heard the news Russia had 
joined the fight. 

The combination of these 
two forces might soon force 
the Japs to sue for peace, was 
the p-eneral belief. 

"That doesn't make me 
mad," said a GL '^That ought 
tn get us home a lot sooner^ 



The availability of Siberian 
bases to American air and sea 
forces was expected to add 
new power to the a. ready de- 
vastating attacks on the Jap- 
anese horne islands. 

President Osmena said: 
"This shows the strong 
spirit of solidarity among the 
United Nations. The impact 
of Russia's declaration of war 
is of such a convincin;? force 
that it places the end of the 
war in sight. 

"The Filipinos shc^ild be 
happy at this turn of events, 
and should expect the early 
realization of their aspirations 
for peace and inde pen^lence."

White Hot Flames Kindled at Hiroshima 
Leap Across 3-Block-Wide Fire Breaks 

GUAM — The atomic bomb kindled white fires that 
swept over Hiroshima in wide sti-eams to burn out more 
than four square miles in the heart of the city, it was

showed clearly that the heart 
of Hiroshima was wiped out 
with such thoroughness as if 
some giant bulldozer had swept 
across buildings and houses. 
Effect of the bomb, was so terri- 
fic that several man-made fire- 
breaks and seven streams failed 
to stop the fires. One of the 
firebreaks was three city blocks 
wide, and a photograph evaluator 
said "It was one of the best seen 
in Japan. If ever a firebreak 
should have stopped flames it 
should have done so in this 
case." 

U. S. Army Strategic Air 
Foi'ces experts said there was 
no comparison between fire 



caused by the atomic bomb and 
that of a normal conflagration. 
They pointed out that when Yo- 
hilhoma was burned by normal 
fire, it looked as if smoke pots 
were burning thi'oughout the 
city. In the case of Hiroshima 
a white plume rose thousands of 
feet in the air. At the base of 
this high-necked mushroom 
there was a cloud like an accu- 
mulation believed to be dust 
blown into the air by the tre- 
mendous concussion. 
: Although additional damage 
was noted outside the complete- 
ly destroyed section, the camera 
reveaVed that the lower part of 
Hiroshima citv and its harbor 
and dock facilities appeared to 
I be barely touched by the tre-

Tokyo Says All Life Seared 
To Death In Hiroshima Blast 

SAN FRANCISCO— A Tokyo broadcast m Engbs 
yesterday said that "with gradual restoration cu orck 
following the disastrous ruin that struck the city o 
Hiroshi'ma in the wake of the enemy's new type bom 
on Monday morning, authorities are still unable 
obtain a definite check-up of casualties sustamedjoy th 
civilian population," according to reports of i-adera 

monitors ^here. 

"Medical relief agencies that 
were rushed from neighboring 
districts were unable to distin- 
guish, less identify the dead 
from the injured," the broad- 
cast continued. 

"The impact of the bomb was 
so terrific that practically all 
living things, human and ani- 
mals were literally seared to 
death by the tremendous heat 
and pressure engendered by the 
blast. All of the dead and in- 
jured were burned beyond 
recognition. 

"With houses and buildings 
crushed, including emergency 
medical .:ftcilities. authorities 
are having their hands full in 
giving every available relief 
possible under the circumstan- 
ces. 

"The effect of the bomb was 
widespread. Those outdoors 
were burned to death, while 
those indoors were killed by 
indescribable pressure and 
heat." 

The Tokyo GEA news serv- 
ice, describing the tremendous 
destruction of the new terror 
weapon, eaid: "During the 
morning of August sixth the 
greater part of Hiroshima city 
was destroyed by the enemy 
from his raid, in which a new 
type of bomb was employed. 
The number of dead and 
wounded within the city has 
reached a staggering total. 

"The damage wrought by this 
new bomb is tremendous. 
Grewsome sights,, resulting 
from the might of this new 
bomb, cannot be truly de-

''Military arrangemeftts made

Soviet Union declared war on

agreed to enter the war in the

Referring to the joint V^S»,

UNSUNG CRAFTSMEN OF VICTORY 

One of rhe most under-publicized stones of this war has 
been the? ach;evements of patrol airmen of the MacArthur com- 
nrrand in reducing Japan to her present impotence. 

Flying daily over the greatest stretch of sea and land mass 
that exists in any war theater, the exploits of these air-borne 
"brooms" which swept the seas clean of Japanese shipping, 
have been hidden under a mass of dull statistics, overshadowed 
by the dratnatic: of an dl-omic bomb, or forgotten in the flush 
of victory upon victory. 

Day after day, through foul and fair weather, they have 
been methodically picking off tankers, luggers, sampans, trans- 
ports, rowboats, rafts — anything which the Japanese have been 
able to float. Day after day, they take off from bases in the 
Philippines, New Guinea, the Indies and Okinawa. Theirs Is 
the monotonous job of pinning down the enemy where he is, to 
rob him of mobility, to starve his outpost garrisons, and to 
starve homeland furnaces and warehouses. Only half the story 
is told when communiques reveal that since the first of this 
year, 2,846,932 tons of Japanese shipping had been sent to the 
bottom by patrolling airmen of Far East Air Forces and at- 
tached units sweeping every inch of water from Singapore ir 
the south to Japan's Inland Sea and the coasts of Korea. 

Their monotonous contribution has helped make possible 
Japan's strategic defeat — where she now is unable to defend 
herself, or strike out against her tormentors. Today, Japan is 
unable to move her stolen treasures from the south, or to 
supply her garrisons there with weapons from the homeland. 
Today, Japan is unable to shuttle troops and supplies even 
across the narrow waters separating the homeland and the 
fiewly-oF>ened Manchurlan front against Russia. 

Nor IS she able to evacuate those mainland armies — if mili- 
tary tactics dictate — to meet the growing threat of homeland 
invasion now massing under General MacArthur's wing In the 
western Pacific. 

Jape^n, whose very existence depended on her ability to 
travel and control the seas, who saw the sea as a wall of pro- 
tecfion, now finds it a broad, rolling carpet for her enemies, 
beckoning an invitation to Japan's home shores and the final 
battles. 

This, the bombardiers, the pilots, and the navigators have 
helped fashion, In their lonely missions across the broad expanse

Armor VestsV 
Flown to U.S. 
Pacific Units 

DETROIT — Armor 
'Vests,'' made of armor 
plate of a secret new *'non- 
ferrous'' alloy embodied in 
a canvas garment, are being 
flown to our infantrymen 
in the Pacific where they 
l^ave been in service for 
some time, it was revealed 
here Thursday. 

The ^'vests'* are being deliv- 
ered at the rate of more than 
85,000 sets a month, it was dis 
closed by the president of the 
company that makes them. 

The vest weighs 12 pounds 
and provides protection against 
^.he1\ fragments. 

Uncovers the fighter's chest, 
tvunk and back to the waist. 
When not in use it folds into 
a small bundle. Containing no 
steel or iron, the new alloy is 
tremendously strong and light. 

The body armor used by the 
air forces reduced casualties by 
60 percent, the Army said. 

Since 65 percent of all ground 
troop casualties are caused by 
shell fragments, considerable 
further reduction is expected 
with the new armor.

ported yesterday. 

The health bureau chief re- 
quested the establishment of 
social hygiene clinic and 10 
social hygiene hospitals in view 
of the increasing number of 
social diseases in the Philip- 
pines. For these hospitals, clin- 
ic and other activities of the

Eichelberger Sees 
Earlier War End 

Japan probably will surrender 
sooner than was previously ex- 
pected, Lt. Gen. Robert L. 
Eichelberger, commander of the 
U. S. Eighth Army, obsei-ved 
yesterday. 

"Russia's decision and action, 
coupled with the possibilities of 
the new atomic bomb, changes 
the surrender of Japan from 
possibility to probability. Even 
the most fanatical Japanese 
warloi'ds must realize the game 
is up, with the whole world ar- 
rayed against them. 

"All Americans hope that 
these new events will force an 
early surrender, yet our fight- 
ing men stand ready, if neces- 
sary, to continue the destruction 
of the Japanese forces," he con- 
cluded.

Wedemeyer Confers With 
Russian Military Aides 

CHUNGKING— Lt. Gen. Albert C. Wedemeyer, 
commander of the U. S forces in the China theater, 
yesterday conferred with Russian military represen- 
tatives shortly after Russia's war declaration against 
Japan was announced. 

Korea has been included in the China theater, 
together with China proper, Manchuria, and Indo- 
China, it was disclosed simultaneously with Wede- 
meyer's meeting with the Russians. ^ 

The disclosure coincided with authentic reports 
•that U. S. trained and equipped Chinese paratroopers 
already are being us<3d behind Japanese lines in China. 



The J apanese were 
denounced as aggressors 
"had long time designs

decisive war theory "When

• Highlight of general Russ .

Luise Guyon Wetzchler, There- 
sa Reingold, Wolfram Seiver, 
Klaus SchiUing, Hans Heinrich 
Lammers, chief of the chancel^ 
lery staff; and Wini Frick, 
known as the "protector of 
Bohemia and Moravia." 

The ahove will include al- 
most all of the former Get- 
man leaders still alive. 

Only two of the defendants 
were members of Hitler's cabi- 
net — Goering and Von Ribben- 
trop. The latter engineered the 
Russian-German treaty and ac- 
cording to Sir Neville Hender- 
son's ''Failure of Mission," was, 
next to Hitler, most responsible 
for the attack on Poland and 
the start of the war. 

Rosenberg occupied an im- 
portant place in Hitler's 
councils. He was one of the 
exponents of the geopolitics 
taught by Gen. Karl Haushof- 
f er» now held by the Russians, 
and has the reputation of be- 
ing the author of many of 
Germany's "racial" doctrines. 
The inclusion of Von Papery 
occasioned some surprise. Fol- 



lowing his capture in western 
Germany during the Allies final 
offensive, it was believed, by 
some responsible sources, that 
he had covered his trail so cun- 
ningly that it would be almost 
impossible to find evidence 
against him. 

Since then, conversations 
concerning the war, in one of 
which Von Papen advocated 
mass starvation as a method of 
breaking resistance in occupied 
countries have come to light, in 
addition to important docu- 
ments. 

Streicher was one of the 
original members of the party, 
and as gauleiter of Franconia 
was famous for his hatred of 
Jews and for his brutality. 

Remission on 1945 
Taxes Is Suggested 

The administrative division 
of the department of the inte- 
rior has recommended to the 
office of the President the re- 
mission of 19A taxes on real 
properties destroyed during the 
war, it was learned yesterday. 

A proportionate reduction 4n 
the taxes of properties partly 
damaged during the war was 
also recommended. This would 
require a reassessment of 
^properties affected.

Slowly Starve to Death 



I News Briefs 



PELELIU, PALAU IS- 
LANDS — Marine aircraft, fly- 
ing out of this two-by-ten- 
mile island as often as five 
times daily on missions over 
enemy-held northern Palaus, 
are proving that the Japanese 
on by-passed islands can be 
starved by air action, a de- 
layed dispatch to the N. Y. 
Times reported on Tuesday. 

Brig. Gen. C. G. Schlit, 
U. S. Marine Corps, Palau Is- 
land commander, / surmises 



that many Japanese in the 
northern Palaus must be dy- 
ing daily of starvation as a 
result of the persistent fire 
bombing of all likely garden 
plots around their uneasy 
homes. 

Occasional prisoners, picked 
up by American patrol craft 
along the coral reefs of the 
Palau chain, show physical 
ravages of malnutrition, al- 
though these islands are lush 
with Vegetation. 



More Secrets To Come • . . 



Continued from 
Front Page 



dropped on war industries, and 
urged Japanese civilians to 
leave industrial cities to save 
themselves from destruction. 

Truman said that the Allied 
had felt compelled to undertake 
the long, uncertain and costly 
discovery and production of the 
atomic bomb because the ene- 
my was known to be searching 
for it, and **we knew the disas- 
ter which would come to this 
nation, to all peaceful nations, 
to all civilization if they had 
found it first." 

"Having found the bomb 
we have used it against those 
who attacked us without 
warning at Pearl Harbor, 
against those who have 
starved and beaten and exe- 
cuted U. S. prisoners of 
war — against those who 
have abandoned all pretense 
of obeying international laws 
of warfare. We shall conti- 
nue to use it until we com- 
pletely destroy Japan's power 
to make war. Only a Jap- 
anese surrender will stop us." 
The President stated that al- 
though the U. S. v/ants no ter- 
ritory or profit or selfish ad- 
vantage out of the war, "we are 
going to maintain military bases 
necessary for the complete 
protection of our interests and 
of world peace." He added 
that bases which the U. S. does 
not now possess and which it 
considers necessary for its pro- 
tection, will be acquired **by 
arrangements consistent with 
the United Nations Charter." 

Truman repeated his assur- 
ance that the Berlin Conference 
made no secret agreements or 
commitments apart from cur- 
rent military operations, and 
stated that the **most impor- 
tant item" in the minds of the 
U. S. delegation *'was winning 
the war against Japan." He 
also declared that the new 
council of foreign ministers of 
the five principal governments 
is to lay the groundwork for 
future peace settlements just as 
the Dumbarton Oaks meeting 
drew up the proposals to be 
placed before the San Francisco 
Conference. 

In listing the political and 
economic principles with which 
the United Nations hone to 
''make Germany over into a 
decent nation," the President 
declared that the purpose of re- 
parations is to retake out of 
Germany everything with which 
she can prepare for another 
war and to help devastated 
countries to bring about their 
own recovery by means of 
equipment and material taken 
from Germany." 

In describihg European 
w^Yervvays as ''one of the per- 
sistent causes for wars 5n the 



last two centuries," Truman re- 
vealed that the U. S. had pro- 
posed to the Berlin Conference 
that they be placed under the 
jurisdiction of international 
agencies to develop their use 
and assure equal treatment of 
them for all nations. He said 
this proposal has been referred 
to the new council of *'Big Five" 
foreign ministers for consider- 
ation.

towns and railway stations of 
Manchouli and Chalainor, just

In the Bor Lake region far- 
ther south, the Russians occu- 
pied two towns without en- 
countering resistance. 

Meanwhile the Soviet air 
force struck at three of Man- 
churia's principal railway junc- 
tions — at Harbin, Changchun 
(Hsinking) and Kirin — and at 
two ports in northern Korea — 
Seishin and Rashin, the com- 
munique said. 

American B-28's'laid mines 
off Rashin last week in their 
longest mine-laying operations. 
In Chungking, Lieut. Gen. 
A. C. Wedemeyer, command- 
er of American forces in 
China, said that United States 
bombers had been pounding 
Japanese troop movements 
northward preparatory for 
Russia's entry into the war 
against Japan. 

Wedemeyer also disclosed that 
American-trained Chinese war 
troops have gone into action 
against the Japanese for the 
first time. Parachutists last 
\yeek dropped on Japanese posi- 
tions near Hengyang, in Hunan 
province.

moves and wipe out the Jap-

The assault opened at dawn 
Thursday and was renew^ed 
with increasing fury yester- 
day. American press dis- 
patches said carrier aircraft 
lashed at hiding places of 
Japan's seriously depleted air 
force, w^hich had been hoard- 
ed for final defense of the 
homeland. 
American battleships, heavy 
cruisers and destroyers, joined 
by British light units, turned 
their heeLvy guns on the Jap 
mainland for the eighth time 
since July 14, 

Kamaishi, a city of 42,000 
on the northeastern Honshu 
coast, w^as wrecked by 1,000 
tons of shells from Admiral 
Halsey's powerful fleet force 
in the first bombardment of 
July 14. Thursday's second 
strike causctd extensive dam- 
age to steel mills. 

Press dispatches said a 
mighty armada of dive bomb-, 
ers, torpedo planes and fight- 
ers swept over Honshu. Pre- 
liminary reports by air observ- 
ers indicated considerable dam- 
age was inflicted on steel mill 
installations but complete re- 
ports were not yet known. 

During operations off Ka- 
maishi, United States destroy- 
ers sank one small freighter- 
transport and three small ves- 
sels. Japanese countered with 
light artillery fire but, accord- 
ing to Admiral Nimitz's latest 
communique, "our forces suf- 
fered no casualties." 

Nimitz gave no indication of 
results of Thursday's carrier 
sweeps. Associated Press cor- 
respondents with Halsey's fleet 
reported, however, that pilots 
said they knocked out scores 
of Japanese planes, mostly on 
the gi-ound, and set fir»e to 
ground installations.

' ■ LET THEM NOT FORGET 

As Ihc moz\ costly war Is passing Into history, It Is well there 
relaxoiion, rejoicing and celebration, as well as humble pray- 
^,5 of ihanksgiying. But as peoples rejoice, let them not for- 
get why this v,^ar was fought, why young men died, why peoples 
endured privation, suffering, and denial to make this victory 
possible. 

And let them not forget that cessation of hostilities alone 
does not destroy the basic reasons which pitted man against 
man and nation against nation. 

A great victory will have been won. But there are still forces 
of greed, intolerance, and reaction alive in every country, 
victor and vanquished alike. Today. In view of developments 
in the battlcfronts. it is no longer fashionable to appear public- 
ly as Fascist. But that does not mean that Fascism is dead. 
M', roots have spread deeply beneath the surface, ready to 
rocppear should there be fertile breeding ground at some 

future time. , , . k, , 

No one is too old to forget that World War No. 1 was 
fought to "make the world safe for democracy." But victory 
achieved on the battlefield was dissipated in wranglings of the 
peace table and the international mistrust which fol.owed. 

Instead, the world In 1939. through cartels, monopolies, 
and the "lofs-do-business-wIth-HItler" clique, had never be- 
come so unsafe for the democratic way of life. The world saw 
the Idea of authoritarian rule reach Its apex in the years Fol- 
lov/ing the war to "make the world safe for democracy." 

That is why today, mixed with elation, must be sober re- 
flection on what should and must be done to preserve this 
hord-won victory. Yesterday's tragedy lies before man as a 
qiiidepost for tomorrow. 

President Truman described the recent triumph in Europe 
as "a victory of one way of life over another." 

There must be ho wholesale rush to forget the awfulness, 
and the horror of war.' Now is the time ro remember, and to 
n-ctintain constant vigilance against the time-honored enemies 
of our way of life. -

Army Abandons Use of Sulfa 
Tablets to Treat War Wounds 



WASHINGTON— The U. S. 
Army has abandoned the is- 
sue of powdered suKanila- 
mide to soldiers for emergen- 
cy first aid application to 
wounds, also eight sulfa 
tablets which soldiers were 
supposed to take internally, 
press services reported here 
Friday. 

Sulfa tablets, while they 
killed some infectious germs, 
failed to halt decomposition 
of flesh, which furnished the 
material in which blopd poi- 
soning ultimately might de- 



velop. The powders were a 
foreign body in wounds,

mie Bomb Report: 

Atomic Bomb Which Hits Nagasaki 
Makes First Missile 'Obsolete' 

GUAM— The second atomic bomb dropped on Japan ut Nagasaki was so much 
more exi>lQi5ive than the one which hit Hi roshima that it immediately relegated to 
obsolete the first type of atomic weapon, Gen. Thomas P. Parrell, he^d of the atomic 
bcmb project in tlie Pacific, announced Saturday. 

Atomic bomb No. 2 was not only far more potent but was also eai^ier to make, 
Farreli asserted. He watched both bomb higs and declared the blast from the second 



was far greater 

Rear Admiral William Pur- 
neU, naval representative on 
the project, said the *'bomb 
dropped on Nagasaki made the 
bomb dropped on Hiroshima 
obsolete." 

Super Fort crews who car- 
ried bombs to Japan, and scien- 
tists who helped create hhem, 
described terrible effects ot the 
weapon which helped to bring 
the petice offer from the Jap- 
anese. 

Major Charles Sweeney, who 
commanded the plane carrying 
the deadlier type of bomb to 
Nagasaki, declafed: 

"You could feel the shock 
and the gresit turbulence, just 
as if we had been hit by Jlak. 
It was more severe than in the 
Hiroshima attack." 

He also told of the towering 
pillar of smoice preceded by 
the blinding flash over the city 
as the bomb struck. 

The soeond atomic bomb was 
aimed at a specific target In 
Nagasaki-^the Mitsubishi steel 
works— and resulted in a;bijlli[- 
oyot Captain Kermit Beahan, 
the bombardier disclosed. Re- 
connaissance photos shov/ed 
two of the Mitsubishi plants 
were demolished. 

The two atoinie missiles were 
dropped in the same manner 
as an ordinai^y bomb, except 
for minor differences, Beahan 
revealed.

30 Percent of Nagasaki 
Atomized by New Bomb 

GUAM — Thirty pei^cent of Nagasaki, including 
almost all of its industrial district, was destroyed by 
Thursday's atomic bombint^ Gen. Carl A. Spaatz, U. S, 
commander of Strategic Air Forces, announced Satur- 
day. 

The irregular nature of Nagasaki's built up area^ 
extending like fingers up the low valleys, had some

trated area of Hiroshima where the bomb wiped out a 

krge part of the city.

TERMS TO JAPAN 



' Yc^.terdciy 5 lead editorial from the New York Times de- 
scribes the Four-Power answer to Japan's cleverly-worded sur- 
render offer a5 "a wise and stafesman-lilce decision" which ''holds 
oyt every prospect tor a quick end to the war, without relm- 
qgishing any essential aims for which our soldiers fought," 
The editorial said; 

"On ih face, the Japanese offer was so tempting that 
the Hi it impube of every p^^ce loving being must have been 
tp accept it. For with the sole reservation regarding the Em-, 
psfor, the Japanese accepted Allied terms in full and offered 
tc abandon everything they had won, stolen, and stood for 
since Commodore Perry. 

. ■ 'Mt was the solemn duty of the Allies to see to It that the 
Japanese offer contained no hidden dynamite. It was their 
d^ty io guard against traditional Japanese treachery, the possi- 
b tlty of which was again emphasized by the fact for the long 
hours after making it, Japaness authorities kept the surrender 
secret from fheir own people, 

"It was the Allied duty to safeguard our war objectives 
and to prevent nulllflcatioi^ of the Potsdam terms bv trickery 
or language which the Japanese are ever prone. The Allied 
answer fulfills both duties admirably. It makes plain beyond 
any doubt or quibbling that from the moment of surrender, an 
A^-ipd supreme commander, who will be an American, will rule 
Japan, and that the Japar-^se emperor and government are 
both subject to his orders. The emperor in particular is re- 
qii'red to give imperial sanction to the surrender document 
v Sch puts it on par with a divine command and beyond chal- 
le-go by any Japanese and to issue personal commands to 
J^p^nese miliiviiy, naval and a^ authorities to lay down their 
arms, w4ilch Gvery Japanese nust obey." 

More importantly , the Times points out, the Allied answer 
Also ^roWdes that the ultimata form of government for Japan 
sfi^ii be ostabilshcd by the freely eitpressed will of the Japan- 
ese people. 

othwi words^ the Allied answer expressly transfers the 
rights, of sovereignty from the emperor to the Japanese people, 
making!. them ir»asters of th^lr own fate for the first time in 
their- lortg hf^itotv/' the Times c onclu des, ^

Boys Practicing 
Car Watch Racket 

The "watch your" car" 
racket, which was at its worst 
during the few months pre-' 
cedin^g the outbreak of the 
war is again being practiced 
in Manila, especially around 
night clubs. Civilian cars as 
well as military vehicles, 
v/ith the exception of cars 
used by the Military Police, 
are hounded by the '"watch 
your car" -boys. 

As a ear is parked, a boy 
approaches the driver and 
volunteers his services to 
watch the car while the driv- 
er i?j away. This is especially 
true with car owners who 
drive their own cars. When 
the car owner is not agree- 
able to the idea, something 
always happens to his car in 
his absence. A tire is punc- 
tured or some movable parts 
missed.

Foreign Policy Growth Under 
Late Roosevelt Is Outlined ^ 

WASHINGTON— The outstanding feature of ih^ 
■ 12-year presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt is that lb- 
a S during those vears "reached a new comprehension 
of its vast military and industrial power and of the t^pc sd 
for developing a foreigr^i policy compatible with t,uu 
powPT and the country's commanding position in ihc 
woild/' a foreign policy report, prepared by Washin.?tnn 
Director Blair Bollcs, disclosed yesterday.

*Trcsidcnt Roosevelt pomted 
hit by bit the way he thoii^ht 
the ti- S. ou^'ht to follow. Once 
the public was followinpr the 
trail he had blamed, he let the 
people be his ^^uide. 

"To provide for th^ nation's 
e'^ouritv the United States, 'he- 
fore Roosevelt's death, had 
spread its stationery lines of 
defense far across both o<Vjans. 

'politically, the United States 
.^treng-thened old and acquired 

new soheres of special interest. 

By the Act of Chanultepec 

adopted at the Mexico City con-

V/ ASHINGTON — The U S 
C3-overnnient's war procurement 
agencies have begun to cancel 
wsr contracts to the greatest 
extent possible to free mate- 
rials for reconversion, it was 
announced yesterday by John 
Vv'. Snyder, Director of War 
:^'icbilization and Reconversion. 
Ke added cutbacks were not the 
"result of the Japanese sur- 
render offer" but resulted from 
reviews of war procurement 
programs held during tho past 
few weeks. 

Snyder 
scheduled 

with shipbuilding contractors to 
give details on constrLiction cut- 
backs which are expected to 
total $1,200,000,000. He said 
\he Army will also make a 
sharp reduction in its buying 
pr'^gram immediately. 

The War Production Board, 
S'^.yder said, will direct released

said the Navy has 
a series of meetings 



production as rapidly as these 
cutbacks permit, while the War 
Manpower Commission will ad- 
just its facilities to handle re- 
employment problems, as the 
nation's factories make the 
shift from war to civilian

vincing proof that Japan's war mak- 
ing power is destroyed."

Unit 



WEB Of DARKNESS 

If ever the world needed an object lesson on the tragic 
conoequences of withholding news and information fronn people, 
it con be found in Japan. 

The world witnessed the sorry spectacle orf a Japanese 
nation fumbling toward a decision it had been fdrced to make, 
with 80,000,000 people, unaware of what had happened until 

fhe last minu^o. - / , . . , ,/ , 

Not a word ho^Jrbeqh^ addressed to the Japanese peopl^ 
infoiming them of JaR^*^si^paace ne:gotiations ^ith the Allies. 
Today, when Jap^-s-^Uaders needed; the utmcjst support and 
good faith of theiff people 'they darepi not tell|them tfte truth. 
Japan's leaders W9re^ciaught- in a web of their lown making. 

The Japanese peof^le wer^ not told of th^ horrendbus los- 
ses suffered in the %iltpfiine^. They were rjot told the full 
story of Atfu, Kisl<d...Kwaiaiein, New Guinea, Borneo, Okinawa, 
or Iwo Jima. They were not +old the full stpry of America's, 
war effort, of America's naval strength, of Japan's air losses, 
and her fleel- and merchant nr^arine fiascos. That is why the 
Japanese people could not be told that Japan's position was 
so grave that surrender was the only way out. 

Even until two days ago. Japanese still were told their 
navy was scoring victories, their air forces still were nriaking 
damaging inroads into the enemy, ^heir ground forces in the 
Asia, in the Pacific islands still were gaining 



Philippines, m 

ground. ^ 

So, as Japan faced her darkest hour, Japan s leaders were 
compelled to Issue only a w'thering barrage of exhortations 
and appeals. The main theme centered upon a hodge- 
podge of mysticism and tradition. The Japanese could be 
to!cl only to maintain quiet and order, and to obey the Em- 
peror'G coinmand, no matte*- **^hat he should say. 

It is a fitting end \o a form of government based on fear, 
violence, and Enslavement. And it should serve as an example 
to the world that among the first requisites to permanent 
peace must be freedom of speech and expression.

Halsey, in a press interview 
shortly after the Japanese

praise to all American forces 
as well as those serving under 
him. 

His demeanor was strange-

bute to the men of his com- 
mand who served through the 
long, gruelling war. 

"Fve no words to describe 
my admiration for the men 
of this force, the very splen- 
did Americans who have 
worked With me during near- 
ly four years of this war. 

"As long as the United 
Nations can produce men of 
this type — which it shall con- 
tinue to do — we've nothing to 
fear," Halsey said.

TALKING IT. OVER — President framan- and Secretary of State 
Byrnes, pictured, above, have been discussing the new Japanese 
ansiver to unconditional surrender ivhich may possibly mean the 

end of the war. 

World Counts 23,000,000 
Casualties at Wa/s End 

The end of the world-wide war marks the close of 
an enormous conflict in which almost 23,000,000 were 
killed or wounded in combat — not counting millions 
killed by starvation, air raids and other causes. 

Japan was completely overwhelmed by new weapons 
and new methods of global strategy — a movable stra- 
tegic air force of 100 aircraft carriers. 

Japan's military clique, which had chosen to lead 
the Japanese people into what amounted to national 
suicide, has been smashed. 

Admira. Osoroku Yamamoto<$^ 
once boasted that he would dic- 
tate peace terms in the White 
House but that boast, along with 
the Greater East Asia Co-Pros- 
perity Sphere, the Reich of a 
thousand years, the New Order, 
Mussolini's million bayonets 
and a new Roman Empire stand 
today as empty vain glories. 
. The United States, though 
tested by the most humiliating 
defeats of her history, also won 
some of her greatest victories. ^ 

Fighting tw^o great wars si- 
multaneously, she won them both 
and now emerges upon .a new 
stage of world power, her arniies 
of occupation spanning two 
oceans. • 

But ivictory was costly, costly 
in huge American cemeteries 
strewm across the map of the 
world. New names such as 
Bataan, Faid Pass, Corregidor, 
Salerno, Guadalcanal, Anzio, 
Coral Sea, ^Cassino, Midway, 
Tarawa, Saint Lo, Saipan, 
Tinian, Aachen, Iwo Jima, the 
Rhine, Okinawa, the Ardennes, 
and countless others can never 
be • forgotten by surviving 
Americans. 



Jail Now Houses 
Top Nazi Criminals 

NUERNBU5.G, GERMANY— 
Nuernburg's city jail, with its 
bare cells, now houses notorious 
Nazi leaders such as Hermann 
Goering, Joachim Van Ribben- 
trop and Robert Ley who will 
go on trial as major war 
criminals next month. 

Battery B ot the U. S. 391st 
Anti- Aircraft' Artillery which 
has been guarding these leaders 
at the Luxembourg Hotel, com- 
pleted the move to the jail yes- 
terday. 

The troops threw a strong 
guard around the prison. 

The Nazis were housed in the 
west wing of the jail, w^hich is 
separated from the main sec- 
tion of the prison by a 48 ft. 
board wall. 

German civilians awaiting 
trial are kept in the main sec- 
tor.

"Tt was from this port that 
the Japanese invaders sent 
to their islands convoys with 
loot seized in Korea. 

"The landing on Yuki was 
mr-de by a group of ships that 
w- s divided into two parties. 
At sea the landing troops 
were met by a strong storm and 
a dense fog greatly restriot- 
ed visibility. Even through the 
fog they saw clouds of fires left 
bv the bombs of Soviet f.iers 
vvhich unerringly signaled the 
way for our marines."

Atomic Energy To Be

WASHINGTON— The possi-

atomic energy can be used for 
industrial purposes was pre- 
dicted yesterday by Sir James 
Chadwick, chief scientific ad- 
viser to British members of the 
Allied committee which de- 
veloped the atomic bomb. He 
also declared that any nation 
can learn the secret of the ato- 
mic bomb in about five years 
of experimentation, assuming it 
has access to the necessary raw 
materials. 

It was reported by the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce here 
yesterday, that the new atomic 
discovery would not immediate- 
ly revolutionize industry nor 
replace other sources of energy 
now in use.

Berlin Parties Acknowledge 
Germany^ s Guilt for Hitler 

BERLIN — Berlin's four political parties have una- 
nimously supported a resolution which acknowledged 
Germany's collective guilt for the Hitler regime. 

The resolution, offered by a trade union represen- 
tative, was passed in the first public ''united front'' 
meeting of the four political parties Sunday. 



The resolution pledged an 
honest attempt to fulfill the 
spirit and letter of the Potsdam 
decisions of the United States, 
Britain and Russia. It also called 
for continuation of a united 
front to achieve Germany's next 
generation and pledged elimi- 
naticJn of militarism, reaction- 
arism and Nazism. 

Communist leader Wilhelm 
Pieck observed that no German 
would deny the Potsdam terms 



were hard but that they must 
be loyally met. "The whole 
German character must be re- 
made,'* he said. 

Wilhelm Kuelz, minister of 
interior in the old Weimar 
Republic, presided and termed 
the four political parties "edu- 
cators of the nation for demo- 
cracy." 

Berlin's Mayor Arthur Wer- 
ner spoke in support of the re- 
solution. 



Authorize Back 
Pay for Employes 

President Osmena yesterday 
appointed a three-man commit- 
tee to study ways and means of 
paying *'back salaries'' to gov- 
ernment employes during three 
years of Jap occupation. This 
step v^as authorized by a joint 
resolution of Philippine Con- 
gress. 

The committee is composed 
of Ismael Mathay, commission- 
er of the budget; Marciano del 
Rosario, auditor. Agricultural 
and Industrial Bank; and Ma- 
riano Gonzales, of the civil 
service commission. 

Members of the Senate 
tangled in debate over the ques- 
tion of v^hether employes who 
served in the puppet republic 
should be given back pay. A 
compromise agreement was 
reached with insertion of the 
words "deserving employes," 
leaving it up to the committee 
to determine who the deserving 
ones are.

Declares National Onily 
Essential as War Ends 

President Osmena has called for a united front 
among the Filipinos in face of sudden ending of the war 
and impending Philippine independence. 

''National unity is absolutely essential,'' he declared, 
^'the more so because of the sudden end of the war." 

Addressing a joint session of Philippine Congress 

^yesterday, the President 

said :

fronted with the first and most 
difficult phases of rehabilita- 
tion and recon^struction, made 
even raorc coroplex by the pro- 
blems attendant on the establish- 
ment of our independence.*' 

The defeat of Japan, Osmena 
declared, has removed one of the 
greatest obstacles to the grant 
of Philippine independence. 

"No longer need the Philip- 
pines tremble for her existence 
and her national integrity,*' he 
averred. 

"Having scaled with her blood 
a ppct of honor with America 
providing for the mutual protec 
tion of both countries,- Filipino 
democracy has a secure place 
under the sun and shall remain 
one of the principal bastions for 
the preservation of permanent 
universal peace.

*Taced with the problem of 
rfiding the Chief Executive in 
girding the nation for a con- 
iict of unprecedented propor- 
tions, he accomplished his task 
v\'jth exceptional skill. 

"His sympathetic considera-

Stalin^ 
Expressions 

MOSCOW— Gen. Dwight D. 
Eisenhower, visiting Russia at 
the invitation of Generalissimo 
Stalin, said yesterday Stalin 
had told him that American- 
Soviet friendship "must be per- 
petuated." 

Eisenhower, who * received 
the plaudits of Russians of all 
ranks on his visit here, told 
the Generalissimo that in com- 
ing to Moscow he hoped to "im- 
plement the friendship between 
the two countries," eliciting 
Stalin's reply that "This friend- 
ship must be perpetuated." 

Eisenhower explained he had 
not halted his troops at the 
Elbe, or anywhere else last

dship 



"^^pring, because the Red Army 
or Stalin made such a request. 

He said the reason' American 
troops stopped at the Elbe, 
short of Berlin, was because he 
wanted to break up Hitler's re- 
doubt in the south as fast as 
possible. 

His orders to commanders 
were to halt at the Elbe at cer- 
tain places and turn southward 
at others with all speed pos- 
sible. 

Eisenhower disclosed that 
these orders were given weeks 
ahead of the time, and he as- 
serted it never was his plan to 
halt at any military or politic- 
al zone. 



GUAM — The communicati()^'.^• 
•room of Pacific Fleet headqur^r- 
ters flashed word over the Guam 
Radio at 3:58 p.m. yesterday 
that Tokyo had broadcast an 
announcement that. the messa^^ie 
accepting the Potsdam Dechwa-. 
tion would be forthcoming soon. 

W'^ves of cheering were 
'lenrd as tbowsai^ds of soldiers, 
'tailors, and marines heard the 
-^ev^s. Guam's radio repeated 
the Tokyo report several times. 
No Allied source had yet con- 
fii-med the news. 



The Free Philippines and the 
Office of War Information radio 
gave IManilans their first news 
of Japan's acceptance of the 
Allied nations surrender terms. 

Free Philippines' blazing 
crimson headlines "It's All 
Oveil" was on the street at 3:07 
p.m. The paper, a model of 
extra making, consisted of four 
news and feature-packed pages, 
with excellent half tone pic- 
tures of highlighted figures and 
incidents of the war. The total 
Dress run of the extra was 
45,000 copies. 

Speed, and accuracy scored 
the greatest news beat for Free 
Philippines. From the time 
OWI monitors flashed the news 
to the OWI editorial rooms at 
2:52 p.m. it required but 11 
minutes to get first printed copy 
of the paper oh Manila's stree^ts. 

The OWI radio voice, pro- 
^'laiming Japan's acceptance of 
Allied surrender terms, was 
heard simultaneously with the 
-^pnearance of the extra. A 
mobile truck, equipped with 
^^udspeakers, sped through 
Manila's streets blaring the joy- 
ful news. 



2 More Federal 
Agencies Opened 

The national government has 
revived two more government 
corporations as another step 
toward rehabilitation and re- 
construction of local trade and 
industry.

MacArthur Orders Japs 
To End All Hostilities 

Representatives of Japan's land, sea and air forces will meet 
with General MacArthur in Manila late this week to receive re- 
quirements for Japan's unconditional surrender, it was revealed 
last night. 

In his second message as supreme commander of Allied 
powers, General MacArthur directed the Japanese government by 
radio to send "to his headquarters in Manila a competent rejpro- 
sentative empowered to receive in the name of the Emperor of 
Japan, the Japanese imperial government, and Japanese Genei 
Headquarters, requirements for carrying into effect terms of

Americans Fill Streets, Sing, 
Shout, Dance, Weep as War Ends 

SAN FRANCISCO— The people of America celebrated the end of the war last 
night in unprecedented fashion. 

In the great cities throughout the length and breadth of the country, people 
poured into the streets — sang, shouted, blew horns and built bonfires, danced, em- 
braced each other and wept. Strangers ki ssed each other and old enemies shook 
hands. Others went soberly to church to give thanks for peace. 

In towns and hamlets and on farms, the celebration 
was quieter but no less joyous and heartfelt. 

The streets of New York were covered with tons of 
ticker tape and paper.^ In Times Square, a crowd of 
150,000 which had almost lost heart during the long wait 
for official news of victory, swelled quickly to half a 
million when news finally came.

Manchurian Grab Fbre shadows 
Entire Jap Dream of Conquest 



THE JOB AHEAD 

* A h'.n'f of fhe dlff.'culf task v/n'ch lies ahead of General 
MacArlhur'c occupation forces in the homeland of Japan can 
be gleaned from yesterday's Imperial Rescript read to the Jap- 
anese by Emperor Hirohito. The rescript reveals how twisted 
and contorted Japan's thinking has become under centuries of 
restriction, and underscores how much mental deadwood will 
have to be cleared away before the Japanese people can com- 
prehend and work our a free society. 

Historically, the rescript is one of the most complicated, 
obtuse, apologetic blurbs of mystical double-talk that has ever 
flowed from the pen of man. .But beneath the babble lies a 
shrewdly-contrived line of thinking which has permeated Jap- 
anese mental gymnastics since the Land of the Rising Sun first 
dreamed of world conquest and charted an aggressive course for 
its people. 

Hirohito, in his address to the people of Japan, S3/s some 
amazing thin^ijs. He declared that Japan declared war "out of 
our sincere desire to ensure Japan's self-preservation" and to 
stabilize East Asia. He declared that Japan sought neither "to 
infringe upon the sovereignty of other nations or to embark upon 
territorial aggrandizement." 

Emperor Hirohito expresses "deep regret to our Allied 
nations of East Asia, who have consistently cooperated with the 
Empire towards the emancipation of East Asia." 
** Outside of the fact that none of these statements coincide 
with Japan's action in grabbing hunks of China, indo-China, 
Burma, Malaya, the Philippines, the Indies, and are so obviously 
false as to merit no answer, the greater danger lies In the per- 
petuation of Japan's main propaganda theme throughout the 
war— that Japan's roU was f-hat of savior for Asia's millions 
agcinst the Occidental world. 

But even more dangerous Is Hirohlto's declaration that n 4. I ^ 1— I iJ 
Japan decided to capitulate to prevent "total extinction of! UsnTal Vc^fOUp neaO 
'human civilization." Measured against fact, against Japanese 
actions m Nanking and Manila, it is difficult for non-Japanese 
'rhinds to picture Japan in a role of "defender of civilization." 

The truth Is that Japan was defeated— militarily, politically, 
and economically. She was beaten on the ground, In the air 
and in the sea. Japan was herded into such an inescapable 
trap, strategically and tactically, fhat there was no other course 
than unconditional surrender. Any other version is utter false- 
hood. 

And herein lies America's main job in the o-cupaHon of 
rc^apan. To the people of Japan, who have been withheld facts, 
information and news, and spoonfed only claptrap and lies, the 
story of Japan's full war guilt, her complete defeat on the battle- 
field,, the seas and ^he skies, and the tragic consequences of 
raping and pillaging her neighbors must be told and rehold until 
the youngest Japanese child is familiar with his country's record. 
Then, and then only, can a new Japan arise to take her place 
among a family of free nations. _

Japan first gained a toehold 
in Manchuria v/hen she obtained 
the territory of Kwantung, 
southernmost Manchuria, as 
part of the spoils of the Russo- 
Japanese war of 1904-5. 

Japan staged the Mukden in- 
cident in China on September 
18, 1931, and in a surpri-^e at- 
tack the Japanese army over- 
ran China's three northeastern 
provinces. She seized the ad- 
joining province of Jehol, in 
1933. 

Manchukuo, as Japan's new 
empire was called, had an area 
of more than 500,000 square 
miles, and a population of near- 
ly 40,000,000. 

Emperor Henry Pu Yi, boy 
Manchu ruler of China, who 
was overthrown in the Chinese 
revolution of 1911, was installed 
as the puppet head of Manchu- 
kuo. 

With Manchurian holding's 
consolidated, Japan staged an- 
other '^incident" at the . Marco 
Polo bridge, near Peipinc, on 
the night of July 7, 1937. ' 

The Japanese army then 
swarmed into northern China on 
August 18, hostilities broke out 
in Shanghai, and Japan was 
boasting to the world she would 
"beat China to her knees in 
three months." 

Japanese troops occupied Nan- 
king in December of that year, 
and committed atrocities that 
shocked the civilized world. How- 
ever, China had succeeded in 
luring the foe into spreading 
war through the Yangtze Val- 
ley. 

The policy of defense in 
depth resulted in a long, bloody, 
and . unsuccessful venture for 
the Japanese, even though Jap- 
an dominated i^ortheastern 
China and the Tower Yangtze 
Valley by the end of 1938. 

Completing the seizure of 
main Chinese coastal porta in 
1939, Japan cut Free China off 
^rom the outside world, except 
for a dribble of supplies tor- 
tuously trucked over the Burma 
road. 

Yet the Jap drive in China 
bogged down in 1939. Chinese 
9:uerrillas harrassed Japanese 
nositions throughout the occu- 
nicd areas. And the overland 
route from Tokyo to Singapore, 
^he object of Japanese strategy 
"n China, remained another un- 
fulfilled dream. 

When France fell in 1940, 
^apan demanded and received 
from the Vichy the military 
control of Indo-China. Japan 
became a full-fledged Axis part- 
ner in September of that year. 

Early the following year, 
Thailand fell under Tokyo's 
dominion. 

Then to prevent interference 
with her design for the con- 
quest of southeast Asia. Aus- 
tralia, and the Pacific Islands 
Japan struck at Pearl Harbor.

livered her precious cargo safe- 
ly prior to the disaster. 

Traditionally the flagship of 
the powerful Fifth Fleet, the 
Indianapolis had been at Mare 
Island navy yard for repairs 
just before her last run. She

Truman Makes Public Acceptance Terms - 



(Continued from Front Page) 



The magnitude of the task 
was visioned by the President 
when he said shortly after an- 
nouncing Japan's surrender: 
**The emergency is as great as 
it was on December 7, 1941." 

The President disclosed that 
the draft was ended for all men 
over 28, that replacements for 
fighting services in the mean- 
time would come from those 
under 26, and that between 
5,000,000 and 5,500,000 men 
now in uniform would be 
turned back to civilian life in 
the next 12 or 18 months. 

Within a few hours of the 
announcement of Japan's sur- 
render, the U.S. War Manpower 
Commission called off all man- 
power controls. 

Within one hour of the sur- 
render, the U. S. Navy an- 
nounced the cancellation of 
$1,000,000,000 in prime war 
contracts. 



Chinese Ambassador 
Confers With Truman 

WASHINGTON— The Chinese 
Ambassador, Dr. Wei Tao-Ming 
conferred with President Tru- 
man yesterday following an 
earlier meeting with Secretary 
of State Byrnes. 

Dr. Wei said that he dis- 
cussed "actual problems cover- 
ing the postwar period" with 
the President. It was the first 
time the Chinese envoy had 
seen Truman since the latter 
become President. 



Kenney's Planes Destroy 
More Ships in Last Sweep 



In the final 48 hours of the 
v/ar, planes of General Ken- 
ney's Far East Air Forces de- 
stroyed more than 42,000 tons 
of enemy shipping and bagged 
19 enemy planes m raids on 
PJorea Tsushima Straits and 
the coasts of Kyushu. 

Attacks on land targets were 
suspended Monday, General 
MacArthur announced m com- 
munique number 1227 — the 
next to last communique of the 



war. 
In 



a sharp air 



fight 



over 



Honshu Tuesday, Seventh Air 
Force Thunderbolts knocked 
down 17 Jap interceptors while 
bombers sank or damaged a 
tanker, 12 freighters, five pat- 
rol boats, two anti-aircraft 
ships and a number of smaller 
craft. 

Seventh Fleet patrols sank 
an enemy freighter in the Pes- 
cadores, Others harassed 
enemy shipping along the 
China Coast in the blockade 
operations which Ma^eArthur 
had instituted many ^onthg 
ago. ' ] 



Close associates of the presi- 
dent were around his desk when 
the announcement was made, in- 
cluded Admiral of Fleet WiL 
liam D. Leahy, personal chief of 
staff; Secretary of State James 
Byrnes; Commodore James Var- 
daman, the president's naval 
aide; Brig. Gen. Harry Vaug- 
han, his military aide; Secretary 
of Navy James V. Forrestal, 
Secretary of Treasury Fred M. 
Vinson, Foreign Economic Ad- 
ministrator Leo T. Crowley, 
Special Assistant David K. 
Niles, Maj. Gen. Philip S. 
Fleming, public works adminis- 
trator; and Private Secretary 
Mathew Connelly. 

One of the late comers to 
the conference was Cordell 
Hull, secretary of State for 12 
years under Franklin B. 
Roosevelt and a prime mover 
in the creation of the United 
Nations organization. 

Hull slipped in unnoticed, 
looking wan but in much better 
health than he was a few 
months ago when he had to 
leave office and retire to a 
naval hospital for a complete 
rest. 

Japan's official reply to the 
Allied surrender terms was de- 
livered to Secretary of State 
Bvrnes at 7:06 a.m. (Manila 
Time) by Swiss Foreign Minis- 
ter Max Grassli in the State De- 
partment office. 

Byrnes left his office and 
walked to the executive offices 
of the White House. 

The long vigil of the press in 
Washington was ^nded when 
President Truman alerted the 
White House shortly before 
6 a.m. for early rfcceipt of the 
Japanese reply. 

Secretary Byrnes told news- 
men "to stand by" and left for 
the Pentagon Building. 

The three-day tension was 
broken when a dispatch from 
Berne said Japanese Minister 
Shunichi Kase, arrived at the 
Parliament Building at 4:05 
a.m. He left a few moments 
later and United States Minis- 
ter Leland Harrison arrived at 
the office within few minutes. 

The official Swiss announce- 
ment said that reply was deli- 
vered to Harrison at 1925 
G.M.T. and was cabled to Wash-, 
ington at 2005 G.M.T,

Truman's announcement at 8 
a.m. (Manila Time) set off a 
tired and weary world in com- 
])lete and uncontrollable celebra- 
tion. 

In an impromptu speech on 
the White House lawn,' following 
his press conference, President 
Truman told a large crowd of 
spectators that this was a great 
day for democracy. 

He said it marked the f'nal 
triumph over Fascism and 
would go down in history as 
one of its most noteworthy days. 

The whole country should now 
unite, the President said, in an 
effort to preserve future peace 
of the world.

'iOKYO — Emperor Hirohito porbonii]' 
Jy read the IrnrHriaJ rfHcn'pt accept- 
ing the PcU6i.rn Declaration in a 
nationwide broadia^t at nwm yester- 
day over Domei, the official Japanese 
news agency. It was the first time 
in Japan's history that an Emperor 
had gpoken to the nation over the 
radio. Hirohito f-pcke as foIIowB : 

"To our good and loyal subjects: 
Aft^r pond, ring deeply the general 
trends of the world and the actual 
conditions obtaining in our Empire 
today, we have decided to effect a 
ftttkmctit of the? present situation by 
resorting to an extraordinary meai;- 
jre. 

"We have ordered our government 
:o communicate to the govcrnmentii of 
the United States*, Great Britain, 
China and the Soviet Union that our 
Empire accepts the provisions of 
thf.ir joint declaration. 

"To strive for the common prosper- 
ity and happinei-^ of all nations, as 
wt-11 CB the fce-curity and well being 
<f our subjectf' is the solemn obliga- 
tion which has been handed down by 
our Imperial ancestors, and which we 
Uiy close to heart. 

"Indeed, we de^ilared war on Ameri- 
ca and Britain out of our sincere de- 
hire to ensure Japan's self-preserva- 
tion and the stabilization of East 
Asia, it being far from our thought 
either to infringe upon the sovereign- 
ty of other nations or to embark upon 
territorial aggrandizement. 

"But now the war has lasted for 
nearly four years. Despite the be-st 
that has been done by everyone — the 
gallant fighting of military and naval 
force-8, the diligence and assiduity of 
cur servants of the state and the de- 
voted service of our 100,000,000 people, 
the war situation has developed not 
necessarily to Japan's advant^ige, 
while the general trends of the world 
have all turned against her interest. 

"The enemy has begun to employ 
a new and most cruel bomb, the pow- 
tr of which to do damage is indeed 
inralculablc-, taking the toll of many 
innocent live-*-. Should we continue 
to fight, it Would not only result in 
an ultimate collap.se and obliteration 
of the Japanese nation, but also it 
would lead to the total extinction of 
human civilization. 

"Such being the case, how are we 
to save the millions of our subjects; 
or to atone ourselves before the hal- 
lowed spirits of our Imperial ances- 
tors ? 

"This is the reason why we have 
ordered the acceptance of the provi- 
sions of the joint declaration of the 
powers. 

"We cannot but express the deep- 
est regret to our Allied nations of 
East Asia, who have consistently co- 
opt rated with the empire towards the 
emancipation of East Asia. 

"The thought of these officers and 
men as well ns others who have fal- 
len in the field- of battle, those who 
ditd at their poi-ts of duty, or those 
who met with death and all their be- 
rt lived familie.-. pains our lieart 
night and day. 

"The welfare of the wounded and 
tht war sufferers, and of those who 
have lost their homes and livelihood, 
are the objects of our profound soli- 
citude. The hardships and sufferings 
to which our nation is to be subjected 
hereafter will be certainly great. 

"We are keenly aware of the inner- 
most feelings of all, ye our subjects. 
However, it is according to the dic- 
tate of tinu and fate that we have 
r. s(»lved to Knvt- the way for a grand 
peace for all the generations to come 
by enduring the unavoidable and suf- 
fering what is unsuffcrable. 

"Having bten able to save and 
maintain the structure of the Im- 
perial state, we are always with ye. 
our good and loyal subjects, relying 
upon your sincerity and integrity. 

"Bewaiv most strictly of any out- 
bursts of eme>tion which may en- 
gender needless complications, or any 
fraternal contention and strife which 
may create confusion, lead ye astray 
and cause ye to lose the confidence 
of the world. 

"Let the entire nation continue as 
one family from generation to gene- 
ration, ever firm in its faith of the 
impcrishablencss of its divine end. 
and mindful of its heavy burden of 
responsibilities, and the long road 
before it. , 

"Unite your total strength to be 
devoted to tho construction for the 
future. Cultivate the ways of rec- 
titude, further neibility of spirit 
and work with resolution so as ye 
may inhnnce the innate glory of the 
Imperial state and ke^p pace with 
the progress of the world."

JUSTICE 

Noth'mg could be more fiHIng, from an American or 
Filipino standpoint^ than General MacArthur's choice of Manila 
as the site of Initial negotiations for Japan's unconditional sur- 
render* 

It is the' fulfillment of [ustice that the capital of the Phil- 
ippines, itsliusJcs of buildings and scars of flame bearing mute 
testimony lo ihe unbridled savagery of the enenrty, should wif 
ncH Wa\\\ the end and the beginning of Japan's full-scale bid 
for v/orld conquest. 

It was against Manila, symbol of the first successfu! ex- 
periment in racial equality between the East and the West, 
that Japan first launched its racial war* It was here tbat Japan 
first sounded its battle cryp "Asia for the Asiatics." Manila 
was ^he crown jewel in Japan's Asiatic empire, the choicest 
prize of alt 

And when Japan was forced to tread tbe road back be- 
fore the armed might of America, rt was in Manila that Japan 
exhibiled her greatest act of sadism, vandalism; reached the 
lowest depths of depravity against helpless civilians, in a war 
already distinguished by terr-^r and brutalii7. 

For Manila, to the end; stood as a living, dynamic denial 
of flII that Japan's militarists and propagandists sought to 
wholesale to Asia's millions. Manila, with its modem buildings, 
schools, and as the seat of government for the Philippines, 
served as the American-made model for advancement of all 
Oriental counl-ries. It stood 33 a guidepost for all thos-e peo- 
ples who sought for themselves the opportunity to earn political 
independence. 

And thio weeic, when Japan's emissaries shall wailc down 
i^anila's still shell-pocked streets and gaze out upon block after 
fclocV. of ciumpled masonry left by their own troops, as con- 
quered rather than conquerors, the last edict of justice shall 
havo been served. 

And, as these Japanese envoys see Filipinos and Americans 
work shoulder to shoulder to rebuild a greater Manila upon 
the ashes of the old, a newer symbol of how the East and the 
West can tiVe together in peace and prosperity, then shaH the 
finahy of Japan's defeat be driven honrve.

The Depaitmaat of Informa- 
tion said ycstcriay it was "pre-

war damage aft "'it has not yet 
boon determined what property, 
if any, will be covered for

An office of the War Dajiuige

in Manila 'Svithin a few 
months," tlie Department an- 
nounced, adding "proof of loss'' 
blanks will be issued at that 
time.

the WDC is opened, claims may 
be forwarded (o Coi. James A. 
Myatt. chief claims, APWES-

Representatives of the War

making a general survey of war

accept individual claims or in- 
terview individual claimants, 
but will survey the field to make 
a general assessment of damage 
to ^erve as a basis for estimat- 
ing the amounts required. 

During the last session of the 
U. S. Congress, Senator Millard 
Tydings sought approval 01 a 
bill appropriating $100,000,000 
for ]\<\vmeut of war dainage m

gorously opposed by Pilipi^^<^^ 



government representatives in 
Washington and by some Sena- 
tors. 

Philippine Resident Commis- 
sioner Carlos Romulo said the 
Tydings proposal was "not 
enough." Filipino government 
sources assessed total war 
damage in the Philippines at 
?;i,500,000,000. 

The U. S. Congress tabled 
further action on the Tydings 
measure pending completion of 
the survey.

Peace Job Aheadljg^y j^^j ^^ Pacific Fight 



LONDON — King George VI 
called upon the British Empire 
last night to '*join in thanking 
Almighty God that the war has 
ended/' but warned ^^hat relief 
from past dangers must not 
blind us to demands of the 
future.'^ 

Addressing his subjects in a 
worldwide broadcast, the King 
said: *We shall have to labor 
hard to restore what has been 
lost and to establish peace on 
unshakeable foundations. We 
have our part to play in restor- 
ing the shattered fabric of civil, 
ization. It is a proud and diffi- 
cult part and if you carry on in 
the years to come as you have 
done so splendidly in the war, 
you and your diildren can look 
forward to the future not with 
fear but with high hopes of 
surer happiness for all. 

"I ask you again at this so- 
lemn hour to remember all who 
have laid down their lives and 
all who have endured the loss 
of those they love.'' 



Gen. George C. Kenney, commander of the Far 
East Air Forces and for three years commander of 
General MacArthur's Allied, Air Forces, said yesterday 
in a statement on the end of the war: 

''After more than three and a half years of the 
worst warfare that man has ever been called upon to 
wage, Japan has surrendered.

OKINAWA — Two Japanese^ 
Kamikaze planes, attacking 12 ' 
hours after Japans official ac- 
ceptance of the Potsdam Declar- 
ation terms, crashed on lohwa 
island, 30 miles north of Okina- 
wa, injuring at least two Ameri- 
can soldiers. These latest Ka- 
mikaze attacks, the first over 
Okinawa in many weeks, oc- 
curred in bright moonlight and 
caused the establishment of a 
two-hour blackout over the 
Ryukyus. 

In a special communique from 
Guam, yesterday, Fleet Admiral 
!N[imitz announced that Japanese 
planes had b^en approaching 
U. S. destroyer units after Em- 
peror Hirohito had told his 
people of the acceptance of

newly-appointed Supreme Com- 
mander, has been requested to 
tell the Japanese that American 
defense measures require the 
Third Fleet to destroy any Jap- 
anese planes approaching U. S. 
Ts^rships. 

A Tokyo Radio broadcast yes- 
terday admitted that there were 
reports of Japanese air attacks 
continuing against Allied targets 
but said Imperial headquarters 
"is trying to do its best to pre- 
vent such incidents." The 
broadcast asked that Allied 
fleets or convoys not to ap- 
proach Japanese home waters

completed^^ 



Jap Press Plays 
Up End of War 

SAN FRANCISCO — - The 
Tokyo Radio report^ yesterday 
that Tokyo newspapers gave 
"great prominence" to the end 
of the war and reported "no 
disorders" in the city after the 
surrender announcement. 

The Tokyo Radio broadcast, 
which U. S. government moni- 
tors recorded here said "Inva- 
riably, the Imperial Rescript 
topped the front pages while 
the cabinet instructions and the 
text of the Potsdam Declaration , 
were published in full." 

Japanese newspapers which 
delayed publication in order to 
print the Emperor's surrender 
rescript "unanimously expressed 
the heartfelt support of deci- 
sion," according to Domei. The 
Tokyo newspaper Asahi wame8 
the Japanese people "against 
any illusions regarding hard- 
ships and privations awaiting 
Japan."

Army Plans to Discharge 
5 Millions in 12 Months 

WASHINGTON— The U. S. Army announced yes- 
terday that it hopes to discharge five million men in the 
next 12 months, but stated that the point score required 
for discharge will remain at 85 for the present. 

Secretary of War Stimson also 
announced that the Army has 
lowered to 38 the age at which 
enlisted men may be discharged. 
The Army estimates that 300,- 
000 men over 38 will be eligible 
for release within 90 days after 
they ask for release. 

Stimson explained that "our 
first responsibility before we 



make additional men eligible 
for release from army wiU be 
to make certain that Japanese 
have accepted surrender terms 
in good faith." There are 
2,250,000 trained Japanese sol- 
diers in the Home Islands alone, 
and an equal number still to be 
disarmed in other Pacific and 
Asiatic territory. 



army, navy, and air forces gave 
their lives for this day. They 
fought well, and at last 
our planes were over Japan 
itself. Today, because of these 
brave men, we need fight no 
longer. The airplane changes, 
tomorrow, from a terrible in- 
strument for destruction to a 
great instrument for peace and 
human advance."

Adm. Thomas C. Kinkaid, 
commander of the famous 
Seventh Fleet, which landed 
General MacArthur's armies 
from New Guinea to the Phil- 
ippine Islands, commenting yes- 
terday on Japar^s surrender, 
said: 

*^The acceptance by Japan of 
the terms of the Potsdam de- 
claration brings to an end a 
hard-fought, costly war in 
which the Allied Nations at- 
tained their objective and which 
will have no doubt in the minds 
of the Japanese people that 
their armed forces were over- 
whelmingly defeated." 

* 1: 

Gen. T\^alter Krueger, com- 
manding general of the 6th 
Army, and ground commander 
for General MacArthur since the 
start of the war, said: 

"The officers and men of the 
6th Army rejoice with me that 
the bitter struggle in the Pacific 
has at last been brought to an 
end by the surrender of Japan. \ 
We are proud that we were 
privileged to have a share in 
achieving the great victory but 
humbly bow in the reverent me-

Details Told on ' ^

SEATTLE— Details of the un- 
pjccessful Japanese bomb-car- 
ding unmanned paper baUoons 
^ch landed in northwestern 
America, were disclosed here 
yesterday with the relaxation 
of censorship. 

The report said that more 
than 200 balloons have been 
recovered with more still being 
(ound. Except for the killing 
of six persons who tampered 
with a bomb, causing two small 
gres and diverting manpower 
{or their investigation, the Jap 
tiloons failed completely as a 
or weapon. Not one ever 
dropped on a city or war plant. 
Although many were sighted off 
the Aleutians, very few ever 
reached shore. 

One of the chief factors which 
cade the balloons unsuccessful 
Tv-as faulty workmanship and 
equipment, which failed to

stated.

of the Philippines 
used a transmitter on the island 
of Panay to establish radio con- 
tact with United States forces 
in Pacific. Arms, ammunition 
and medicaU supplies were sent 
to them by submarine from 
bases in New Guinea. From 
small beginnings the Philippines 
resistance forces grew to number 
hundreds of thousands. 

The most famous patriot 
leader was Tomas Confesor, 
grovemor of Iloilo province 
on the island of Panay at the 
time of Japanese invasion. 
Togrether with his wife and 
children, Confesor had to 
move his mountain head- 
quarters several times a 
month hecanse the Japanese 
had put a price on his head. 
Asked to surrender he wrote 
in February, 1943, "Japan is 
trying: to force us to accept 
her system of grovemmeai 
and vi^ys of life which are 
unacceptable/' and added, 
"Principles of democracy and 
democratic institutions were 
broug^ht to life througrh fire 
and bloodshed. I shall there- 
fore, not surrender, as long: as 
I can stand on my feet.'' 

Although the Japanese tor- 
tured inhabitants of villages and 
countryside in order to deter- 
mine whereabouts of patriots 
they continued their warfare 
successfully until the moment of 
liberation. 

Patriot resistance inside? 
China had a long distinguished 
history which began with 
Japan's illegal annexation of 
-Manchuria in 1932. For more 
than a decade various political 
groups in all parts of China had 
fought separately or together to 
throw off Japanese yoke. 

This warfare made up of all 
facets of ancient and modem 
fiehtinff practices had been un- 
relenting. There were times 
during the past decade when the 
Japanese believed resistance had 
subsided in one province or 
aSer But always there was 
a rude awakening. Japanese 
<rarrisons were ambushed, mu- 
nitions and food were captured 
or sabotaged, railroad lines were 
cut or wire communications were 
made^nusable. As Japanese 
?^rcls captured one region their 
Hnes were forever in danger be- 
cause Chinese guerrillas used 
^u^^Ur knowledge of ^^^^^^^^^ 



an unrelenting fight for inde- 
pendence. In April, 1944, riot- 
ing was reported in several 
sections of Korea. At the same 
time, Kuniaki Koiso, then gov- 
ernor general of Korea and later 
temporary Japanese premier, 
urged the people of Korea that 
"there should be no incidents 
which cause disunity of the 
people's morale." 

In Thailand, underground 
fighters kept the populace in- 
formed as to progress of war, 
spreading Allied radio reports 
in pamphlets and by word of 
mouth. Local Thai officials- 
were known to have sabotaged 
Japanese instructions by will- 
ful misinterpretation.

of triumph. 

"Victory is a responsibility 
which must be born with - equa- 
nimity and determination. The 
last of the Axis aggressors has 
been vanquished, not merely by 
superior arms or fightir^g pow- 
er, but by the irresistible force 
of those principles and ideals 
which have vitalizted and as- 
serted the supremacy of free- 
dom over fascism and totalita- 
rianism. 

"Let there be no weakening 
now that victory lias been 
achieved. Let us obliterate 
every hateful vestige of the re- 
^mes that have caused the 
brutalities and atrocities of this 
terrible war. 

"With the same awesome 
deadliness of the atomic bomb 
must the spirit of aggression 
and conquest be wiped out, and 
this can. be done only if there is 
no compromise with the guilty. 

"And we must not fail to 
number among the guMtiest of 
the guilty, those who in the 
eyes of their own people and the 
vAiiAe wttiid, have always stood 
as a symbol of powBr and auth- 
ority. 

*^hese are Hie men who have 
drawn to themselves the fanatic 
loyalty that lias inflicted on 
humanity a cruel and barbaric 
soldiery. 

"My people lift their eyes to 
the yUmighty today. We in 



the Philipfpines have suffered 
untold agony and irreparable 
loss, but we face the future un-

**We fought side by side with

Dismissal Apparently Is" 
Requested by Hirohito 

BULLETIN 

TOKYO — Emperor Hirohito at 9:30 a.m. yester- 
day commanded Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni to^ 
form a new Japanese cabinet, Domei news agency 
said last night. ^ 

★ ★ ★ 

SAN FRANCISCO— The Japanese cabinet headed 
by Admiral Baron Kantaro Suzuki resigned en masse 
a few hours after Emperor Hirohito told the Japanese 
people' he had accepted the surrender terms of the 
Potsdam declaration. The resignation apparently was 

requested by the Emperor. ^ 

Suzuki's last official act wasf 
to admonish the Japanese to | Qsmena FoCUSeS ... 
obey the Emperor. The cabmet 
al?o issued a proclamation cal- 
ling on the people to obey the 
terms of the Imperial Rescript 
announcing the surrender. 

Suzuki, 77 years old, escaped 
death nine years ago when 
army hot-heads attempted to 
assassinate him on grounds he 
was anti-militarist. He headed 
a cabinet devoid of militaiy 
figures except War Minister 
Korechika Anami, who took his 
own life early Wednesday. 
Before groingr to the Impe- 
rii) Palace, Suzuki and mem- 
bers of his cabinet held a 
full-dress extraordinary ses- 
sion at Suzuki's home. A 
Domei News dispatch report- 
ing:- the meeting said "the 
Pr^feier spoke and expressed 
his desire to comply with His 
Majesty's wishes," thus in- 
dicating the Emperor had de- 
manded the cabinet's resigna- 
tion. 

Prior to his resignation, Su- 
zuki in a broadcast over Tokyo 
radio attributed Japan's de- 
feat to *'the enemy's use of a 
new 'type of bomb." The Pre- 
mier told the people "defense 
of the national polity is our 
duty now." 

^uzuki said the Emperor de- 
cided to accept the Allied sur- 
render terms at a historical 
conference attended by all ca- 
binet members and four Jap- 
anese elder statesmen. 

Suzluki said the Emperor 

*'gruci(}usly listened" to the 

views and opinions of each of 

those present and then de- 
clared *'in view of the world 

situation and our situation* 

! do not w isli further to turn 

our country into scorched 

earth even though my life 

may be lost." 

The Premier said the Jap- 
anese "really regret" Russia's 
entry into the war — that and 
the atomic bomb. 

"The people of Japan simply 
and deeply express their 
apology to the Emperor," Suzu- 
ki declared. **In spite of the 
people's failuiSe, he did not scorn 
the people. On the contrai-y 
he declared he wished to save 
the people even by losing his 
own life. All present could not 
help but cry" despite the fact 
they were still in ^tlie presence 
of the Emperor." - 

Su/.uki pointed out to the^Tap- 
anese people Hiat under the 
tGrr\i.s of ^the Potsdam declara-r 
lioii, Japan agreed to uncondi- 
lional surrender.

Tokyo Says . • • 

(Continued from Front Page) 

Japanese government had re- 
ceived Secretary of State 
Byrnes' note on behalf of all 
Allied powers accepting Jap- 
anese surrender. 

In an English broadcast 
beamed to the United States, 
Japan's Domei News agency 
said ^'text of the United States 
government's note regarding 
cessation of hostilities only 
came into the hands of the 
Japanese government at 11 a.m.

sary arrangements are accord-

guage be set up in Tokyo. The

render. 

There was no acknowledg- 
ment for several hours and 
transmitting facilities in the 
United^States and Signal Corps 
in.M^ila joined in bombard- 
ing Japan with messages from 
MacArthur. 

At 9 p.m. Wednesday, Manila 
time, Japanese stations ac-

was acknowledged. However,, 
actual answer to the message 
had not been received, accord- 
ing to press services.

to accept surrender of ene- 
my troops, Lt. Gen. Albert 
C. Wedemeyer, commander

All units under Field Mar-

Wedemeyer stated. 

The American commander 
said fighting still continues in 
isolated areas, one of which is 
northeast of Kweilin 

Wedemeyer added there was a 
strong possibility an American

China after the war. Its duties 
would be to assist in disarm

Churchill Says Bomb 
Saved U Million Lives 

LONDON — Use of the atomic bomb against Japan 
enabled the Allies to call off a gijrantic offensive that 
might have cost 1,250,000 Allied lives, Winston Chur- 
chill told the House of Commons Thursday. 



Isolated Japs 
Told War Over 

U. S. Army commanders in- 
creased their efforts yesterday, 
to notify Japanese forces isolat- 
ed in the Philippines, of Jap- 
an's surrender. 

Leaflets, loudspeakers, signs 
and volunteer prisoners-of- 
war were used to inform Jap- 
anese commanders and troops 
of their Emperor's capitulation. 

Scattered fighting continued 
in the mountains of Northern 
Luzon. Principal clashes cen- 
tered around pre-dawn Jap- 
anese banzai attacks. 

Newly captured Japanese 
prisoners at first refused to be- 
lieve news of their Emperor's 
surrender. They said they had 
had no war news in two months. 

However, one Japanese pris- 
oner said he believed there 
would be no trouble when Jap- 
anese troops learned the sur- 
render was the wish of the 
Emperor. The Japanese people, 
the army and the navj' exist, 
he said, only at the will of the 
Mikado. 



planned at Potsdam and that he 
and President Truman had al- 
ready given the order to prepare 
for it. However, atomic bombing 
and Ja nan's surrender had made 
this offensive unnecessary, he 
declared. 

Speaking of the atomic bomb, 
Churchill said, "President Tru- 
man and myself at Potsdam ap- 
proved the military plans to un- 
chain the dread forces." 

Answering critics of the new 
weapon, Churchill declared: 

"There are voices which as- 
sert that the atomic bomb should 
never have been used at all. I 
cannot associate my.self with 
such ideas. Six years of total 
war have convinced most people 
that had Japanese or Germans 
discovered this new weapon, 
they would have used it upon us 
to our complete destruction with 
utmost alacrity." 

Churchill expressed surprise 
that people "should adopt a po- 
sition that rather than throw 
this bomb we should have sacri- 
ficed a million American lives 
and a quarter million British 
lives in the desperate battles 
and massacres of an invasion 
of Japan." 

Churchill said Premier Stalin 
had been informed at Potsdam 
that "we contemplated using an

Peace 

Lay Down Arms 
By Monday 

MOSCOW— The Com- 
mander of Russia's Far 
Eastern Armies, Marshal 
Alexander Vasilevsky last 
night ordered the Jap- 
anese Kwantnng Army to 
cease operations and to 
surrender by noon, Aug- 
ust 20th, the Moscow 
Radio reported yesterday. 

Marshal Vasilevsky acknowl- 
edged the receipt of request 
from the Japanese Kwantung 
Army Headquarters to cease 
operations but charged that Jap- 
anese forces had counter-at- 
tacked Soviet forces at the same 
time that the request was being 
broadcast. 

Vasilevsky was quoted as 
saying, "A^ . soon as Japanese 
troops begin to lay down their 
arms, Soviet troops •^'wjill. cease 
operations." 

Previous iSoviet communique 
had reported Japanese counter- 
attacks in Manchuria and Korea 
despite the Japanese Govern- 
ment's surrender to the Alli^^. 
The communique disclosed that- 
Russian forces were making 
only slight progress in Man- 
churia and were at a standstill 
in .some areas: The Soviet First 
and Second Far Eastern Armies 
reported the capture of towns 
in northern ai'id northeastern 
Manchuria, while the Soviet 
Transbaikal Army nnnounced 
the capture of Taoan, 200 miles 
west of Harbin. 

In Korea, the Russians rep- 
orted Jap counter-attacks in an 
unsuccessful attempt to retake 
Sheshin whose occupation by 
the Russianjs was announced on 
Tuesday. 



Tokyo Newspaper Warns «?aps 
To ^Play-Bair WUh Allies— Or Else! 



SAN FRANCISCO-— Accord- 
ing to a Tokyo Radio broadcast 
heard here, the Tokyo news- 
paper "Mainichi Shimbun," in 
special column published 
yesterday, declared that "If 
Japan should go back on its 
word by taking an evasive at- 
titude in living up to the forth- 
coming peace terms dictated by 
the Allied Powers, there would 
be no possibility whatsoever for 
Japan to rise to her feet once 
again." It added that "it was 
characteristic of Japanese 



people to strictly observe moral 
principles." 

The newspaper warned the 
Japanese people not to take the 
attitude that Japan would not 
have been defeated if events 
during: the final days of the war 
had been different. 

In a flat contradiction of pre- 
vious Japanese statements, the 
article frankly stated, "We 
<qhould remember that the new

FACING THE FUTURE 

President Osmefiii, In his ial-est message to Congress, 
strikes a realistic note amidst jubilation over Japan's defeat, 
soberly directing his people's attention to the vast job which 

lies ahead. ■ 

The president reminds Filipinos, that while the United 
States plans tc take specific action to rehabilitate this war- 
broken nation, "this generous attitude does not relieve us of 
tho ciur/ wi iieiping oufselves. 

The task of refitting the Philippines for the great role 
she is destined ro play In the rehabilitation of all Asia, is fully 
as important as the role she was intended to play in the defeat 

Already, much has been done- The Army and the Navy 
have taken vast strides in sweeping Manila's fine harbor clean 
of sunken and floating derelicts. Piers have been repaired, 
and new ones added. Rail lines and roads have been ?^tended. 
widened, and r-newed to step up the city's capacity ro handle 
cargoes. Some industries, principally afaaca and h^ianlla hemp, 
have been restored. A good start has been made. 

Underscoring the urgency of the moment for all Filipinos 
to join In the task of re'ouildlng their country, and laying broad 
plans for the fut'jrs, is the fact that the United i^ates has 
added still another commitment in the occupation of Japan. 

For with occupation comes more mouths to feed, until 
Japan's food sources can be restored, and her industries re- 
turned to some semblance of normality. Japan's rational 
staple, like the Philippines, Is rice. And that means available 
world supplies of this commodity must be spread st.ll more 

The prirnary problem immediately facing the Philippines, 
how that hostilities have ceased, is supplementing food sup- 
•plles which must b- brought from abroad, by an intensive local 
•production program. This is a responsibility in wh.ch every 
Filipino must share, by utilizing every Inch of unused soil for 
l^oina 9r,own produce.

which fired shells aimed by

in 27 minutes had sunk three 
cruisers and three destroyers. 
In November, 1942, the U. S. S.

DurinpT tht; Battle of Britain, 
radar shore operators would 
spot G'ermaii i>]anes moving^ in 
towards En,c:land and would 
then contact the nearest British 
fif^hter pilot. By watching? the 
progress of the German on one 
screen and the route of his own

literally fly the British plane 
into position where the piiot's

would gi^ide him to the enemy.

-Truman 

WASHINGTON — President 1 tlie Korean :-fir.:f/Jon and it v;c^,^ 
Truman told a press conference hii: belief that the Cairo declrir^t- 
Thursday Japan would be oc- . tion which liltimately would 
cujDied SD long as it was ncces- niake Korea a free and indepen- 



sary and that the length of 
occupation would entirely de- 
pend on how the Japanese 
demonstrated they can be 
trusted as a peaceable people. 
V-J Day will not come until 
the Japanese surrender is ac- 
tually signed^ the President 
said. 

Occupation of both Germany 
and Japan, the President de- 
clared will be necessary until 
such time as Germans and Jap- 
anese are rehabilitated in the 
democratic way of life. 

President Truman indicated 
Japan will not be divided into 
occupation zones as was Ger- 
many. He said the situation in 
Japan is different from that in 
Europe and he saw no necessi- 
ty for zones in Japan, Truman 
added occupation forces in Jap- 
an would be drawn from all 
major Allies but these troops 
will be all under the supreme 
command of General Mac- 
Arthur. 

The President said Japan will 
have no chance to obtain re- 
\'enge for defeat in %var. This 
was in answer to a reporter 
who said most Japanese radio 
pronouncements since Hirohito's 
acceptance of the surrender 
terms seemed to indicate Jap- 
anese are planning military 
action in the future. 

Discussing foreign affairs 
generally, Truman said there 
had been talk at Potsdam of 



dent stale woukl be carried out 
Congress will decide when io 
end wartime draft, the Presi- 
dent said, adding he will make 
a recommendation to Congress 
on imiveisal peacetime military 
training. 

The President said he hoped 
Conr ^ess would cooperate in 
pe>^ceiime development of the 
atom splitting project. The 
work is continuing until Con- 
gress makes a decision, lie 
added. Previously, Truman 
had urged Congress to establish 
a commission which would con- 
trol production of atomic ener- 
gy and direct its development 
for peacetime uses.

Among those said to be taking

joined with elements described 
as "Nationalists" in fighting

Truman Proclaims ^ Peace Day^ 

WASHINSTON— President Truman has set aside Sun- 
day, August 19, as a day of prayer to God io "support and 
lead us into paths of peace." 

The President also called upon his countrymen '*to de- 
dicate this day of prayer to the memory of those who have 
given fhefr lives to make possible our victory," 

In his proclamation, Truman pointed out victory "has come 
from the massive strength of arms and materials created by 
peace-loving peoples who knew that unless they won decency 
in the world would end. "It has come from millions of peace- 
ful citizens a!l over the world— turned soldiers almost over- 
night—who showed the ruthless enemy that they were not 
afraid to fight and to die and that they Ic new how to wtn^ 

"If has come with the Tielp of God who w^s with us in the 
early days of adversity and of disaster and who has now brought 
Us to this glorious day of triumph. 

"Let us give thanks to Him and remember that we have 
now dedicated ourselves to follow in His ways to lasting and 
just peace, and to a better world* 

*'ThIs day Is a new beginning in the history of freedom 
on this earth."

land. It was also announced 
that three squadrons of Light- 
ning fighters will guide the 
Japanese plane to the designat- 
ed airstrip. 

Following Japan*s note an- 
nouncing surrender to the 
AUies, General MacArthut sent 
two messages to the Japanese- 
one directing that radio facili- 
ties be arranged for transmit- 
ting messages in English be- 
tween Tokyo and Manila, and 
the other ordering the Japanese 
Emperor to issue a *'cease fire" 
command to all Japanese units, 
and to send emidsarief^ to 
Manila for preliminary confer- 
ences. 

An earlier Japanese broadcast 
on Thursday said the Japanese 
Government would proceed at 
once with the necessary prepa 
rations and would notify Gen- 
eral MacArthur as to the date 
of the flight of the surrender 
representatives "which will take 
place as soon as possible/* 

The Japanese broadcast also 
reported that Emperor Hirohito 
has issued his officiol "cease 
fire" order to the Japanese 
forces at 1:00 a.m. Thursday 
(Manila Time), and was pre- 
paring to send members of the 
Imperial Family to all the 
Pacific and Asiatic fighting 
fronts to see that the order was 
enforced. 

The Japanese broadcast yes- 
terday also said that the Em- 
peror*s order should be received 
by Japanese forces in Japan 
within 48 hours: by forces in 
China. Manchuria, Korea and 
the southern regions within six 
days; Bou^^ainville in ei^^ht days

ippines in 12 days.

wer a^^:ainst Japan." He as- 
serted *^it is to this atom bomb 
more than any other factor thatj 
we may ascribe the sudden and 
speedy endinj^ of the war 
against Japan,'* He sa'a tke 
secret of the new weapon i 
"should not at pi'csent be im- 
parted to other nations in the 
interests of the common safety i 
of the world." 

The former British PremSfr 
revealed that Ru.ssia's C'-cision 
to join the war against "apiJn 
was made lon^ before ti;'- f a T 
of Germany. He said Stalin 
had promised him that Eus.^?a 
would declare war on Japan 
"three months after the capitu- 
lation of Germany." 

"The fact that the G-fman 
Army surrendered on Mar B aniT 
the Kussmns declared ' -ar rn 
August 8 is no ni^n-e coir/:idence ' 
but anoth*?r example c-^ thp 
fidelity and punctuality with 
which Marshal Stalin and his 
valiant armies always kept their 
military engagements." 

Churchill said United SUtes 
and British joint chiefs of staff 
simultaneously submitted ^ 
master plan for a knockout of- 
fensive ajrainst Japan in Ma- 
laya, Netherlands East Indies- 
and Japan itself- He declared 
the undertakings would have been 
the {greatest military operation 
in history. 

Replying to Churchilh Prime 
Minister Att.!ee described him 
as *'one of the main architect? 
of our victory," adding ^'his 
place in history is secure. Vic- 
tory was really the outcome of 
plans made under his leader-

Russians Tell Japs

SAN FBANCISCO— Marshal Alexander M. Vasi- 
lev^ky, Russian commander in Manchuria, ha^ ordered 
Soviet forces ''to cease military operations all sectorsr 
of the front after all operations have stopped on youi^ 
side," according to a message broadcast to the Japan(?a€

on Saturday, * t • . 

]'cctly to Marshal VaaileVfeky's 
headquarters. llie' Japanese

Earlier^ the Japanese govem- 
ment had sent an urgent mes- 
sage to General MacArthur a& 
Supreme Allied Commander 
requesting that he take steps 
to halt "the Soviet offensive" 
in Manchuria, 



Vasilevaky's message came on 
the heels of Russian disclosure 
that Soviet amphibious forces 
were storming ashore at new 
key points on the Korean coa$t. 

The message told General 
Otozo Yamada, the Japanese 
commander, thai Soviet planes 
landed a Russian delegation at 
Ha] bin (Changchun), capital of 
Manchuria, at 7:30 p,m. Satur- 
day, Manila time, to pick up 
the Japanese Kwantung Army 
surrender delegate. 

The message said the Soviet

^ _ _ UNPRECEDENTED 

Nearly a week has slipped past since Japan announced that 
she had accepted the Allied formula for unconditional sur- 
render and by now. the world has had a chance to assess the 
dramatic events of the past few days, which burst upon an un- 
suspecting world with as nnuch explosive surprise as an atomic 

'^^^^ Unprecedenl-ed best describes today's situation. For the 
first time in history an island empire has fallen without invasion. 
For the first time In history, air power, through the awesome In- 
froduction of l-he atomic bomb, has been able to force a major 

decision in warfare. , o -r. 

Actually, the victory achieved in the Pacific was a victory 
over mind, rather than a victory over body and machines. Some- 
Ihing revoluHorai7 was accomplished, which die-hards said 
couldn't be done— break the Japanese mental will to resist. 

Actually, it was not the atomic bomb that broke Japan's 
spirit but the mental picture of what it would do, should the 
■bombings persist. Actually, It was not the lightning advance 
of the Russians In Manchuria that compelled the Japanese lo 
throw in the towel but the utter Hopelessness of a continued 
war which Russia's entry connoted. It was th-. foreshadowing 
of stee!, aqd fire, and guns to -vhlch Japan's homeland would 
have been subjected under the Invading armies of General Mac- 
Arthur, rather than Invaslo^r Itself which precipitated Japan's 
decision. 

fn the "thought warfare" waged against Japan in the past 
months, possibly even more effective than the threat of Inva- 
sion. the atomic bomb, the naval assaults, and Russia's entry, 
was the P9tsdam. Declaration, wnlch offered the enemy an 
honorable way out. ^ 

It will remain for historians of the future to weigh and 
gauge the ultimate effects of ail these contributory factors which

Japanese Envoys . . . 

(Continued from Front Page) 

As they were driven to their 
spare quarters on Dewey Boule- 
vard, they could also see a 
forest of masts and smokestacks 
from the hundreds of Liberty 
ships, transports, landing ships, 
and tankers which cluttered 
Manila harbor. 

♦ * * 

The arrival of the Jap- 
anese envoys in Manila was 
considerably hastened by Gen- 
eral MacArthur*s message to 
Japanese Imperial Headquar- 
ters last Thursday by radioing 
a blunt message that no further 
delays in arranging for preli- 
minary surrender negotiations 
would be tolerated by him. Gen. 
MacArthur's message said in 
part: 

**The directive from this 
headquarters is clear and ex 
plicit and is to be complied with 
without further delay/- 



OKINAWA — Japan's peace 
emissaries arrived by air at le 
Shima island just west of Oki- 
nawa early yesterday afternoon, 
and after transferring to an 
American C-54 transport plane, 
took off 45 minutes later for 
Manila to confer with General 
MacArthur and receive ''certain 
requirements'' for the surrender 
of their empire. 

Lieut. Gen. Ennis C. White- 
head, commanding U. S. Army 
Fifth Air Force and Brig. Gen.

Japanese delegates. 



terms in good faith. 

Warning that General Mac- 
Arthur must have a force pow- 
erful enough to insure peace 
and quell uprisings, Stimson 
said '*we must have the means 
to stamp out inexorably and 
completely any enemy upris- 
ings.'' 

The .speed with v.'hich an es- 
timated 7,000,000 veterans are 
returned to civilian life depends 
on proof that "no new treachery 
is being planned by any groups 
in the Japanese population," 
the War Secretary stated. 

**I do not believe that there 
has ever been a case in history 
where so large an army has 
been so rapidly taken from 
civilian life, trained, equipped, 
transported to fronts and put 
into battle, as the Army of the 
United States in this war," 
Stimson declared. 

''Except for those units which 
are specifically requested for 
future shipments by the Com- 
mander-in-Chief of Army 
Forces in the Pacific, General 
MacArthur, and the command- 
ing general of United States 
forces in the China theater of 
operations, General Wedemeyer, 
and except for the flow of low- 
point replr.cements, the gigan- 
tic process of re-deployment 
which started with Germany's 
surrender will be thrown in re- 
verse. 

"The first job is to make vic- 
tory secure by suitable deploy- 
ment of our Pacific occupation 
forces and demilitarizing Jap- 
an. 

"Plans for shutting off the tre- 
mendous flow of weapons and 
equipment that has poured from 
factories of America to the war 
fronts of the world are ready 
and have already been put into 
effect. 

"All of us are conscious in 
this moment of victory of the 
tremendous debt we owe to the 
fighting men, but at the same 
time we must have in mind the 
grim responsibility to make 
permanent the peace for which 
so many Americans have given 
their lives," Stimson said. 




Canton Occupied By 
Ch'hiese Soldiers 

CHUNGKING— Chinese First 
Army troops were reported to 
have already entered Canton 
and were scheduled to receive 
the surrender of Japanese 
forces in South China yesterday. 

Liberation of Canton will free 
a city famed as the cradle of 
>he Chinese revolution. It has 
been in the hands of Japanese 
invaders since October, 1938. 

Chinese First Army troops 
are American - trained and 
American-equipped. Veterans 
of the Burma c;impaign, they 
^*»ad been flown into China after 
the Burma campaign and v;ere 
set for a major counter-offen- 
sive against the invaders v;hen 
war ended.

Jap Originator of ^Kamikaze^ 
Plane Attacks Kills Himself 

SAN FRANCISCO— Vice Admiral Takijiro Onishi, 
assistant chief of the Japanese Navy general staff, com- 
mitted suicide Thursday at his official residence, ac- 
cording to a Japanese navy ministry announcement. 
Onishi was the man who was*^^ " 



revealed by Japanese radio in 
May as the originator of suicide 
plane attacks. 

He served as commander-in- 
chief of Japanese naval air 
forces in the Philippines from 
November, 1944 to May, 1945. 
He was made vice chief of the 
naval general staff on May 29, 
1945, during the.shakeup of the 
navy high command. 

Two days later, Kusuo Oya, 
editorial chief of Domei News 
Agency, announced in a domes- 
tic broadcast that a new com- 
mand headed by Vice Admiral 
Jisaburo Ozaw^a, as command- 
er-in-chief of the combined 
fleet, and Admiral Soemu Toyo- 
da, as chief of the general staff, 
would devote its efforts to pre- 
paring all branches of the navy 
for "special attack tactics." 

Onishi W'as chosen vice chief, 
Oya told the Japanese people, 
"because he was the originator 
as well as one of the persons 
who perfected air special at- 
tack tactics."

GUAiM — A large group of 
Japanese prisoners had been 
released and given a safe con- 
duct pass to go into Guam's 
jungles in an attempt to round 
up about 200 of their country- 
men, Maj, Gen. Larsen, island 
comn^ander, reported yesterday. 

The **free" Japanese are un- 
der the leadership of a Japanese 
field officer who volunteered 
to order all troops still at large 
to surrender in the name of the 
Emperor. 

Gen. Larsen said the Japanese 
officer had been furnished with 
intelligence maps of Guam and 
other information as to known 
positions of Jap stragglers.

KWANTUNG ARMY 
QUITS, REDS SAY 

MOSCOW — Japan's famed Kwantung army has 
ceased resistance in most sections of Manchuria and is 
surrendering en masse, the Soviet High Command an- 
nounced Sunday night. 

More than 98,000 Japanese troops out of an esti- 
mated 1,000,000 men in the Kwantung army surren- 
dered to Soviet troops on three Manchurian fronts Sun-

MacArthur Will Land In 
Japan Within Ten Bays 

BULLETIN 

General MacArthur's Headquarters announced 
last night that in his capacity as Supreme Allied 
Commander, Gen. MacArthur will **soon proceed to 
Japan with accompanying forces," ai:id that subject 
to weather that will permit landings^ he anticipated 
"that the Instrument of Surrender will be signed with- 
in ten days.'' 



The statement by General 
MacArthur, which followed the 
departure of the Japanese emis- 
saries, reads as follows: 

"The Japanese emissaries have 
reported to General Headquar- 
ters. They imparted all infor- 
mation required, and the in- 
structions of the United Nations 
are being conveyed by them to 
the Government of Japan and 
to the Japanese Imperial Gen- 
eral Headquarters. In my ca- 
pacity as Supreme Commander 
for the Allied Powers, I shall 
soon proceed to Japan with 
accompanying forces composed 
of ground, naval and air ele- 
ments. Subject to weather that 



will permit landings, it is anti- 
cipated that the Instrument of 
Surrender will be signed within 
ten days. 

'At that time, having accept- 
ed the general surrender of Jap- 
anese armed forces for the 
United Str.tes, Chinese Republic, 
United Kingdom and Union of 
Soviet Socialist Republics, and 
in the interests of the other 
United Nations at war with Jap-

A reasonable allowance could be made tor this, now- 
ever. It was natural for the Emperor to try to save face by 
saying In effect that Japan could not hold out against the 
world. But his assertion ^hat the Imperial State had been pre- 
served and his pleas tha^ the Japanese people remain mindful 
of' their country's divine rrtission makes us wonder whether Hlro- 
hito really understands v.hat has happened to him and his 
country. ' 

But IF {-he Japanese do not yet know, General MacArthur 
is just the Instructor who can teach them. Any number of 
good men could have been named for the post of Supreme 
Commander, but there were special reasons for selecting Mac- 
Arthur. 

MacArthur Is not only a great strategist with a long and 
fine record of achievement but he knows his East and he knows 
a lot aboul- Orientals. 

His early orders to the Japanese show that he means to 
stand for no foolishness. Instead of going to them to lay down 
the requirements of surrender he makes the Japanese come to 
film. He directs Tokyo to communicate with his headquarters 
in-^Manita, by" radio set aside for that purpose in the English 
language only. 

Americans can rest satisfied that their interests are «n

M^mla Avfmy and Navy Club To 
Be Rebuilt and Reorganized 

Tlie.Amiy and Navy Club of IManila, formed more 
than 40 years ago but inactive by necessity during the 
three year.s of Jap occupation is now being reorganized, 
it was announced yesterday. ^ 

Plans are being made to rebuild the clubs once- 
handsome home on Manila Bay, now roofless and badly 
batter^ed.as result of bitter ^f ighting around it last Feb- 
ruary. . _ ^ 

The club continued to func- 
tion after war broke out Dec. 
7, 1941, under blackout condi- 
tions, but was closed ou New 
Year's eve, 194*4- The Japanese 
then took it 6vei\ 

Maj. Gen. William F, Mar- 
quat, anti-aircraft ofiicer of 
Army Forces in the Pacific, has 
been elected president of the 
re-activated club. Other of- 
ficers are: Capt. M. L. Hersey, 
U.S.N., iirst vice president: 
IMaj. Gen. C. L. Sturdevant. 
second vice president; Col. Har- 
ry Adamson. secretary-^issistant 
treasurer; and E. B. Ford, civil- 
ian member, treasurer-assistant 
secretary. 

While' the club was in its 
inactive state, a meeting of the 
Board of Directors was held in 
Australia on June 4, 1942. Col. 
C. M. Savage, secretary-treas- 
urer, was given authority to 
withdraw the club's funds and 
l-HU'chase war bonds with the 
money, depositing the bonds to 
the credit of the club. 

The club, a private corpora- 
tion, has $32,600 on deposit in 
three banks in the United 
States and has, in addition. 
$20,000 which was donated by 
the NounuvvOflicors Club, al'ter 
the • South Pacitic Area went 
out of existence. 



Japs Return To 
Scene Of Crime 

The Jap surrender envoys 
came, they saw — and the once 
conquerors everyv/here were 
by humiliating tokens of 
their own defeat accentuated by 
the impressive trade mark of 
American superiority and effi- 
ciency. 

The silver C-54 -surrender 
ship ah'ghted on re-built Nichols 
Field, which the arrogant Jap:, 
used as a work spot for Ameri- 
can prisoners. It will long be re- 
membered by American cap- 
tives as the worst Jap hell-hole 
on Luzon. 

Every day the Japs brought 
them in trucks from their pris- 
on quarters in Pasay. They 
helped the Japs make it into 
an airfield — at the point of 
bayonets and gun muzzles. 
They were cruelly flogged by 



Il®M<ffi As Key U.S. 
Pacific Base Urged 

WASHINGTON — U. S. control over certain is- 
land bases formerly in the hands of Japanese and over 
American-built bases in island territories of Allied 
nations, is recommended in the report of the House 
Naval Affairs Sub-Committee, released yesterday by 
Chairman Carl Vinson. 



Specifically, the committee 
.sa'.i that the United States 
sh'^uld have at least dominat- 
ing control over the former 
m.andated islands of the Mar- 
shaiis, Carolines and IJarianas, 
and the Japanese islands of 
Izus, Bonins and Ryukyus. 

The U. S. should also be giv- 
en specific rights to sites where 
American bases have been con- 
structed on islands of other 
Allied nations, the report said. 

With respect to Manus, Nou- 
mea, Espiritu Santo, Guadalca-

these bases are links m our 
chain of security, and no chain 
is stronger than its weakest 
link, we cannot permit any 
liriks to be in the hands of 
those who cannot defend it." 

The U. S. must not permit 
its Pacific bases to lapse back 



Norwegian Traitor 
Sentenced To Death 

OSLO— Reidar Haaland, the 
first Norwegian war criminal to 
be sentenced to death by the 
Norwegian Supreme Court, was 
executed here yesterday. Ha- 
aland was charged with serving 
in the Gestapo and with tortur- 
ing Norwegian political pris- 
oners. 



Financial Aid Given 
To Cities, Provinces 

The Commonwealth Insular 
government has extended a total 
aid of over P3, 800,000 to all 
provincial, city and municipal 
governments which liave been 
fmancially handicapped as a 
result of the war, it was an- 
nounced yesterday. 

This aid, equivalent to 50 
percent of the average quarter- 
ly expenses of these govern- 
ment units, will be spent dur- 
ing the period from July to 
September. 

Records of the Department 
of Finance show that the aid to 
provincial governments alone 
totaled Pl,453,301. City gov- 
ernments received a total of 
PI, 185,421 and municipal gov- 
ernments, PI, 183,986. 

The city of Manila received 
the largest share of the nation- 
al aid which amounted to 
P813,389.80. Baguio's share 
amounted to P77,477 and that 
of the city of Cebu was 
P90,850.69. 

Among the provinces, Cebu 
received PI 14,378; Pangasinan 
P113,941; Iloilo, P104.874; and 
Leyte, P103.092. 



into a state of unpreparednes.^ 
as in instances of Guam an^ 
Wake, prior to the present war. 
the report pointed out. 

U. S. strategy of defense in 
Pacific should revolve around 
center line running north of thf- 
Equator through the Hawaiian 
Islands, the Marshalls, Caro- 
lines, Marianas and the Phil- 
ippines, the report furthej- 
stated. The northern flank 
should be composed of defen- 
sive fortifications in the Aleu- 
tians and the Kuriles. Thf 
southern flank should be com- 
posed of defensive fortification.^ 
in the Admiralties, New He- 
brides, New Caledonia an^ 
Sam.oa. 

Of all the bases studied by 
the sub-committee, those tha* 
appeared to possess the greates* 
advantage as main fleet base> 
were: Pearl Harbor, Guam anrj 
Saipan; Iloilo, Philippines. 
Manus, Admiralty Islands; ana 
Noumea, New Caledonia. 

Secondary bases, the report, 
said, should be maintained at 
Midway, Okinawa, Ryukyus, 
Subic Bay and Palau.

Gen. Casey Says Engineer Units 
Not Used on Civilian Projects 



"Engineer troops will not be 
used, here or elsewhere, to re- 
store civilian enterprise,'' Maj. 
General Hugh J. Casey, Chief 
Engineer, GHQ, AFPAC, said 
yesterday, in explaining the 
didVronce that exists between 
the miUtary engineering effort 
and civilian rehabilitation and 
their efYoct on the possible re- 
tention of Engineer troops in 
(ho Pacilic. 

Gen. Casey said that rebuild- 
ing and rehabilitation are civil- 
ian pn^blems which agencies 
sucli as UNKHA and F.EA are 



preparing to assist, and that the 
Army Engineers are concerned 
solely with such engineering 
projects as are an integral part 
of the military effort. 

"The Engineer troops that 
are in this theater were taken 
from their homes to defeat an 
enemy that threatened the 
United States," Gen. Casey 
stated. ''The enemy is no 
longer a direct military threat, 
but certain installations must 
be completed, and facilities 
provided for the support of the 
Army of Occupation through- 
out Japan.'* 



Philippine Army Order 

Is Revoked And Superseded 

By direction of the President of the Philippines and 
with the approval of the Commander-in-Chief of the 
U. S. Army Forces in the Pacific, the controversial 
General Orders No. 20 has been revoked and superseded 
by General Orders No. 135, it was announced yesterday 
by the office of Nat^ional Defense Secretary Alfredo 
Montelibano. 



General Orders No. 20 laid 
down a policy on service by 
officers and enlisted men of the 
Philippine Army and the Phil- 
ippine Constabulary during the 
Japanese occupation. 

Those affected under the new 
orders are those officers and 
men who accepted appoint- 
ment or performed service in 
any capacity in any activity 
controlled by the Japanese or 
by a Japanese-sponsored pup- 
pet government," with specific 
provisions for those who (1) 
''engaged in the buying and 
selling of war materials;'^ (2) 
"gave aid, comfort and suste- 
nance to Japanese soldiers;'' 
(3) ' 'prostituted our women to 
the Japanese;" (4) "revealed 
military information to the 
enemy;" (5) "engaged in es- 
pionage work for the enemy;" 
(6) "worked with the Japanese 
propaganda corps;" and (7) 
"committed other act or acts

Shortage of Teachers 
In Provinces Critical 



A shortage of teachers in pub- 
lic schools^ particularly in the 
provinces, threatens to impede 
the government's educational 
program^ already handicapped 
by a three-year setback during 
Jap occupation, according to re- 
ports received at Malacanan. 

Undersecretary of Public 
Instruction Florentino Cayco 
yesterday warned "the resigna- 
tion of able and experienced 
public school teachers may 
cause a disintegration of our 
schools, In the end^ we may 
have schools in name only." 

Reports from division supe- 
rintendentSp provincial govern- 
ors and school supervisors re- 
vealed low ssilaries and the 
current monetary inflation have 
resulted in numerous resigna- 
tions. Almost all public school 
teachers who have quit are now 
said to be engaged in business. 

According to the Department 
of Instruction^ teachers who 
are graduates of the Philippine 
Normal School get P55 a months 
while an ordinary high school 
graduate receives P40 teaching 
in the intermediate schools. 
High school teachers receive a 
Uttle more, 

Manuel Escarilla, until re- 
cently division superintendent 
of schools for Cavite province^ 
said an ordinary school teach- 
er's salary for one month was 
not enough to pay for the tea ch- 
erts board and lodging. 

In Nueva Ecija, Pangasinan, 
Batangas, Ilocos Sur, Samar, 
Lcyte — the story is the same^ 
Gregorio Lardixabal, division 
superintendent for EatanF?os, 
said he had to engage under- 
^^raduatcs as teachers because 
high school graduates would not 
accept low salaries. 

In many towns in T^cytc and 
Samar, those qualified to leach 
orcfci' to work nn U. S. Army 
projects. Six to O. Abudc, a 
Philippine Army lieutenant, 
snid washing clothes for Army 
and Navy personnel Wti5 more 



lucrative than teaching. A 
*iavandera*' can make as much 
PS P200 a ]nonth, he claimed.

The rnera presence in Manila of the Japanese surrender 
dalegafioh sent by the Enripbrof to negotiate terms with Gen- 
eral MacArhhur Was in itself an ironical piece of historic re- 
tribution. 

Manila represented the nadir of Japanese infamy In the 
Far East on two counts: 

I For having been ruthfessly bombed by them after 

General MacArthur humanely declared it an "open cify" to 
spare needless destruction, and (oss of life. 

2 For having been wantonly put to the torch by Jap "mad 

dog" demolition squads long after the city ceased to have 
any military value to MacArthur's liberating Forces. 

In the ruins of Manila, the Emperor's emissaries could see 
for themselves the fallacy of their own nefarious Greater East 
Asia Co-Prosperity eyewash, and the backwash of their other 
iL -itarred schemes to enslave the peoples of the Orient. 

Manila, too, was symbolic of the resurgent might of the 
Allied nations as represented by MacArthur's return to the 
once-beauKful city, being the first of the Far Eastern capitals 
to be liberated from the Japanese. 

The final irony of all, was the arrival of the Japanese en- 
voys at Nichols Field within plain view of the forlorn wreck- 
age of burned-out Jap planes still cluttering fhe edges of the 
airstrips, as well as decrepit Jap dump carh which starv- 
ing Ameffcan war prisoners were forced to hauK under the 
♦hreat of jfie bayonet and the bull-hide lash. 

It is as i^' slioulcj ^e. Selection of Manila as sffe of surrender 
re quirements for '^<ipa^i served notice to the worjd that justice, 
though if fn^y fo^Qw devious paths, was served in the final 
analysis, / ' 

U.S^ C0ngres5 To Act Op 
Tdll Employment' Bills 

WASillNGTON — President TrumaiVs recent re- 
queue for immeUiate expansion of unemployment insur- 
ance tx> (fuairantee 26 weeks of such pay at a national 
level of ?25 a week, and the so-called **full employment*' 
bill, will be the main subjects of debate when Congress 

•-reconvenes September 5. 

An article in the New 
York Times said these two 
issues rank among the most 
urgent problems of recon- 
version from war to peace 
economy. 

Althoup:h th3 main body of 
Congress will not reconvene im- 
mediately, some of its members 
will resume work this week, it 
was pointed out. 

Hearings on the emplojinent 
hill was scheduled to begin 
this week before the Senate 
Banking and Currency Com- 
mittee. On August 29, the 
Senate Finance Committee will 
open hearings on President 
Truman's recommendation. 

Two unprecedented steps will 
be considered in unemployment 
measures. First is a declara- 
tion that every employable 
person has a right to gainful 
employment. Secondly, estab- 
lishment of a wholly new sys- 
tem under which the President 
wculd prepare a ^^national" 
budget net only for routine 
Federal ex])enditures but re- 
commending Federal appropria- 
tion estimated to be necessary 
to meet prospective job deficit 
'n private employment. 

The expenditures w o u I d 
amount to the difference be- 
tween what was estimated as 
nuiximnm . employment to be 
expected from normal private 
employment sources and ''full 
em})loyment,'* proposed under 
the hill.

The Department of Interior 
announced yesterday the re- 
instatement of all 1940 elective 
officials in the provinces of 
Capiz and Mindoro by President 
Sergio Osmena. 

The return to government 
service of these officials, whose 
term of office was interrupted 
in December, 1941 by the Jap- 
anese occupation, is in line with 
the stated policy of the Presi- 
dent favoring the reinstatement 
of 1940 elective officials who 
have ' hot been disloyal to the 
Commonwealth government. 

The new appointees for Capiz 
municipalities replace those ap- 
pointed by the President upon 
the recommendation of Tomas 
Confesor, former Secretary of 
Interior. Those for Mindoro 
will succeed the officials ap- 
pointed by the PCAU of the 
U. S. Army.

Filipinos Entided To 
Independence, Says Adler 

By AL VALENCIA, Free Philippines Staff Writer 
The Filipinos are entitled to get their independ^ 
ence ''but they must get some help from the United 
States/' Brigo Gen. Julius Ochs Adler, vice president and 
general manager of the New York Times, declared yes- 

w terday. 

Adler, formerly assistant div- 
ision commander of the C. S. 
6th Division, arrived in Manila 
iast week as a guest of the Sec- 
retary of War and the Secretary 
of the Navy. He was with the 
6th Division in New Guinea 
when his health failed and 
forced his return to the U. S, 

Adler said he was here '^to 
observe," but declined to be 
specific, beyond adding that he 
hoped to go to Tokyo when 
Gen. MacArthur moves there. 

As executive of one of the 
most influential newspapers in 
the world, Adler is in a position 
to gauge public opinion better 
than most men. While refusing 
to say specifically how niuch 
help the U. S. should extend to 
the Philippines, he said it was 
his opinion such help would be 
sufficient to restore the Philip- 
pines to a position similar to 
their pre-war economy. 

**We took the Philippines 
under our wing and prepared 
them for independence," he de- 
clared. "But the war came and 
^they have had a setback. Their

Peace 'No Aladdin s 
Lamp/ Says Senator 

AUSTIN, TEXAS — Senator 
Tom Connally, Democrat of 
Texas, declared yesterday the 
"destiny" of the U.S. is to lead 
the world away from war. 

Speaking at a Jefferson Day 
dinner, Connally, who is chair- 
man of the Senate Foreign l^ela- 
tions Committee, called upon 
the United Nations" to work 
"side by side to save millions 
of human lives and permit the 
peoples of the earth to rebuild 
their tortured lands and shat- 
tered homes." 

Connally added in part: 

"Love of freedom and a de- 
termination that conquerors 
and aggressors should not do- 
minate the earth, crushed our 
savage and barbaric enemies, 

"We must remember that 
world peace will cost something. 
It is worth something. It will 
cost cooperation. It will cost a 
will to peace. The San Fran- 
cisco charter is not automatic. 
It possesses no magic. It is no 
Aladdin's Lamp. It will cost 
our constant efforts and the 
support of a peace-loving 
people." 



Osmena Proclaims Sunday 
As ^Victory Prayer Day' 

President Osrrena has deslgnafed Sunday, August 26, 
a dav of prayar "for the proper observance of the great 
Aired victory in which our people have the'r rightful share." 

His proclamation read in pari: 

"I call upon the people of the Philippines of all faiths \o 
pray in eternal gratitude to God for preserving the moral 
ntrengih of our people through the years of our suffering and 
for giving us the victory which will bring about a new world 
order of peace, security and righteousness. 

"We shall all pray so that He may guide the victorious 
nations into ihe paths of peace, and we may dedicate the day 
to the memory of those who have fallen in the night to make 
possible the total victory that we are celebrating." 



economy is down to zero. They 
cannot regain what they have 
lost without help from the 
United States." 

Adler said the American peo- 
ple appreciate the part which 
the Filipinos playecl in the war 
agaiiist Japari and are **recep- 
tive" to Filipino appeals for 
help. 

He said Senator Tydings did a 
good job bt"" feportii^'g to the 
U.S. the present plight of the 
Filipinos. ' However*, tie said, it 
woiild be a good thing if the 
other American memfe'ers of the 
Philippine Rehabilitation Gom- 
mission could eome tb 'the Is- 
lands and see conditions for 
themselves. ^ ' 

Adler said it was his impres- 
sion "it would be nolitical sui- 
cide for any Filipino leader to 
advocate a delay of independ- 
ence." On the other hand, he 
pointed out, "it is my impres- 
sion also that many of the 
thinking people want indepen- 
dence delayed." 

Any change in the indepen- 
dence program would have to 
come from the Filipinos them- 
selves, Adler stated, adding that 
the U. S. may be expected to 
consider sympathetically any 
move the Filipinos migh*: 
initiate for their well-being.

Japan Protests Rescue Of 
Allied War Prisoners ' 

A radiogram was received yesterday by General 
MacArthur's Headquarters from the Japanese Imperial

parachute rescue teams on Japanese prisoners of war 
camps at Mukden, Manchuria, Keijo, Korea and Hong- 

^kong. 

The official Japanese message 
said:

Betrayal of Norway Charged To Quisling 



OSLO— The ' xVorwegian state 
:;isrged Monday that Adolf 
Hitler personally ordered Vid- 
ttin Quisling to begin prepara- 
tions for invasion ' of Norway 
11 December 31, 1939. 

The charge was made at the 
jpsniug' of Quisling's trial on a 
iiarge of treason. The in(dict- 
~3nt against Norway's No. 1 
^ criminal carried nine milit- 
iiT and penal violations, five 
:rthem calling for the death 
.:^n3ity. 

Special Prosecutor Annaeus 
Schjoedt told the court that 
documents found in Germany 
lisclosed that Quisling con- 
■^rred with Hitler and Admiral 
^cRaeder in December, 1939. 
Jh e documents which 
S'^hjoedt v/aved before the 
X'iTt were brought from Ger- 
-any by an American officer 
three Norv/egian officials 
Ming under the auspices of 
office of Justice Robert H:. 
■*on, chief United States 
'•'^secutor for war criminals. 

Hitler gave the traitor per- 
jnal orders, Schjoedt said, to 
■"ijtjnvasion plans and pro 



mised to give him $40,000 a 
month for three months to be 
spent in spying out Norway's 
defenses. 

The special prosecutor said 
about April 1, 1940, Quisling 
was told in Copenhagen by a 
high-ranking German officer 
that the Nazis would attack 
Norway April 9. 

Quisling met with Hitler in 
Berlin December 14 and 15, 
1939, Schjoedt said, and con- 
v^inced him that it was neces- 
sary for Germans to intervene 
in Norway to forestall the Brit- 
ish. Schjoedt said Hitler actual- 
ly preferred to haye Scandina- 
via neutral but agreed to take 
steps on the basis of Quisling's 
recommendations. 

The prosecutor also charged 
Hitler personally had disclosed 
to his deputies that Germany's 
''audacious step" in invading 
Norway, was taken on the basis 
of repeated advice from Quis- 
ling who warned that delay 
would be risky. 

Following the reading of the 
indictment against him, Quis- 
ling defiantly demanded com- 



plete exoneration on the 
grounds that he had no ad- 
vance knowledge of the Nazi 
invasion, and claimed his gov- 
ernment was the only legal 
body during the occupation. He 
also claimed that King Haakon 
had forfeited his throne by 
leaving Norway for more than 
six months. 



Special P. O. Cancel 
Ready ForV-J Day 

A special canceller for souve- 
nir covers or envelops and 
postal cards, will be used by 
the Manila Post Office on the 
day of the formal surrender of 
Japan, it was announced yes- 
terday by the Department of 
Public Works and Communica- 
tions. 

There will be no special 
stamps but any of the Victory 
stamps may be used. The can- 
celler is circular in shape and 
bears the following inscription: 
"V-J DAY Unconditional Sur- 
render of Japan (date) Manila." 




Traffic Campaign 
Lessens Mishaps 

With the full cooperation of 
city school authorities, the edu- 
cational campaign of the Manila 
Police Department's traffic divi- 
sion, especially among the 
school children of the city, has 
greatly minimized traffic acci- 
dents, it was reported yester- 
day. 

Children in all city schools, 
from 7 -year-old tots to older 
boys and girls in the higher 
elementary grades, are daily re- 
ceiving instruction in traffic 
rules and regulations. Pupils 
are given lines about . traffic 
instructions which they are told 
to memorize and learn by 
heart, in addition to the il- 
lustrated information given 
them by their teachers. 

Boy traffic officers, provided 
with proper arm bands, will 
soon be appointed to handle 
school traffic, police officials 
said. 

These young traffic officers 
will assist Manila policemen in 
handling traffic in the vicinity 
of school to safeguard pupils 
from traffic accidents. 



AFP AC Announces 
Gl Education Plan 

Army Forces in the Pacific 
yesterday announced plans for 
a full-scale educational pro- 
gram for Army personnel in 
the Pacific area. 

Col. K. R. Dyke, chief of in- 
formation and education for 
AFPAC, said 70 percent of 
General MacArthur's forces 
will take advantage of the pro- 
gram which is to begin ^fter 
V-J Day. 

Units scattered from Hawaii 
to New Guinea and Tokyo will 
participate in the program de- 
signed to refresh men for fur- 
ther high school or college edu- 
cation and train them for 
peacetime work. 

Classes will be credited, as 
duty time though the program 
is voluntary and enrollment 
will not affect regular scheduled 
discharges or redeployment. 



men 

Allied forces, without giving 
previous notice, came by air- 
plane to some places under Jap- 
anese control for the purpose of 
making' contact with, or giving 
comfort to, prisoners of war or 
civilian internees, while ar- 
rangements for the cessation of 
hostilities have not yet been for- 
mally made. 

"Since the visits of Allied 
officers and men before such 
arranpr^ments are made, even if 
notified in advance, are likely to 
hamper realization of our desire 
to effect smoothly and satisfac- 
torily the ce.^ation of ho.stilities 
and the surrdllder of arms — we 
earnestly request you to prevent 
the recurrence of such incidents. 

**We have made those who 
came to Mukden, Keijo and

Army To End P. I. Civil Affairs On September 1st 



By September 1st all parti- 
cipation by the U. S. Army in 
the civil administration of 
the Philippines will be dis- 
conlfnued "as no long:er 
necessary," General Mac- 
Arthur announced yesterday. 
However, the Army will con- 
fimue- he said, to furnish as- 
sistance in the maintenance of 
pubMc order and the restora- 
tion of public utilities and 
other engineering: works. 

Gen. MacArthur said that 
he has taken this action in 
view of the fact that the 
executive, legislative and 
judicial branches of the €om- 
moriwealth Government have 



been completely reestablished, 
and are now functioning 
smoothly, and have assumed 
the responsibilities of caring: 
for the health and welfare of 
the people. 

"There is here another ex- 
ample," MacArthur stated, 
"of the splendid cooperation 
between the American and 
Filipino people that has per- 
mitted the latter in ten 
months time to emerge from 
the critical emergency oc- 
casioned by enemy occupation 
and the ravage of a military 
campaign — without starva- 
tion, without epidemic and 
without public disorder. 



''In this, fuliP eve&H Is due 
tlie strength of the Filipino 
people and the leadership of 
their public officials," he 
pointed out. 

Although he had brr;n 
authorized from the first days 
of the war to substitute a

authority, >Ia€Arthu]r de-

The Commonwealth ^overn^ 
rent's Koronadal Valley Set- 
jeneiit Projfict ifi upper Cota-

the Happy Valley, has been 
iei'astated, according to Con- 
gressman Ugalingan Piang of 
provLnce v/ho arrived in 
ilaoila last \^-'t^ek. 

Piang said , that the 24»000 or 
Riore settlers in the valley fled 
Eu various tov/ns for safety 
wtien the Japs retreated to 
tonadal during their encoun- 
kr with Pil-Atnerican force,-5. 

Farming, poultry, and Uve- 
itoek raising la Koronadal was 
tompletely abandoned by the 
e&lonists, Piang added- The 
vfaps burned their homes and 
k.:ed their storehouses. Dur- 
m the occupation, Koronadal 
V5S a source of food supply for 
IheJaps in Coiabato and near- 
provinces for practically 
?vei7 kind of crop was raised

The manager of the project,

Admiral Sherman said all 
v!if "^T^ ''''^^'^ confirmed 
vJ^' emissaries at Manila. 
ui I J Japanese battleships at 
the start of the war, only one 
now remains. This one is heavi- 
'y damaged and the crew has 
been removed. 

Of nine first-line airoraft 
carriers at the start of the 
%%ar, two are left— Hay aiaka 
ajid JaLiura^i— both heavily 
. clan-ji!!re!l and without crews, 

Tvvo light carriers are left 
out of seven. Heavy and light 
cruisers suffered similar des- 
truction and of the original des- 
troyer force of 165, only 26 are 
still in Commission. 

The Japanese fleet of 140 sub- 
marines has been reduced to 16, 
Admiral Sherman said* plus six 
German submarines which pos- 
sibly were transferred before 
V-E Day. 

'*The situation in which one 
of the miijor military powers 
of the tvarld is brought to 
defeat without defeat of its 
army is unparalleled in his- 
tory/' Admiral Shcrjnan de- 
clared. "It oreaies problems 
wliic?h will liave to be solved 
without guidance of iut$t ^isc- 
periencc." 
Sherman added that crews 
had been removed from Jap- 
anese ships in port largely be- 
cause of an acute shortage of 
fuel. He said his personal im- 
pression from talks with Jap- 
anese naval representatives was 
thcit there is very little food 
and an extreme gasoline short- 
age in Japan. 

The transportation system in 
Japan is also in bad shape, 
Sherman said, and apparently 
the entire economic structure 
^iras seriously affected by the 
Allied blockade.

NY, Harbor 

NEW YORK— The Navy De-

the mines. When the minclay- 
ing was discovered^ the port of 
New York was closed to all 
shipping for three days*

they were taken, according to 
Spencer Moosa, Associated

Olmsted was quoted as say- 
ing that Gen, MacArthur not 
only has been "thoroughly co- 
operative in the plan as a whole, 
but is prepared to move sup-

any last minute atrocities in the 
prison camps such as brjd oc-

the inmates themselves, with 
adequate n^edical attention and 
a very low incidence of hospital 
cases.

GOOD MEV/S AND A WELCOME OMEN 

The announcement by General Douglas MacArthur that he 
has direcl-ed Hie U, S. Amy fo discontinue further participation 
by September f, in the civil administration of the Phliippines, 
"as no longer necessary/ 1: Indeed good news for the Filipino 
people and a welcome omeit for their future. 

The f.^ct- i-hat their Commander-in-Chief has seen Fil" fo 
remove all remaining military controls from the Commonwealth 
Government in less than one year's time from the initial landings 
of MacA!-iI'^i;;*'s liberating forces in the Philippines, speaks well 
of the ability of fhe Filipino people to assume sole responsibility 
for return ng the country to normal life, despite unprecedented 
war destruction. 

In citing fhe splendid cooperation between the American 
and the Filipino people "that has permitted the latter In ten 
months time l-o emerge from the critical emergency occasioned 
by enemy occupation and fhe ravage of a military campaign," 
General MacArthur stated that "full credit is due the strength 

of the Fil'pino people and the leadership of their public offi- 

• I II 
cials. 

In concluding his tribute to the people of the Philippines 
contained in his order ending the Army's participation in the 
Commonv/eal^H's civil administration, General MacArthur de- 
clared that "Even throughout the period of enemy occupation, 
.great masses of the Filipino people he'd tenaciously to the 
threads of constitutional process, ready to die rather than to re- 
linquish this last bastion of their spiritual resistance." 

"That fhey have never been deprived of the right to 
consvitutionai government by the United States despite 
compelling reasons ofttimes for Its temporary sacrifice," Mac- 
Arthur said, "gives added strength to the democratic basis 
upon which fhe Filipino peopie may now build toward their 
future, poliHcai destiny." 

Such a realistic "beau geste" from fhe Supreme Allied 
Commander who was their ovn chosen Commander-in-Chief 
in pre-war days, means but one thing. 

Though their country was shattered by fire and by the 
sword, the rllipino people have Indeed proven themselves 
worthy of shouldering the sole responsibility for the mighty 
peacetime tasks whic h lie ahead.

"The Philippine Islands 
possess the material resources 
to support a great nation. It 
remains only for the people 
of the Commonwealth to in- 
sure its fruition by their own 
creative effort."

vicious Japanese propaganda

Britain To Replace 
Battle-Weary Troops 

LONDON — Prime Minister 
Attlee said yesterda:/ at a 
"Victory Over Japan" exhibi- 
tion, that Britain would conti- 
nue to send troops to the Far 
East to relieve other battle- 
weary units stationed there. 
"We have to complete the libe- 
ration of occupied territories,'' 
he said. 

Attlee described Britain's 14th 
Army in Burma as "men who 
fought against the worst man 
and nature could do to play 
their part in destroying one of 
the most evil forces which ever 
threatened humanity.'' 



Latest check up showed more 
than 360,000 persons were 
killed, wounded or made home- 
less in Hiroshima, while ca- 
sualties from the attack on 
Nagasaki exceeded 120,000, ac- 
cording to the broadcast. 

Since the explosion of the 
atomic bomb aifected an area 
19 miles in diameter in Hiroshi- 
ma, the Jap radio claimed, 
practically aU houses in this 
area were shaken or knocked 
down or reduced to ashes by 
fire. 

The broadcast said latest in- 
vestigation also revealed that 
the atomic bomb hit the fac- 
tory area of Uragaimi, on the 
northern side of Nagasaki 
station. 

Although topographically 
parts of the city of Nagasaki did 
not receive direct concussion 
from the explosion, practically 
all windows and roofs of build- 
ings in these parts were also 
shattered, so that almost the 
entire city was affected by the 
blast, Jap radio claimed. 

Figures so far available 
showed over 10,000 persons 
were killed in Nagasaki. More 
than 20,000 were wounded and 
over 90,000 were rendered 
homeless.

Japs Refused Permission f 
Rescuers To See War Prisoners 

CHUNGKING— An attempted rescue of Allied war 
prisoners at a Japanese camp near Keijo, capital of 
Korea, was foiled by refusal of the Japanese commander 
to let the rescue party see the prisoners, Henry R. Lie- 
berman, OWI news editor in China, reported yesterday. 

Lieberman said he and a party of 19 American 
Army men and three Koreans made the 1,000-mile 

flight to the Korean camp buti^ r^Tirj^ — -===^ 

were thv/arted in the rescue at- 



tempt by the coolness of the Jap 
commandant. 

Col. WilHs H. Bird, head of 
the rescue party, even asked 
the Jap commandant to intern 
his party but was refused. 

The rescue party was not al 
lowed to see any internees but 
the Japanese supplied them 
with 500 gallons of fuel for the 
return flight to Chungking. 

Arriving over the field near 
Keijo, radio messages were sent 
to the Jap commander identify- 
ing the rescue plane and asking 
for landing clearance. After 
the plane had circled for 2J 
hours, a guarantee of a safe 
landing v/as radioed by the 
Japanese. 

The party stayed for 24 hours 
attempting to persuade the Jap 
commandant to allov.^ them to 
see the prisoners, but to no 
avail.

pli'jh its "d'vfne mission" +o rule the world. 

And all during this war, even up to the monnenf of final 
cap'tMlation, fhey had been focf^d into believing that the 
An^e'ican fleet was sunk cou-iH^ss urn^^, that American cities 
were already occupl'^d, thai ths Japanese army and navy had

Af long last. :3nd in Gwful c\^n\^\ they can see for them- 
selves the frue course of this war. 

The shodf of the Emperor's Rj^cript ordering Japanese 
frrfnC:::^ forces to s^jrrender and t^a Ir^perial announcement that 
the iiScred soil of Japan would be occupied by Allied forces 
under fhe Supren^e Command cf General MacArthur, must 
truly have stiTed [-hem oiif of whal' little com.placity they still 
retained. 

The whole nation musi- be staggering under an emotiondl 
uphaavai. which vWtb each pa>sing day may become all the 
more intense because Japanes3 aufhorities, like rheir ill-starred 
predecessors, the German generals of 1918, had 50 completely 
conc:?Lilod the real gravity of fhe situation leading up to final 
defeat* 

Following arrival of General MacArthur in Japan and 
iicjninq of surrender on board the battleship Missouri In Tokyo 
bay, tho Japanese people must made to know still mo'-e 
cmpnatically, that Japan*s '*invincibiiity" and her ^'divine mis- 
tion" were but warped and selfish aims of her now discredited 
Ir^adcn, and that such views practiced as InstrumBnl'S of Japan^s 
fiatior^al policy, a^ was done so barbarously and rui^hlessly in 
the past, must forever be renounced, before Japan can hope

Despite Japanese Insistence that the dtoi-nfc bomb aEono 
iwas respon^.ible toi- her defeat, -.e^i power was one of the major 
determining factor., for they were well licked before that fsr-.|- 
atomic bomb eitploded over Hiroshinna, 

When ^hev lost their se^ power and control ov^er 
the We^tci'iT Pacific, the end oF their empire was In sight. 

Sea pov/er won for them their early victories, W was our 
sea power together with our control of the air thai- made it 
possible ro rsvene th^ results. 

No nation m history ever suffered as crushing a defeat at 
sea as did Japan this v/ar- She has one ba+fersd and crew- 
l^'^ss battleship left of twelver four crewless and equally battered 
c3rrior:i remaining of twenH-y; two heavy cruisers afloat of 
r'neteen and both of them damaged: no light cruisers out of 24; 
fwenty-six destroyers out of 165; and twenty-two submarines 
oiit of 140. 

The enemy's losses compare with our own announced losses 
throi^gh Way 31, 1945. of ore battleship, the Arizona; five 
large carriers and .ix '.mall ones, si)f heavy cruisers, three light 
cruisers, 60 destroyers and 52 submarines. 

of our losses, however, were offset many times by new 
cortstrciction, while ^he Japanese apparently were able to 
launch f^w new ships between December 7. 1941, and August 
14, 1945. 

There is no doubt that the atomic bomb has revolution- 
ized rtll concept-- of warfare aid of defense. It may well be 
that it will make obsolete most of our present weapons on land, 
end In tHe air, well as at sea. 

Bu* fofi^e record it should be pointed out ^ha^ in this war 
*ea power wes one of the major determining factors. That 
was ai true m the Atlantic as It was in the Pacific, 
* .Se« power, mcludrng carrler-bortie air powe^ spearheaded 
nearly every advance, provided air cover for almost every

a submarine "presumably be-

a radio message from Japanese 
General Headquarters to Gen. 
MacAi'thur said, according to 
Federal Monitors here. The

USS Franklin was wounded 
similarly and lost 832 killed or

The accident occurred 63 miles

When the Wasp was hit, she 
not only kept her place in the

''One of our fighters shot down 
the 'Jurlv' but its semi-armor- 
iv'ercine bomb had gone through 
our fli'^-ht deck," the officer re- 
counted. "The bomb started a 
lot of fire=? on the hangar deck 
and about ten of our planes iust 
melted there. We went to work

They were all out in a little

"We had suicide planes diving 
on us within 20 minutes after 
we took the bomb hit. but our

Sergeant Arthur Lincoln Bauer. 
"One came so close it looked

SANTO TOMAS IRADITION 

ThB recent awarding of an honorary degree of Doctor 
ot Lciws 1o General Douglas MacArthur by the University of 
Srtrfro Tomos, marked i-h^ revival of cultural traditions In 
Manila which Santo Tomds has kept alive for many centuries, 
despite much opposition and many obstacles In Its distinguished 
history. 

ffi paying tribute to this vital role played by Santo Tomas 
in fhe life cf the Philippines, as well as In Its key position as 
am* of the finest institutions of higher learning in all Asia, Sen- 
erril MacArthur said. In his speech of acceptance that it has 
'\+ood as a bulwark of Christianity In th^ East," 

'*For four hundred years, the soul of the University has 
mdintainod Its great and noble influence upon the generations 
who havo lived and died/' MacArthur pointed out. 

A'^ the oldest University under the American flag, Santo 
Tij»Ti'U stands today on the^ threshold of a new destiny under 
flu? lovereign f!ag of the Philippines, charged anew with the 
f^isk of enhanc:ng the dignity of man, the furtherance of man*s 
progress in the arts and sciences^ and the restoration 
ot cultural damage inflicted by the past years which were 
shrouded in the darkness of barbaric occupation and degrada- 
tion- 

Indeed, Santo Tomas stands now as it has for centuries 
fantore as the "Bulwark of Christianity in the East."

U, S* Destroyer 
Rejoins Fleet 

UNITED STATES NAVY 
YARD, MARE ISLAND, 
CALIF, — The Nav^^ announced 
yesterday that the destroyer 
LLS,S. isherwood, put out of 
action ]yy aerial torpedo and 
exploding depth charge last 
Aprils is ready to rejoin fleet. 

The navy said tbe ship was 
on anti-submarine patrol in 
waters south of Okinawa when 
a Kamikaze plane hit a e:un 
turret in rear section 6f ship 
killinjr entire gun crew and 
setting fires throughout ship. 
Seven fires were extinguished 
but the eip:hth smcldered in 
crushed depth charge barred 
from fire fighters by twisted 
steel and debris* 

The captain refused to move 
his sliip into the harbor at Ko- 
rama Rettn frr fear of damag- 
ing other vessels at anchor, and 
jrcfused aid from another craft 
which came alongside. 

When the smoldering depth 
charge finally exploded, it killed 
all tnen in the vicinity. The 
blaze was brought under con- 
trol shortly afterwards, and 
the destroyer limped back to 
the harbor with total of 83 of- 
ficers and men killed, missing 
or wounded during the 30- 
minute period. 



Friction Between Jap Officers 
And Men, Prisoners Say 

Friction between Japanese commanders and their 
men has been noted in the few Japanese who have straK- 
gled into U. S* 32nd Division lines last week, according 
to press reports yesterday^ 

The few who gave up reported 
that more than 1,000 Japanese 
holed up in isolated mountain 
pockets ih northern Luzon were 
willing to surrender but were 
prevented by their officers. 

AH possible means arc being 
taken to persuade Japanese 
troops in small hold-out units 
to give themselves up, these re- 
norts s^r-id. Tn northern Luzon, 
nbservation planes soared over 
isolated pockets and dropped 
radio receiving sets by para- 
chute. A note was attached to 
the radio urging the Japanese 
commander to tune in on Tokyo 
radio and learn that the Em- 
ppror had ordered capitulation. 

Relatively few Japanese have 
been taken prisoner since Hiro- 
hito decided to capitulate, it was 
disclosed.

General Tomoyuki Yamashita, bluistering *^Butcher 
of Bataan," opened formal negotiations yesterday for 
surrender of.his dwindling forces in northern Luzon. 

In a letter to Maj. Gen, William H. Gill, command- 
ing the U. S. 32nd Division, Yamashita said he had 
received orders from Tokyo to lay down his arms. 

The self -styled 'Tiger of 
Malaya," who became Japan's 
greatest field general of this 
wai' with capture of Singapore 
and other victories, iiddresscd 
GiU by name, and said he could 
enter direct negotiations as soon 
as he was authorised to do so 
by higher Japanese authorities* 

The message was received in 
the Kiangan area of Mountain 
Province where Yamashita's 
forces have been bottled up for 
two months since the American 
break-th]'ough into the Cagayan 
Valley.

Since we do nof yef know all fhat hcis happened In Japan

They must be TTiade to realize that they jnderiootc more 
"han they could possibly have accomplished under any con- 
ditions. Their war leaders by this demonstration must be en- 
tirely discredfted. 

Moreover when the capitulation c&remonles have been 
completed, the task of Anierica and her Allies m.+he Japanese 
Inlands, in the Pacific and on the Asiatic mainland v/ill be just

only be made to endure by a massive process of education in

transport and soup kitchens, a 
press di?;patch reported yester-

British officials have estimat- 
ed that nearly 18,000 Germans 
arrive i:i the capital daily, from 
Danzig, East Prussia, Silesia and 
Poland, w^hile still others are

Z L> arrivals enter the city 
mostly by rail, but some come 
in trucks, by barge, and afoot— 
and all are hungry. 

No Germans are permitted to 
enter Berlin to J?tay, on 
order from Allied authorities,

past AUied controls are unable 
to draw food allotments, 

Thus far, Americans have 
been able to provide Only 72 
percent of the food quotas in 
Berlin, due to wrecked rail 
communications.

Battleship Kongo Revealed As 

Victim of U.S. Sub 9ea Lion 

SAN FRANCISCO — The U. S. submarine Sea 
Lion, famed for sinking" the Japanese battleship Kongo, 
is back homo for an overhauling job. 

The submarine's achievement, one of the most spec- 
tacular of the entire Pacific war, marked the first time 
in history that a lone navy vessel of any type had sunk a 
Jap battleship unassisted 



The Sea Lion, according to 
her skipper, Commander EH 
Reich, was roaming the East 
China Sea when a four-battle- 
ship Jap task force was spotted 
44 miles north of Formosa, on 
the night of November 21, 1944. 

Protecting Jap destroyers 
^veaved in and out as they es- 
corted the capital ships. 

For eight hours the Sea Lion 
stalked and fought its prey. 
Skipper Reich was determined 
to bag the 30,000-ton battle- 
ship Kongo. He surfaced in 
order to retain maneuverability 
and clarity of vision, then de- 
cided to attack on the surface — 
an unusual feat in the case of 
heavy fleet targets. 

The Sea Lion's attack posi- 
tion was attained after tracking 
the task force for two hours, 
although a Jap destroyer, some 
J,500 yards distant, steamed 
between the sub and its group 
targets. 

Cmdr. Reich allowed the 
ead battleship to pass unmo- 
^^sted, saving his torpedoes for 
[he Kongo. Then he directed 
^^s sub on the port bow of the 
task force and fired a full salvo 
f six torpedoes from its bow 
t'Jbes when the Kongo was at 
^bout 3,000 yards range. 
Jour of the six tin fish found 
^^,eir marks. 

Evidently the enemy thought 
came in from the east, for 
l^e destroyer nearest us opened 
rapidly to the east of the 
^^^get ^roup. 



"We pulled away to about 
8,000 yards west of the enemy 
force and again paralleled the 
Jap ships. 

While the mortally wounded 
Kongo dropped astern, with the 
two destroyers on her far side, 
the Sea Lion moved in for the 
kill. 

A tremendous explosion 
blasted the waters before the 
second salvo of torpedoes could 
be released against the Kongo. 

Reich said that all trace of 
the battleship disappeared. 

"When we heard and felt the 
force of the explosion, we were 
afraid that the enemy guns had 
finally located us and taken us 
under fire. We thought our 
own ship had been hit. 

"No word came from the 
Captain for what seemed like 
hours, so we feared the bridge 
had been blown away," one of 
the sub's officers declared. 

Finally, the skipper's voice 
announced, "Our battleship dis- 
integrated." 



Navy Salvage Experts 
To Clear Japanese Ports 



WASHINGTON— Military and naval craft valued f 
at millions of dollars, as well as an estimated $600,- 
000,000 in sunken ships and cargo were salvaged during 
the war, the Navy Department announced yesterday 
coincident with a report that Commodore William A. 
Sullivan, Navy's famed salvage expert, is being sent to 
Japan to clean up wreckage littering ports there. 

Sullivan established a repu- 
tation for cleaning- up enemy 
harbors in Italy, France and the 
Philippines. Prior to Japan's 
surrender, the Navy's last big 
salvage job was the clearing of 
600 vessels from Manila Bay. 

Many of these had been sunk 
by Navy carriers and aircraft 
before the Philippines were in- 
vaded. Others had been sabo- 
taged by the Japanese. All told, 
over 600 officers and men were 
needed, for the Manila salvage 
operation. . 

Work in Manila Bay began 
immediately after the Lingayen 
Gulf landings last January, and 
within two weeks salvage crews 
were working in the bay as well 
as simultaneously fighting off 
Jap snipers. The snipers would 
svv'im to the wrecks at night to 
attack the salvage crews when 
they returned to work the next 
dav. 

Some of the re-floated vessels 
salvaged in North Africa, Italy, 
France, and in the Pacific were 
used again by the Army or 
Navy, while others were blov/n 
up or towed out of harbors to 
''graveyards." 

Now, Sullivan is preparing to 
tackle the biggest job of his 
career — the salvaging of scores 
of naval vessels and hundreds 
of merchant ships and small 
craft sunk or wrockod by Ameri- 
can sea cind air attacks in the 
Japanese home waters. 

U. S. Navy salvage crews, 
with Jap assistance will work 
together clearing out these ship^ 
to open haruors for American 
supply vessels, to establish safe 
channels for IJ. S. naval craft 
and to hasten the restoration of 
Japanese coastal shipping. 



incsanao Japs 
Now Giving Up 

MINDANAO— One hundred 
ten weary Japanese soldiers, 
first of about 5,000 who have 
agreed to surrender in central 
Mindanao, were shuttled across 
the Pulangi River near Valen- 
cia yesterday afternoon and this 
morning in' assault boats by 
Company C, 124th Infantry, 
and were immediately taken in 
trucks to the north coast for 
internment. 

A liaison plane reported 
sighting 20 to 25 stragglers from 
this group and 300 Japs from 
another group marching out of 
the mountains across the rice 
paddies. The first platoon of 
Conipany Q, which lost in bat- 
tle all but three men who came 
overseas with it 19 months ago, 
volunteered to handle the first 
prisoners. 

'*I feel we earned this job," 
said platoon Sergeant L. B. Mc- 
Clendon. "If the war had gone 
on one more day, I might not 
be here. V/e know now that 
500 Japs were lying in v/ait for 
our company in the mountains 
when we were called back from 
patx'ol, 

•'These Japs told us that we 
were just a few hundred yards 
short of their ambush and we 
didn't know they were there, 
when we got the news that Jap- 
an was willing to surrender," 
McClendon said. 



Braden Hopes To Do 
'More' At New Post 

BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTI- 
NA — U. S. Ambassador Spruille 
Braden said yesterday that he 
will not change his attitude on 
Argentine-U. S. relations and 
that he hoped to accomplish 
more in his new position as 
Assistant Secretary of State in 
charge of Latin-American af- 
fairs to which he has just been 
appointed. 

Braden has been persistent in 
his efforts to persuade the Ar- 
gentine government to fulfih its 
Mexico City and San Francisco 
conference obligations, and has 
also appealed directly to the 
Argentine people for support of 
democratic policies. 



Laval Queried On Vichy Deals 

Germany, 



PARIS — Pierre Laval, former 
Vichy premier of France, yes- 
terday was questioned for three 
hours concerning personal and 
political matters, in the Paris 
Prefecture Prison, press dis- 
patches reported. ^ , ^ 

Laval was asked about the 
origin of his private income, the 
position of Alsace Lorraine, the 
sending of French workers to 



Joseph Darnand's 
Vichy militia, the scuttling of 
the French fleet at Toulon in 
November, 1942, and Vichy 
measures against the Jews and 
the Free Masons. 

Laval's answers were said to 
have been vague, and that he 
told the examining magistrate 
he would give him written 

in rgpiy.

important step forward in re- 
lations betv/een those two coun- 
tries. 

Byrnes said, "we were kept 
informed of progress of deliber- 
ations in Moscow and we wel- 
come this development as a 
practical example of continuing 
unity and mutual helpfulness 
which should characterize acts 
of members of United Nations 
in peace as well as in war."

Japs And Aussies 
Reach Stalemate 

MELBOURNE — Surrender 
negotiations on Southwest 
Pacific islands have reached a 
stalemate and probably would 
remain that way until the sur- 
render document is signed by 
Japan, Australian Army head- 
quarters said yesterday. 

A state of armed truce has 
been declared throughout the 
Solomons, New Britain and New 
Guinea, although talks between 
envoys of opposing generals 
have been harmonious, it was 
reported. 

Latest Allied estimate of Jap- 
anese garrisons in the islands is 
86,000, but if the figures given 
by Japanese envoys are correct, 
the total may reach 140,000.

from the Pacific area. 

In cases of vessels thus dis- 
covered, Japanese titles may. 
under international prize law,

Japanese ofiicers estimate then'

this figure too high due to 
the disorganized state of the 
Japanese command in the val-

The 37th Division has desig- 
nated the towns of Gonzaga, 
Kapissayan and Dalayan as col-

four-motored transport planes 
were being tuned up for the 
scheduled hop tomorrow of 
thousands of battle-equipped 
airborne troops. 

It was also reported that 
eight American destroyers have 
been assigned to stand along 
the air route from Okinawa to 
Tokyo, to guide aircraft carry- 
ing occupation troops into Jap- 
an. This safety precaution has 
been taken, because of the pos- 
sibility of "bad weather," the 
dispatch said. 

As final preparations for the 
mass landings in Japan were 
being rapidly completed yester- 
day, Gen. MacArthur announced 
that the U. S. Eighth Army will 
participate in the occupation of 
the Tokyo area, under the com- 
mand of Lieut. Gen. Robert L. 
Eichelberger. 

The Eighth Army is sche- 
duled to make its landings at 
Yokosuka, and at Tateyamaho- 
30, flanking the east entrance to 
Tokyo Bay, next Saturday, Sep- 
tember 1st. 

Another development yester- 
day, was a warning to the Jap- 
anese issued by Halsey through 
his chief of staff, that the oc- 
cupation had better be without 
untoward incident as *'any vio- 
lence or resistance by the Jap- 
anese will be held to be a mu- 
tinous act against the orders of 
the Emperor and will be dealt 
with by force." 

Following the entry of Ad-

into Tokyo Bay, marines were 
scheduled to land at three tiny 
islands in the mouth of the bay, 
to carry out Halsey's orders 
that they totally neutralized

Palau Island Japs 
Are Still Holding Out 

GUAM-^ Japanese forces 
'iie by-passed Palau Islands are 
jtiO awaiting official orders 
'^m Emperor Hirohito before 
^iifiendering, the Navy Depart- 
'^^nt reported yesterday. 

The Navy also said it is in- 
■^Sligating reports that a U. S. 
™y flier who made a safe 
Mm% by parachute on Koro 
'Sland in ih^ Palaus on May

Canada; Anchorage, Alaska; 
Paramushiro, Kurile Islands; 
Tokyo, Shanghai, Hongkong, to 
terminal point at Manila. 

If the recomiTiendations are 
acqjepted. Pan American may 
extend its central Pacific route 
from Midway Island to Calcut- 
ta, India, flying by way of 
Tokyo, Shanghai!, Hongkong 
and Bangkok, Thailand. Pan 
American will also be author- 
i7,ed to provide service from 
Manila to Singapore and Bata- 
via^ Java, and also from Nou- 
mea, New Caledonia, to Sydney, 
By recommending that Pah 
American Airways fly the Paci- 
fic to Calcutta, examiners out- 
lined the first world- encircling 
route by a United States airline. 
Pan American already hag been 
authorized to fly to Calcutta by 
way of the Atlantic and Europe, 
Examiners in their report 
emphasised that it was not an 
opinion or a decision of the 
Civil Aeronautics Board, but an 
advisory report- Hearing!^ will 
be held later after which the 
CAA board*s decision will be 
submitted to President Truman 
for approval. 

Opening of services across the 
Pacific will finally depend upon 
the granting of landing rights 
by the nations designated on 
the routeS- 

Pan American Airways ope^ 
rated a trans-Pacific mail and 
passenger service for four years 
prior to the war with Japan. 
One of Pan American's clippers 
was destroyed by Jap machine- 
gun fire at Hongkong when Japs 
attacked that British port.

THE FITTER TEA OF GENERAL YAMASHITA 

He called himself the "Tiger of Malaya** when he swept 
into Singapore in fhf? early sfages of the war but he canne 
to be known as the "Sopher of Lu3:on" to the SI Joe's who 
hed run him to earfh -n the crags of the Caraballo Mountains. 

He said told '■he British commander at Singapore — 'All 
I v/ant to hear from you Is Yes or No.' I expect to put the 
same question to ls//dcArthur" when he came with much fan- 
fare and cameras grinding and some of the best troops In 
the Japanese amy +o defend the Philippines against the pro- 
mised return of General MacArthur. 

But yesterday vvith General MacArthur flying to Tokyo 
as Supreme Allien Commander to accept the surrender of all 
Ihe Japanese empire. Yanrtashita humbly wrote to Major Gen- 
eral William H. Gill ^f the 32nd Division: '1 wish to add my 
hc-artfelt 'gratitude to fou, fully cognizant of the sincere efforts 
and deep concern you continuously have shown with reference 
to cessation of hostilities, as evidenced by the various steps 
and measures you have taken.*' 

On many fronts ^11 over East Asia, Japanese commanders 
are surrendering the !:mpire while in a hole, in the mountains of 
the Philippines sih he man who had boasted loudest and 
longest that he would save it on the beaches of Leyte, and 
♦hen on Luzon, but who only succeeded In leading 400,000 of 
ill*; cQi^ntrymen to 'heir deaths. 

And With the jnnouncement Ohiy yesterday, that Lieut. 
Gen; Wajnwright will be personally present to receive his 
surrender^ Yamashit^'i cup of bitterness must truly be filled to 
overflowing. _

jap 3 Give Up 
lowly at Iwo 



IWO JIMA— American droops 

Iwo Jima have taken 1,259 
Jap soldiers as prisoners since 
island was captured last 
March, and an uncounted num- 
ber of other soldiers are 
{^lieved to be entombed in the 
island's extensive underground 
tunnel system, a press dispatch 
reported yesterday. 

Iwo is beheved to be prac- 
tically cleared of the Japs", es- 
pecially since the extensive se- 
ries of interlocking tunnels un- 
d.r Mt. Suribachi have been 
sealed up with concrete. 

The Japanese never had been 
able to construct a highway up 
Suribachi to take advantage of 
natural gun emplacement posi- 
tions that control the entire is- 
land from the summit. 

However, U. S. Seabees built 
a substantial motor highway up 
the summit in five days, using 
newly set block and m.asonry 
as part of the road base. 

U. S. guns, radio, and radar 
equipment atop the mountain 
now control the sea and air ap- 
proaches in all directions. 

Although Iwo is now^ com- 
pletely quiet, sporadic bursts of 
anti-aircraft fire from other is- 
lands, such as Chichi Jima, still 
testify to enemy activity.

''Some experimenters went

up so brightly they worried for 
a month that we had miscal-

cooked. 

''The effect of the bomb was 
seen in three states, over 200

across" like a great oil fire— a ball of smoke and flames three miles 

f^I^^ physicist's description of 
tne explosion, in a letter to his 
sa^d-^ "^^de public yesterday, 

"Twenty miles from the 
tower which held the bomb, I 
was bhnded by a terrific silver 
white flash. The sky, lit up 
with bright yellow light ap- 
peared white, the yellow grad- 
ually became darker, turning 
to orange in the sky. 

"I saw white clouds from 
above the gadget caused by the 
sudden expansion following the 
blast wave. The expansion 
cools the air and fog clouds 
form, which we had expected. 

"The orange got deeper, but 
near the gadget it still was a 
bright big orange flaming ball, 
like a mass. This started to 
rise, leaving a column of smoke 
like the stem of a mushroom. 

"The orange mass continued 
to rise and then to fade and 
flicker. The great ball of smoke 
and flame, three miles across 
like a great oil fire, billowed 
and churned, now black smoke, 
now orange flame. 

"Soon the orange died out, 
and only the churning smoke 
remained, enveloped in a won- 
derful purple glow. Gradually 
this disappeared, the ball of 
smoke rising majestically slow- 
ly upward, leaving a trail of 
dust and smoke behind. 



"Suddenly there was a sharp, 
loud crack followed by resound- 
ing thunder. A man at my side 
wondered what it was. He had 
forgotten that sound takes much 
longer than light to traveJ. 
What he had seen so far was a 
silent picture — a sound track 
which was one minute and 40 
seconds late. 

"I knew the bomb was a suc- 
cess. Big as it appeared at 20 
miles, I was still more im.- 
pressed with the solid sound of 
thunder echoing in the hills. 
Men jumped up and down, 
shook hands and congratulated 
each other — guessing at the 
energy released. 

"Later, pictures and observ- 
ations showed an area almost 
covered by a great green glass 
like glaze, formed by the melt-

Premier Says Reasons For Japs^ 
Defeat To Be Examined At Diet 

SAN FRANCISCO— An official Japanese Domei 
broadcast from Tokyo yesterday said that Premier Ma- 
ruhiko Higashi-kuni at a press conference, attributed 
Japan's defeat to '*the rapid deterioration of the nation's 
fighting strength." He promised that reasons for this 
deterioration will be revealed in a "most outspoken man- 
ner" at the forthcoming session of the Imperial Diet. 

Federal monitors, recording 
the dispatch, said the Premier 
warned that "the whole struc- 
ture of Japan can be safeguard- 
ed only through strict observ- 
ance of the Imperial Rescript 
terminating the war and 
through the faithful execution 
of the Allied terms for sur- 
render."" 

Discussing reconstruction, 
Higashi-kuni said the first step 
was "national repentance." He 
said "the government would 
make every effort to stabilize 
the nation's livelihood" and 
urged the people to exert them- 
selves in producing foodstuffs 
"in view of the possibility that 
importation of food from 
abroad will not be permitted." 

He also declared that free- 
dom of speech and press would 
be promoted, and political acti- 
vities of the police will be re- 
stricted, adding: 

"The Japanese nation can at- 
tain future prosperity only 
through cooperation with other 
nations and contributing to the 
cultural development of the 
world." 

Another Domei dispatch, yes- 
terday, reported that Lt. Gen. 
Kanji Ishihara, adviser to the 
East Asia Federation, writing 
in Tuesday's newspaper "Yo- 
miuri Hochi" said the "greatest 
reason for the Japanese defeat 
was deterioration of the nation's 
morality." 

"It is of importance that a 
thorough study be made as to 
why we lost the war," Ishihara 
said and added: 

"This should be done in 
every conceivable fields — milit- 
ary, diplomatic, government, 
economics and morality — and 
the findings should be inculcat- 
ed in every individual." 

Constructive freedom of 
speech and associations, Ishi- 
hara wrote "has always been 
the desire of leaders of the East 
Asia Federation" but he said 
that "it has not been realized 
because of obstruction on the 
part of certain military and 
government circles." 

Ishihara declared that he 
"realized, sharply, that Japan 
lost to China in morality as 
well," and that the "Japanese 
hereafter should be humble and

^Watch'YourCa/ 
Racket Re-Opens 

The "watch - your - car" 
racket which became notor- 
ious during pre-war days, re- 
appeared in even more com- 
plex form with the supposed 
car watcher being in league 
with robber gangs, according 
to police yesterday, following

Davis returned to his truck 
and found Vasquez gone.

pieces of equipment and spare 
parts as well as personal ar- 
ticles he had in the truck. 

Enlisting the aid of the 
police, Davis came across

rounded up and will be 
charged with theft.

Press Conference In 3 Years 

CHUNGKING— After a "briefing:'^ conference with 
U. Army comrades at v^hich he was brought up to date 
with events since his capture, General Wainwright held

I have had very little direcf^' it it it

contact with my country or its 
official agencies for over three 
yearsj but such contacts here 
and there as IVe had, has 
caused me to believe the Ad- 
ministration, the War Depart- 
ment and the American people 
accepted my dire disaster with 
a forebearance and generosity 
which are perhaps unique in 
the experienpe of any defeated 
commander-*' 

Maj. Gen. Edward P, King, 
who signed the Bataan surrend- 
er in 1942+ and arrived with 
Wainwright, also spoke to the 
newsmen. King said: 

"Our official release from 
prison came Sunday before last 
when Japanese sentries in our 
camp 'about faced,' They were 
no longer responsible for guard- 
ing us, but protecting us*" 

Maj, Gen. William F, Sharp, 
who commanded U. S. forces in 
southern Philippines before 
Pearl Harbor, said that in the 
Manchuria prison camp, Rus- 
sian liberating forces gave 
Americans the job of guarding 
their former Jap sentries, 

A Russian captain, on the day 
of their liberation, ordered the 
Japanese sentries to stack their 
arms. The Russian then asked 
for one American captain and 
ten privates. Grabbing rifles 
from the stack and giving them 
to the Americans, the Russian 
captain said: 

"From this day you are free. 
These Japanese are your pris- 
oners. Now march them around 
and take them to the guard 
house." ' ^ .

WASKIXGTON _ President 
iriiman yesterday released the

Japanese attacks on Pearl Har

^arp criticisms of General 
(jcorgfe C. Marshall, Army chief 
of staff, Maj. Gen. Waiter C 
^liort, commander of the Army's 
{Hawaiian department at the 
tinie of the attack. Admiral 
Ilarald Stark, naval chief of 
operations at the time, and 
admiral Husband E. Kim- 
j„el, former commander of V C 
naval forces at Pearl Harbor. 

Truman simultaneously re-

N o courtmartials were 
recommended, and Truman de- 
clared he had nothing to say 
on that subject. However, if 
a court martial was necessary, 
the officers named, would be 
given prompt and fair trials, the 
Pre^^ident said. 

Stimscn, in his report, said 
that while Kimmel and Short 
'w^r-^ cm very friendly terms 
and in frequent communication, 



exchange of information as well 
as consultation in other respects 
at Hawaii, between the army 
and navy, was inadequate." 

The underlying cause of the 
error of judgment which per- 
mitted Japan's sneak attack 
"was G'*n. Short's confidence 
that Japan would not then at- 
tack Pearl Harbor," Stimson as- 
serted. He contended that since

Osmena and Gen. 




ABOARD USS SOUTH DA- 
KOTA, TOKYO BAY — The 
Yokosuka Naval Base will be- 
come the first Allied shore base 
in Japan, Fleet Admiral Chester 
Nimitz announced yesterday. 

Nimitz also revealed that he 
would shift his flag from the 
South Dakota to the battleship 
Missouri, Admiral Halsey's 
:!agship, on Sunday. 

Receiving the. press shortly 
alter his arrival in Tokyo Bay, 
Ximitz said, ''Not much is left 

the Japanese Navy, and what 
is left is of little value." The 
Admiral's observation was taken 
as indirect comment on China's 
reciuest for the remnants of the 
Jap fleet. 

Nimitz, who credited sea 
power 'for the surrender of Jap- 
^n. said that in so doing he 
vas not detracting from the 
•ecoi'd' bf any other service. 

The Admiral said the navy 
had to seize bases from which 
atomic bombs could be drop- 
ped on Japan, that without 
the iiavy there could be no 
iidvance! "Time may change, 
tactics may change, but sea 
power is to remain." 
He praised the teamwork of 
the Allied forces, with special 
tribute for Admiral Sir Bruce 
Eraser's British fleet. He also 
•complimented the U. S. Naval 
Reserves, whom he declared to 
indistinguishable from a TJ.is.

Perry FlajS to Fly at Surrender 

TOKYO BAY — ^The United States flag which Commo- 
dore Perry flew on his mission to open trade with Japan 
92 years ago, was delivered to Admiral Halsey's Third 
Fleet yesterday, for unfurling at Japan's formal surrender 
Sunday (Japanese time) press dispatch reported. 



on 



Gen. Wainwright was met by 
President Osmena, who warmly 
embraced him, and by Maj. 
Gen. Willoughby, G-2, repre- 
senting General MacArthur. 

Wainwright was accompanied 
on his flight from Chungking 
by his chief of staff, Brig. Gen. 
Lewis C. Beebe, and by Lieut. 
■Gen. Sir Arthur Percival, the 
British commander of Singa- 
pore up to the time of its fall. 

Others who returned with 
Wainwright, and who shared 
his imprisonment for over 3 
years in various Formosan and 
Manchurian prison camps, were 
two of his aides, Lt. Col. John 
Pugh and Maj. Thomas Dooley, 
and his orderly, Sgt. H. Carroll, 
all of whom were captured with 
him at Corregidor. 

Wainwriffht^s chief topic 
of conversation on the longr 
flight in from Chungking was 
about the ''big fight" on 
Bataan and later on Corregi- 
dor, and seemed to want to 
discuss little else. 

It was previously announced 
that Wainwright had imme- 
diately accepted the invitation 
of General MacArthur to be 
present when the Supreme Al- 
lied Commander receives the 
formal signing of surrender by 
Japan aboard the U. S. battle- 
ship Missouri in Tokyo Bay on 
Sunday. 

Gen. MacArthur's invitation 
was also extended to Gen. Per- 
cival and to Gen. Wainwright's 
aides.

Army To Release 6 Million Men 
// Japan Occupation !s Peaceful 



WASHINGTON— If the occu- 
pation of Japan is carried out 
peaceably and without fighting, 
nearly 6,000,000 men will be 
discharged from the U, S. Army 
by July, 1946, the War Depart- 
ment "announced Wednesday. 

Army spokesmen testifying 
before the House of Represen- 
tatives. Military Affairs Com- 
mittee said that the next few 
days during which General 
Mac Arthur assumes control of 
Japan will determine the pro- 
gram for bringing Army men 
back home. 



Major General I. W, Edv;ard,- 
Chiei:' of the Arnriy's demobilise, - 
tion program, told Congress- 
men: "The day General Mac^ 
Arthur tells us that we will not 
have to ftght in Japan we will 
stop sending men to the Pacific 
who have 60 points or morF 
(at present 85 points are re- 
quired for discharge). 

By July 1946, Army spokes ^ 
men said the Army will num- 
ber 2,500,000 men who will bf 
distributed all over the world 
with the occupation force tri 
Japan expected to be about

Eist^nhower Holdi^ Parley 
To Plan Postwar Germany 

FRANKFURT, GERMANY— Ruthless eliminatit^i 
of the la^st traces of Nazism and eventual reconstruct iou 
of Germany on a democratic basis, were the themes at 
the opening session of a three-day conference on Am-ri- 
can military g-overnment being held here. 



General Eisenhower and his 
chief deputy on the Allied Con- 
trol CounciL Liieut. Gen. Lucius 
B. Clay, were the principal 
speakers, it was announced. 

"Everybody must understand 
what we are doing in Germa- 
ny,'' General Eiijenhower said, 
"The Army's number one job 
was to defeat Germany^ but 
now its purpose in life is to 
support the military govern- 
ment. 

*'The Army in general is 
committed to support American 
policy and all militai-y forma- 
tions must cooperate with the 
military government in cari-ying 
it out." 

He issued a directive forbid- 
ding divisional and regimental 
commanders from issuing 
orders to burgomasters and 
stressed orders to community 
burgomasters would be made 
by the heads of the military 
government detachments con- 
cerned- 

The opening session of the 
conference was held behind 
closed doors but after a protest 
was lodged it was agreed cor- 
respondents would be allowed 
to attend future meetings. 

General Clay warned that 
*'our difficulties will increase as 
reparations program get under 
way and Germans begin to see 
their capital assets being re- 
moved." 

Provision for payment of re- 
parations is provided in the 
Potsdam declaration by remov- 
al of industries which might be 
built up into another war ma- 
chine. The declaration also 
provides for Allied control of 
Germany until the German

pvTiif ^^^h^year to keep naval 
aviation a dominant factor in 
world peace insurance. 

fv.Jf^'''.'^^?'' Mitscher advocated 
ohf ^'^^^ planes 

should be added during the next 
year. He pointed out that new 
weapons have been developed, 
including a jet-propelled air- 
cratt designed to operate from 
can-iers. At least two new 
nghters and two radically new 
dive and torpedo bombers are 
under development, with most 
of them about ready for action 
Speaking on the role of car- 
rier supremacy in the Pacific, 
Mitscher said: 

. rf?^^^^^^^^^ supremacy was es- 
tablished by the ability of fast 
I carriers to stay in one area, and 
to meet and whip any opposition 
I that enemy air power could 
I marshall against us. 
I "The result was that carrier 
I supremacy made impotent Jap- 
, anese air power and destroyed 
his fleet. Carrier supremacy, 
m the face of land-based air 
power, carried our offensive 
across the Pacific from the Gil- 
berts to the Philippines. 

'^Earlier in the war, carrier 
supremacy frustrated the ene- 
my's supreme invasion attempt 
at the Battle of Midway. Car- 
rier supremacy proven in the 
successive battles of the Phil- 
ippine Sea, made possible the 
acquisition of bases from which 
the enemy could be pressed 
back against his homeland. 

^'Carrier supremacy also made 
possible the invasion of Okina- 
wa, and by breaking the 
enemy's air power in the home 
islands made it possible for 
B-29's to bring in their devas- 
tating loads at low altitude."

Navy Hospitals 
Have Heavy Load 

WASHINGTON— Navy hos- 
pitals will be taxed to the limit 
within the next few months 
because of long term injury 
cases and the steady evacuation 
of wounded from the Pacific, 
Vice Admiral Ross T. Mclntyre, 
surgeon-f^eneral of the Navy 
said Tuesday. 

Fifty four naval hospitals 
were caring for more than 
89,000 patients through August 
15, Mclntyre declared- 

Almost l!i,000 Navy and 
Marine Corps wounded remain 
to be brought to the U.S. chiefly 
from Hawaii and the Marianas^ 
he said. 

The fact that 97 out of every 
100 men wounded had survived 
could be attributed to the new 
uses of whole blood and blood 
plasma and to swift evacuation 
by air, Mclntyre slated. 

Since . Pearl Harbor, Navy 
ann^utafions have totaled 2,300;

Weeks Continuous Action 

WASHINGTON— The heavy cruiser USS Portland 
slugged it out with the Japanese for 20 weeks without j w i • ci 

letup even for repairs in the Philippines area, and to Tortured Marine Flyer 
gain a place in the list of "Navy greats,*' it was an- Found At Omori Camp 
nounced yesterday. 

Veteran of 20 major battles, the Portland attacked 
continuously, from October 12, 1944, to March 1, 1945, 
the Navy DepartTnent disclosed- 

Captain Thomas C W. Seat- 
tle, the Portland's skipper, said 
of this period: 

*^The Portland operated con- 
tinuously in advanced areas 
with active enemy air, surface 
and submarine opposition^ witn- 
oat opportunity for repair, per- 
sonnel relaxation, adequate re- 
pletiishment of stores and pro- 
visions, or receipt of maiL 

During this campaign, the 
cruiser participsited in the Ley- 
te landings, the battle of bun- 
gao Strait, J>nd the , carrier 
ftrikes on Luzon airhelds and 
Visayan shipping She ^Iso 
took P^i't in the Mindoro land- 
ing the Lingaycn Gulf cam-, 
naign and the assault on Cor- 
regtdor, in Manila Bay. / 

The ship destroyed IS enemy 
nlane^v and assisted in downing 
three more. She sank two Jap- 
anese destroyers and ^jne crui- 
tev damaged one battleship 
badly and assisted m sinking 
tvvn battleships and two de- 
slroyen^, end damaging one 
heavy cruiser. 

In addition, the Portland 
n u'tieipated in the third battle 
t savo. in August, m2-an 
oper^ition which toPPed hex out- 
Btanding record. In t.ns battle, 
iu^ after sinking one Japane^^e 
destroyer ^nd setting a cruiser 
afire the Portland was rammed 



by torpedo on the starboard 
quarter. 

The Portland's personnel re- 
ceived more citations for this 
battle than for any of her other 
many encounters. 

This hit jammed the rudder 
so that the ship could travel 
only in circles. Completing the 
Ih'dt circle, the Portland fired 
on an enemy destroyer^ setting 
fires in it. Later, still on a 
circular course, the Portland 
opened fire On another Japanese 
destroyer and sent it to the 
bottom.

school teachers in conabatting 
the increase of juvenile delin- 
quency in the city, it was an- 
nounced by the ofTlce of chief 
of police yesterday. 

As early as the day he took 
office as provost marshal and 
chief of police, CoL Holland 
has shown his keen interest in 
nieeting and solving the prob- 
lem of juvenile delinquency in 
Manila by segregating juvenile 
[yfTenders from adult criminals^ 
activating the city's playgrounds 



and by organizing the Juvenile 
Bureau, which is in charge by 
an American officer who had 
previously engaged in juvenile 
delinquency work in the States* 

Col. HoUand also sponsored 
the 1945-46 City of Manila Box- 
ing Amateur Championship and 
also encouraged the organiza- 
tion and opening of Boy's Clubs, 

CoL Holland recently recom- 
mended the establishnient of a 
juvenile court to try juvenile 
cases which, if carried out, 
would afford young ofTcnders 
the opportunity to have more 
sympathetic treatment and un^ 
deriitartding of their cases.

The Army Eoarcrs report on the Pearl Harbor a | yailkS at , - .

time when the Army and Navy desired time which 
would allow them to get prepared, Hull, presented" the 
Japanese with proposals which U.S. military and naval 
authoi'itiea considered an ultimat/um, and that it 
*'touehed the button'' which started the war. 

"that the question of our na- 
tional defense from that point 
on should be e.specially the ^ 
concern of the Army and ' 
Navy."

HLiil's letter revealed that on 
November 24, 1941, he reviewed 
the darkened situEition and "I 
indicated that the question of 
our national defence from that 
point on should be especiaUy 
the eoneern of the Army and

Tliat wa^i the day before Hull 
deli\ered the Ameriean propo-

Stimson last September, hav- 
ing before him some of the 
sialements which appeared in 
the Anriy inqiury board's re-

In reply. Hull declared that 
fho events occurred in this 
fashion! 

On Noveniber 20, Japanese 
negotiators in Washington 
nrcsomc^d to the United States 
a set of proiDOf^^als by which this 
country would have joined 
Japan in securing what both 
countries might want in East 
Asia and without renouncing

The United States would have 
agreed to furnish oil and other 
supplies to Japan and would 
have discontinued its aid to

YOKOHAMA— One of the 
mo$t impressivi! meetings of 
the Paeific war took place 
here Friday when Lieut. Gen. 
Jonathan M, WainwHeht, for 
three and a half years a pris- 
oner of the Japanese, sat 
down with General of the 
Army Douglas MacArthur, 
The meeting took place in the 
rjrivate dining room ot the Kew 
Grand Hot el , where General 
MacArihui' and members of his 
st&fT awaited General Wain- 
wright^s arrival- 
There was no ovation. Mac- 
Arthur just wrung Wainwright's 
hand and s'M simply: "Well, 
I'm glad to .see you!^' 

Wainwright, obviously in fine 
spirits after his recent visit to 
Manila, appeared to swallow 
momentarily before he an- 
swered: **Wen, I'm glad to see 
you, too!'* 

That was all. Handshakes 
and introductions followed and 
then General Sir Arthur I'er- 
cival, former British command- 
er at Singapore J also joined the 
group. 

Wainwright, who succeeded 
General MacArthur in com- 
mand of American and Filipino 
forces at Bataan and Corregidor» 
after MacArthur was ordered to 
Australia J arrived here by air 
at MacArthur's invitation to be 
present at the signing of Japan's 
sLU'render. 

Wain Wright expressed his 
gratitude to the American peo- 
ple for their "generous and 
sympathetiL- understanding of 
the dire misfortune which be- 
fell me in the Philippines jn 
May of 1942," 

''Through the kindness and 
generosity ot my great com- 
mander, General MacArthur, 1 
am here to witness on Sunday 
the greater misfortune of my 
enemy,'* he declared.

Th© new ruler of Japan does not claim to be descended 
-^fom the Sods. Nor is he even theoretically absolute, for as 
Ihe Supreme Allied Commander In the Pacific he Is subject to 
several governments. As an American Army officer he is sub- 
set to the War Department, the President, Congress and the 
American people. But one judges that the qualities he has 
^f^herlted from his merely human ancestors wjII enable him to 
yse his comparatively limited authority in a manner satisfactory 
,o his countrynnen and to their Allies. 

Douglas MacArthur has travelled as he says, ''a long hard

and it may have been more bitter for him to leave Corregldor

U.S. Forces In Germany 
Will Be Cut To 400,000 

BERLIN — General Ei.senhower i^iiid here today 
that the American occupation force of 2,500,000 in 
Germany will be reduced to about 400,000 men well 

^^before the end of winter. 

Eisenhower said that the e.s- 
tinintcd 400,000 might be fur- 
ther reduced later provided the 
Gennans did n^ore for them- 
solvers and It^ss policing became 
necessary. Ho declined to pre- 
dict how long Allied occupation 
of Germany would last saying 
that this was a matter for high- 
er government policy, but added 
that Americans did not c>;pect 
to stay here forever. 

Eisenhower said the biggest 
current tosk in Germany is ,sus^ 
taining the nation with food, 
fuel and iihelter this winter. He 
further satd that food, especial- • 
ly canned meat, wiU have to be 
imported trcm the United 
States, 

Regarding German coal pro- , 
duclion, Eisenhower said it 
would.be distributed among li- 
berated countries on priority 
bas^is vvith Gernu-m needs being 
filled last. It is known that 
HoJlarid, Belgium, France and 
Lusjcmbourg have critical fuel 
problems.

Health and Public Welfare thui 
it does not have sufTicient funds 
to run the City Hospital of

It was reported that the City 
Hospital is taking care of 250 
patients daily while the South- 
ern Islands Hospital has only 50 
patients. These hospitals had 
been reestablished by the Phil- 
ippine Civil Affairs Unit of the

The two cruisers were part 
nf the Third Fleet which at- 
tacked Formosa airfields to 
neutralize Japanese air strength 
prior to the United States land- 
ings in the Philippines. It was 
during this mission when they 
were struck by Japanese tor- 
pedo planes. 

The Houston took two tor- 
pedo hits* one amidship and 
another in her stern. Canberra 
was put out of action by tor- 
pedo smashing into the boiler 
rooms. 

The Houiiton was towed out 
of the battle area by the cruiser 
Boston and emergency salvage 
measures kept her afloat. Later, 
the Pawnee took over the tow- 
ing and the Canberra also 
joined the Houston on the re-

received emergency repairs,

Free Entry For 
Food Into Manila 

In order to increase the food 
supply in Manila and to elimi- 
nate petty abuses on the part 
of law-enforcement authorities 
on the highways in connection 
with the transportation of food 
to the city, Col. H. Gilhouser, 
in charge of the Emergency 
Control Administration, issued 
an order yesterday allowin^r the 
free entry of food from the pro- 
vinces. The order stated that 
hereafter, no permits of any 
kind shall be re<^uircd of per- 
nus bringing food supplies into 
Maniiii. 

In the case of food going to 
the provinces and elsewhere, 
I permits are necessary before it

According to Gilhouser, the 
purpose of controlling the out-

food supply in the city and at 
the same time to depress the 
current high prices. Goods 
moved from Mfinila without the

Japanese Sought Key 
To Atom Bomb Too 

TOKYO— A month bofore the 
first United States atomic bomb 
was dropped on Hiroshima, 
Japanese bcientists were work- 
ing on a similar project, Jap- 
ane^-c newspapermen revealed 
yesterday. 

There was no indication how 
far 0long Japanese were in 
aton:ic research, FresJS dis- 
paiche,^ i^aid reports of a Jap- 
anese atomic bomb were pub- 
lished in the Tokyo prCKs in 
July, 

J^ipanese newsmen also re- 
vealed tlrat a Japanoye picket 
boat Hashed the wanting to 
Tokyo of the carrier force 
which brought Lieut. Gen, 
J;.MTies Doolittle's raiders within 
rsnfije of Tokyo In April, 1942, 
The picket boat sighted the 
carrier force 600 miles off the 
Jtipanese coast and managed to 
ge* a warning to Jajian before* 
it -as attacked and .■simk by 
U, cruiser<>- 

The newsmon said some sur 
vivors of the picket boat were 
picked up and subsequently de- 
corated by Emperor Hirohito. 
The picket boat was the direct 
cause of the large number of 
losses among Doolittle's flyers. 

Surmising that it had man- 
aged to flash a warning, 
Doolittle's pianos took off 600 
miles from the Japanese main- 
land instead of 400 miles away 
as had been planned. As a re- 
sult, many of the planes ran 
out of gasoline before they 
reached China.

Japs Will Surrender 
In China September 6 

SAN FRANCISCO— Japanese

king on September 6, 

Gen. Ho Ying-Chin, com- 
mander of Chinese field forces,

Survivors of Famoos 
IJ- S. Sub Tang Re$>eiied 



ABOARD USS REEVES, OFF 
O M O R I — Comdr. Richard 
O'Kane, skipper of the famous 
Amorican submarine, Tang, and 
eight men of his crew were 
brought aboard U. S, mercy 
ships here yesterday after being 
rescued from the Omori prison 
camp. They disclosed the sub- 
marine Tang had been followed 
and sunk oft Formosa last Octo- 
ber, 

The Navy reported last Feb- 
ruary that the Tang was over- 
due and presumed lost. Pre- 
vioui^ly, the submarine had 
saved 22 naval aviators in a 
daring rescue off Truk, 



When a Japanese torpedo hit 
the submarine, O^Kane said, 
most of the crew was trapped 
and lost. Sux*v Ivors were 
picked up by Japanese destroy- 
er escort and landed on Formo- 
sa and transferred to Kyushu 
after several weeks. Thev 
were moved to Omori in April 

Survivors .said submarine 
prisoners were classified alon^ 
with aviators as "special pris^ 
n?'''T^;^..r''!' deprived of most 
of POW rights and received 
L^*^ ^'egular rations. Some 
of them were kept in solitary 
conftnement, they stated 



Prosecutor Annaeus 
Schodt said Quisling had been 
guilty of the "most far reaching 
and evil minded acts of treoson 
in Norwegian history." 

Schodt said evidence submit- 
ted showed that Quisling had 
collaborated with Germans be- 
fore and after the German in- 
vasion of Norway and had done 
nothing to prevent ill-ti^atment 
of Jews. 

Quisling frequently interrupt- 
ed Friday's proceedings to saj 
he had been ill-treated in jail 
by Norwegian police, but tht 
judge told him that the Nazis' 
prisoners were infinitely worse 
treated during the German oc- 
cupation.

Released prisoners said when 
anyone became sick at Omori 
camp, he was immediately giv- 
en only half the daily allow- 
ance of food. 

Daily rations were small 
quantities of grain and soup, 
Mo^t prisoner's stole food to 
keep alive^ They said most 
were forced to work outside the 
camp, carrying grain or work- 
ing in steel plants and rail 
yards, and often had to eat 
grass to get more nourishment. 

INS reporter Edgar Brown, 
aboard the mercy ship Heeves, 
said the battered, half-starved 
prisoners told numerous stories 
oi enemy brutality and sadism, 
and charged the Japanese with

after MacArthur wiis ordered to 
Australia, arrived here by air 
at MacArthur'K invitation to be 
present at the signing of Japan's

Wainwright expressed his

here Friday when Lieut« Gen. 
Jonathan M. Wainwright, for 
three and a half years a pris-

down witlj General of the 
Army Douglass MacArthur. 
The meeting took place in the 
private dining room of the New 
Grand Hotel, where General 
MacArthur and members of his 
staf! awaited General Wain- 
wright 's arrival. 

There was no ovation, Mac- 
Arthur just wrung Wainwright's 
hand and said simply: "Well, 
I'm glad to see you!" 

Wainwright, obviously in fine 
spirits after his recent visit to 
Manila, appeared to swallow 
momentarily before he an-

The folhioinq editorial is reprinted from yenter 
iliiifH ii^mw of ihf^ Nf^tc York Times: 

•MELBOURNE TO YOKOHAMA 
The new ruler of Japan does not claim to be descended 
from the Sods. Nor is he even theoretically absolute, for as 
fhe Supreme Allied Commander in the Pacific he h subject to 
several governments. As an American Army officer he is sub- 
ject to the War Department the President, Congress and the 
American people. But one judges that the qualities he has 
inhenled from his merely human ancestors will enable him to 
use his comp^rativoly limited authority In a manner satisfactory 
to his countrymen and to their Allies. 

Doug as MdcArthur has travelled as he says, "a long hard 
road." He has known what It is to experience utter defeat 
and it may have been more bitter for him to leave Corregidor 
under presidential orders than it was for General Wainwright 
to stay there with his troops. He knew what it was to face 
w T"' ^""^ sometimes vindictive criticism while he fretted 
'^^'f^.'^t''"^' planning his war and waiting for the chance 
with wh;ch to figh^ ;| Hg i^new what it was to send his men 
orward while means were still inadequate, long trail over hills 
from Port Moresby, savage struggles in New Guinea iungle. 
He commanded from Melbourne when that was most efficient 
way to got job done, and he commanded from the air and In 
dangerous landings when that became the most efficient way. 

As the occupation of Japan proceeds there is evident a 
pertect coordination of Army forces and a perfect coordination 
between the Army and Navy. Movements of the fleet Into 
Japanese waters, the assembly and dispatch of transport planes 
at Okinawa, the Vimit^q of every landing by sea and by air. all

"The secretive policy pursued 
(during the war) was such that 
it was not only the Japanese 
people but the whole world that 
had been kept in the dark as 
to the fighting strength of this 
country/' the editorial said, 

"If the truth were properly 
made public by the authorities, 
that alone would convince the 
people of the inevitability of the 
situation following its course as 
it did. 

^*An future efTorts* be it for 
the reconstruction of Japan 
or for building of permanent 
peace of tlic world, are but 
futile eflorts unless they stand 
on a basis of truth, upon a 
thorough knon ledge of truth, 
unclouded by propagrauda."

as a token of Army appreciation 
of the civilian contribution to 
victory. It will also be an op- 
portunity for local residents to 
renew acquaintances witli Enya 
Gonzalez, the Manilan soprano 
who is now on world toiu' under 
USO auspices. 

Among units participating 
are the 7th Fleet Service Force 
Band, entertainers and band 
from Far East Air Forces, 
38th Division Band and Show, 
the four Dukes of the 869th 
Engineer Aviation Battalion, 
and Jimmy Coe's 415th Army

Other civilian participation 
include the "Rhumbandidos" 
and the **Fiiipiniana" cast in a 
completely new group of native 
songs and dances. 



"I have reaa ii very careful- 
ly and I came to the conclusion 
that the whole thing is the re- 
suit of the policy which the 
country itself pursued. The 
country was not ready for pre- 
paredness. EveiT time the 
President made an effort to get 
a preparedness program through 
Congress, it was stifled. When- 
ever the President made a state- 
ment about the necessity of 
preparedness, he was vilified for 
doing it. I think the country 
is as much to blame as any in^ 
dividual In this final situation 
that developed in Pearl Har- 
I bor." 

Questioned regarding court 
martial proceedings against of- 
ficers blamed for the Pearl Har- 
bor debacle, Truman said he did 
not believe he had the power to 
histitute such order, adding 
that he knew of no reason why 
accused officers should not be 
given a chance to give their side 
of the case. 

Truman told correspondents 
that plans to help feed Europe 
this winter are being studied 
and worked on, that as soon 
as British representatives ar- 
rived in the S.^ he thought 
a plan satisfactory to all would 
be worked out.

ComVealth Revenue 
Totals f 2,000,000 

Revenue collections of the 
Commonwealth gos^ernment 
from February to June 3D 
amounted to P2,000,000, accord- 
ing to Budget Commissioner 
Ismael Mathay, 

The budget commissioner said 
the collections came up to the 
estimate of revenue for the pe-

tional revenue for the present 
year is P7,000,d00 while the 
proposed expenditures amount- 
ed to approximately P137,000.-

The cruiser Houston is the 
second warship of that name. 
The first was lost early in the 
war in the battle in Jyva sea. 

The two cruisers were part 
or the Third ^ Fleet which at- 
tacked Formosa airfields to 
neutralize Japanese air strength 
prior to the United States land^ 
ings in the Philippines. It was 
during this mission when they 
were iitruck by Japanese tor- 
pedo planes. 

The Houston took two tor^ 
pedo hits, one amidship and 
another in her stern. Canberra 
was put out of action by tor- 
pedo smashing into the boiler 
rooms. 

The Houston was towed out 
of the battle area by the cruiser 
Boston and emergency salvage 
measures kept her afloat. Later, 
the Pawnee took over the tow- 
ing and the Canberra also 
joined the Houston on the re- 
turn voyage. 

After ten days trip to Ulithi 
Atoll in Carolines, the Houston 
received emergency repairs. 
The next halt was at a floating 
drydock at Manus Island in 
the Admiralty Islands for tem- 
porary patches. Under her 
own power, the Houston pro- 
ceeded to Pearl Harbor, then on 
to New York. The Canberra 
made a similar trip to Boston. 



Free Entry For 
Food Into Manila 

In order to increase the food 
supply in Manila and to elimi- 
nate petty ijbuses on the part 
of law-enforcement authorities 
on the highways in connection 
with the transportation of food 
to the city, Col. H. Gilhouser, 
in charge of the Emergency 
Control Admininstrcition, issued 
iin order yesterday allowing the 
tree entry of food from the pro- 
v^inces. The order stated that 
hereafter, no permits of any 
kind shall be reciuired of pei-- 
'ous bringing food supplies into 
MLinil^i. 

In the case of food going to 
tht! provinces and elsewhere, 
permits are necessary before it 

;:an be moved out. Individuals 
desiring to take food out of 
Manila are required to secure 

1 permit to that effect fron^ the 
ECA. 

According to Gilhouser, the 
purpose of controlling the out- 
ward movement of food from 
Manila is to insure an adequate 
Cood supply in the city and at 
the same time to depress the 
current high prices. Goods 
moved from Manila without the 
necessury permit from the ECA 
will be commandeered and 
placed immediately under the 
custody of the ECA for dispo- 
sition. 

Cruiser Birmingham 
Survived 3 Big Hits 

WASHINGTON — The U. S. 
light cruiser Birmingham sur- 
vived three major battle dam- 
ages in the Pacific, including 
a torpedo attack and a pound- 
ing from a Jap kamika2e plane* 
the Navy Department disclosed 
yesterday. 

The Kamikaze crash off Oki- 
nawa last May 4 took the 
heaviest toll in the sick bay 
and officers* quarters* killing 
45 and wounding 80. Six more 
were reported missing. 

The Birmingham's two med- 
ical officers were killed as well 
as 19 of 24 of hospital corps 
members. 

On November 8, 1943, she was 
seriously damaged by a torpe- 
do.

necessary. He declined to pre- 
dict how long Allied occupation 
of Germany would last saying 
that this was a matter for high- 
er government policy, but added 
that Americans did not expect 
to stay here forever. 

Eisenhower said tlie biggest 
current task in Germany is sus- 
taining the nation with food, 
fuel and shelter this winter. He, 
further said that food, esipecial- 
ly canned meat, will have to be 
imported from the United 
States, 

Hegarding German coal pro^ 
duction, Eisenhower said it 
would be distributed among li- 
berated countries on priority 
basis with German needs being 
filled last. It is known that 
Holland, Belgium, France and 
Luxembourg have critical fuel 
problems. 



USO To Continue With 
Troop Entertainnnent 

NEW YORK The United

**for twelve monthii and possibly 
longer'^ in Alaska, Hawaii, Eu- 
rope, Paciac and areas adjacent 
to military hospitals and per- 
manent bases along the Atlan- 
tic seaboard. 

This was announced Wed- 
nesday by USO President Lind- 
slay F. Kimball who said that 
the ''end of the war with Japan 
can produce no quick changes 
in entertaining requirements in 
the European theater" because 
of the long period before all 
servicemen can return home.

Kelly's Hits On Harnna Told 



ABOARD MERCY SHIP 
REEVES* TOKYO BAY — 
Americans famed air ace, Capt. 
Colin Kelly, was not the "first 
suicide pilot" of this war, asj 
some leffcncls would have him 
l^but he was a ^reat hero just 
the same, accordini: to sur- 
viving^ fellow crewmen, res- 
cued from Japan's OiPorl 
prison camp yesterday. 

With tears in his eyes, Pfc. 
Robert Altman described 
Captain Kelly'.s last mission 
only two days *fter wars 
start. 



Altman was loading 500- 
tioimd bom lis onto Kelly 
B-17 at Clark Field when the 
Japanese attacked. The bomb- 
er took ofT with only three 
bombs aboard* 

"Captain Kelly made a run 
over the battleship* e?c|]eutltig 
to find a carrier nearby/^ 
Altman related. "Finainflr 
none« he returned to attack 
the battle waff on, later identi- 
fied as the Haruna. We drop- 
ped the three bombs, seoring 
one direct and two indirect 



lilts. The second bomb struck 
on the vessel's bridge. 

"Captain Kelly^s skill was 
magnificent in. maneuvering 
into position and attacking. 
Our navigator, Lieut. Joseph 
Bean, observed a black wake, 
and said that the ves^^el was 
burning from the bridge all 
the way back as we hit for 
our base." 

Wheii Kelly^s plane was 
five fniles from Clark Field, 
Altman related, two Japanese 
fighters attacked and set the 
bomber afire immediately. 



"Our plane blew up in less 
than one minute/' Altman 
said. "Captain Kelly never 
cleared the j^hip. The right 
side ifunner was also kilted, 
I bailed out with five others 
and reached iiur base unhurt/* 

Altman said he left Rataan 
several weeks after this tra- 
gedy» and operated a ground 
radio on Mindanao until sur- 
render brought his capture. 
The first time he heard Kel- 
ly pictured as a fiUicidc pilot 
w^H from lately arrived ptls™ 
oners in the Japanese camp.

aerial attacks with one gigantic 
airplane parts project estab-

At Gen- MacArthur's Head-

anese newspapermen reveuled 
yesterday- 

There was no indication how 
far along Japanese were in 
atomic research- Press dis- 
patches said reports of a Jap- 
anese atomic bomb were pub- 
lished in the Tokyo press in 
July. 

Japanese newsmen a!so re- 
vealed that a Japanese picket 
boat flashed the warning to 
Tokyo of the carrier force 
which brou^iht Lieut. Gen. 
James Doolittle^s raiders within 
range of Tokyo in April, 1942, 

The picket boat sighted tl^ 
carrier force 600 miles off the 
Japanese coast and managed to 
gel a warning to Japan before 
it was attacked and sunk by 
U. S- cruisers, 

The newsmen said some sur- 
vivors of the picket boat were 
picked up and subsequently de- 
corated by Emperor Hirohito. 
The picket boat was the direct 
cause of the large number of 
losses among Doolittle's flyers* 

Surmising that it had man- 
aged to flash a warning^ 
Doolittle's planes took of! 600 
miles from the Japanese main- 
land instead of 400 miles away 
as had been planned. As a re- 
sult, many of the planes ran 
out of gasoline before they 
reached China.

Japs Will Surrender 
In China September 6 

SAN FRANCISCO— Japanese 
Domei News Agency, quoting a 
Chinese news dispatch yester- 
day, said that the formal sur- 
render of Japanese forces in 
China would be signed in Nan^ 
king on September 

Gen. Ho Ying-Chm, com- 
mander of Chinese field forces, 
will represent Chma, while Gen. 
Yasuji Okamura, commander of 
Japanese forces in China, will

Domei also reported advance 
headquarters of the Chinese 
army had been established in 
Nanking under Gen. Leng 
Hsin, to "make preparations for 
taking over the city," with Chi- 
neso airborne forces scheduled 
to begin landing in the Nanking 
area today. 



*^ Public Prosecutor Annaeus 
Schodt said Quisling had been 
guilty of the "most far reaching 
and evil minded acts of treason 
in Norwegian history/' 

Schodt said evidence submit- 
ted showed that Quisling had 
collaborated with Germans be- 
fore and after the German in- 
vasion of Norway and had done 
nothing to prevent ill*treatment 
of Jews/ 

Quisling frequently interrupt- 
ed Friday's proceedings to saj 
he had been ill-treated in jail 
by Norwegian police^ but the 
judge told him that the Nazis^ 
prisoners were infinitely worse 
treated during the German oc- 
cupation. 



Survivors of Famous 
U. S. Sub Tang Resmietl 



ABOARD USS REEVES, OFF 
CM OR I — Comdr. Richard 
O'Kane, skipper of the famous 
American submarine, Tang, and 
eight men of his crew were 
brought aboard U. S. mercy 
ships hero yesterday after being 
rescued from the Omori prison 
camp. They disclosed the sub- 
niarine Tang had been followed 
and sunk off Formosa last Octo- 
ber, 

The Navy reported last Feb- 
ruary that the Tang was over- 
due and presumed lost. Pre- 
viously, the submarine had 
saved 22 nav^il avialrai^ m a 
daring rescue off Ti^k. 



When a Japanese torpedo hit 
the submarine, O'Kane said, 
most of the crew was trapped 
and lost. Survivors were 
picked up by Japanese destroy- 
er escort and landed on Formo- 
sa and transferred to Kyushu 
after several weeks. They 
were movod to Omori in April. 

Survivors said submarine 
prisoners were classified along 
witl:i aviators ns "special pris- 
oners,^^ were deprived of most 
of POW rights and received 
only half regular rations. Some 
oi: them were kept in solitary 
confmement, they stated.

signing the documents. The 
second pen he gave to Percival; 
the third was a navy issue pen; 
ilie fourth was presumably to 
be sent to President Truman, 
and the fifth was presunied to 
be retained by MacArthur. 

Fleet Admiral Chester W. 
Nimitz was the next signatory, 
signing on behalf of the United 
States. After Nimitz, represea 
tatives of Great Britain, the 
Soviet Union, Australia, Cara- 
cia, France, the Netherlands and 
New Zealand signed, in that 
order. 

Immediately after Shigemiisu 
had signed the documents, Mac- 
Arthur handed him "Gf^neral 
Orders Number One." The two 
surrender documents were 
identical, one in English and 
the other in Japanese. The 
document in English was bound 
in gold and the Japanese docu-

Planes Told Tokyo 
"No Surrender!" 

TOKYO — Press dis- 
patches said that after 
Emperor Hirohito had told 
the Japanese people the 
war was over, several 
planes dropped pamphlets 
for two days on Japanese 
cities asking the people to 
disregard the Emperor's 
word and fight on. 

The planes were evident- 
ly flov.Ti by suicide pilots, 
according to one Tokyo re- 
sident. He said the ma- 
jorUv of Japanese were 
Shocked by the thought ^^^^ 
-iic#^iipvinff the Emperor, 
J^d^^ 

died quickly for lack or 
popular support^ 



Arthur told the Japanese that 
"as Supreme Commander for 
the Allied Powers, I announce 
it is my firm purpose, in the 
tradition of the countries I re- 
present, to proceed in the dis- 
charge of my responsibilities 
with justice and tolerance, while 
taking all necessary dispositions 
to insure that the terms of sur- 
render are fully, promptly and 
faithfully complied with." 

President Truman, in a broad- 
cast yesterday, immediately fol- 
lowing the surrender ceremo- 
nies, emphasized the cost of 
victory and what it will mean: 
For the United States, the 
President said, V-J Day is a 
day for "renewed consecration 
to principles which have made 
us the strongest nation on the 
earth" and a day to "move to- 
ward a new era of security at 
home." For Japan — an end of 
"povv'er to destroy." 

For the world — a new era "of 
peace and international good 
will and cooperation." 

MacArthur, in a similar vein, 
voiced the hope that "from this 
solemn occasion a better world 
shall emerge out of the blood and 
carnage of the past — a world 
founded upon faith and under- 
standing — a world dedicated to 
the dignity of man and the ful- 
fillment of his most cherished 
wish — for freedom, tolerance 
and justice." 

Nimitz paid tribute to the Al- 
lies, saying: 

United we fought and unit- 
ed >ve prevail." 

The signatories of the sur- 
render documents include: for 
Japan — Shigemitsu, on behalf of 
Emperor Hirohito and the Jap- 
anese government, and Gen. 
Umezu for the Japanese Impe- 
rial headquarters; Gen. Mac

Yamashita Gives Up; 
Peace in Philippines 

Japan's greatest field general of this war, Lieut.

The surrender ceremony will 
take place in a mahogany-

Yamashita will surrender to

the "Little Imperial Palace,'" 
because it vv'as the headquarter* 
of the Japanese militai-y com-

Last December, in an attempt 
to bolster Philippine confidence 
in Jap victory, Yamashita said: 

"I want to assure you one and 
all that my mission of defend- 
ing the sovereignty and terri- 
torial integrity of this county' 
will be fulfilled even at the 
sacrifice of my life."

MISSION COMPLETED 

With +hG signing of the Instrument of Surrender by Japan, 
and President Truman's official declaration of V-J Day as of 
yesterday. The MANILA FREE PHILIPPINES bow$ out of exist- 
ence with its task conrtpleted* 

When it was initially published on February 9, while fight- 
ing still raged throughout the city. The MANILA FREE PHILIP^ 
PINES was established as a temporary expedient to supply news 
and information ur»t!l privately printed newspapers with suffi- 
cient resources could perform these functions* But, as stated 
previously in this column, the almost complete destruction of 
printing facilities in the city, coupled with the acute shortage 
of newsprint, made It Impossible for the great pre-war Manila 
newspapers to begin publication on a scale commensurate with 
tfie needs of the city. 

The MANILA FREE PHILIPPINES has been published by the 
United Stales Office of War Information, under the direct con- 
trol and censorship of the military authorities. Its one aim has 
been to provide the people of Manila with news and Informa- 
tion — weapons of democracy they had so greatly needed for so 
long. And as has been editorially noted before, this publica- 
tion would go out of business as soon as Its need had passed. , 

Thusi with the removal of General MacArThur's Headquar- 
ters to Tokyo where he has already taken over complete control 
of Japan as Supreme Allied Commander, and the official V-J 
declaration, The MANILA FREE PHILIPPINES, as a Manila 
metropolitan daily, marks its mission completed. 

In its place there will appear shortly a tabloid airmail edi- 
tion of The FREE PHILIPPINES, to be published semi-weekly 
particularly for the people of the Philippine provinces. 

During Its short but eventful history as a daily. The MANILA 
FREE PHILIPPINES believes it has contributed to the task of 
bridging the gap between the city's wanton destruction and its 
nnergetic reconstruction. 

To the brave citizens of Manila who have turned to the gi- 
gantic tasks of rehabilitation with such unstinted courage and 
fresh vigor, despite the tremendous obstacles to be overcome, 
we say: 

^"GOODBYE, &00D LUCK— AN D MABUHAY!" 
Peace!

Background Story On 
The **Free Philippines^^ 

With the coming of V-J Day, the editorial curtain 
on The Free Philippines as a daily Manila publicatioir 
r HL's down, to be shortly replaced by an airborne tabloid 
Pdition especially printed for the Philippine provinces 
The reaching of this milestone which brings to a close 
a newspaper career unique in the annals of Philippine 
Journalism, disclosed some interesting facts regardiiiif 
the -hurt but eventful history of the Manila Free Phil, 
ippin ..y, which are worthy of review at this time. 

On the morning of February 
9, six days after the first Ameri- 
can troops had entered Manila, 
the Manila Free Philippines was 
distributed to the people of the 
city, v^hose only regular news- 
paper fare for the past three 
years had been the lies of the 
Japanese propagandists. 

That original small group of 
OWI newsmen was headed by 
Frederic Marquardt, SWPA 
chief of the U. S. omce of War 
intormation and former asso- 
ciate editor of the Philippines 
Free Prejss, who assumed exe- 
cutive direction of the paper. 

During its entirety, The Ma- 
nila Free Philippines has been 
published by the OWI unit, at- 
LacJicd to GHQ's Psychological 
Warfare Branch, lieaded by 
Brig. Gen, Bonner Fellers, with 
Lt- Col. Woorlall Greene, as ex- 
ecutive officer, assisted by Lt, 
Co], Claude Hawley. 

Ed Paxton, a newspaper edit- 
or from Paducah, Kentucky, 
and a veteran of the Leyte 
campaign, became the first 
editor, a post he retained until 
late in March when he returned 

to the States* 

He was replaced for a short 
time by Willard Hess» a news- 
paperman from Huntington, 
W. v., who was forced to return 
to the U. S. within a few weeks 
due to illness. 




The editorship was then taken 
over, early in April, by Se:t. 
Joseph Paul, a former OWI 
tiowH nditor in San Francisco, 
who had conic in with Mac- 
Arthur's initial invasion to help 
write tho "Voice of Frcjcdom" 
ri\dio bioadcasts as well as the 
Leyte-Sanuir Froe Philippines 
ustablishfd at Tacloban, and 
which t'ontinued publication 
until thfj middle of March, 

With Paul's assignment to a 
newswriting: post with the 
occupational forces in Jap 
an several weeks ago, the edit- 
orship was taken over by Dick 
Watkins, a former San Francis 
CO newspaperman who had pre 
viously served as a news editor 
m Sydney and Brisbane, Aus- 
tralia, and during the earlv 
days at Leyte. 

Throughout most of this pe 
riod, the supervision of the 
pruitmg and mechanical de- 
partment of the paper has been 
in the hands of Frank G. Eager 
of Brisbane, Australia, who also 
^mwed m a similar capacity on 
ine Leyte-Samar Free Philio- 
pines. ^ 

Other iiersonnel who have 
narticiputed as rewriters or 
editors of the paper 
since its uiception include Ed 
Hughes, former New York 
new^si^aperman; Hamilton Peck, 

nviffith, of Chieaao, IIL. and 
Gporire Botts, of Warren, Pa, 
The city **beats" and report- 

aV'U 1 ^^^^ ^^^^ headed by 
Al Valencia, a well-known for- 



mer reporter for the Manila 
Bulletin, accredited to Mac- 
Arthur's headquarters as a war 
correspondent at the outbreak 
of the war in 1941. 

Others on the "local" staff 
were Filemon V. Tutay, photo^ 
grapher-reporter; Dioscoro L 
Francisco, Leon O. Ty and Lu- 
ciano Millan, all veteran Mani- 
la newsmen. 

During most of its existence, 
the paper was printed at the 
Carmelo and Bauerm^nn plant, 
under the supervision of Ramon 
Ordoveza, assisted by Tii'so 
ObispOj foreman* 

Much of the credit for the 
paper hitting*- its "dt^adline" with 
factual worldwide news^ goes to 
the Manila radio monitoring 
section of OWI beaded by 
Stephen Johnson and Oley Sum- 
merf ield, both veteran radiomen 
of the Leyte and Luzon caiii- 
pail^ns. Aiding them in mai?;- 
taining a 24-hour radio news 
n^onitorinj^^ service which sup- 
plied The Free Philippines 
with daily ^^fressh copy^* from 
San Francisco shortwave sta- 
tionSj were two other hmi\ 
veterans, Leonard Danaher and 
Fred Tiedko- 

The art and photo sections 
have been capably handled 
throughout, by George Adams, 
Gene Schnell, Karl Bachmeyer 
and Bill Java, 

Others too numerous to men- 
tion have also served their 
**time" in helping to see that 
The Pi-eo Philippines *1iit the 
streets'' despite numerous han- 
dicapij. Somehow, the paper 
always managed to come out, 
although on some days the press 
run might be almost 50,000 
copies while on others, if press 
trouble developed after the bat- 
tering the Japs have previously 
given the mechanical equip- 
ment, 20,000 copies were lucky 
to be printed* 

Originally limited only to 
Manila, the Manila Free Phil- 
ippines, in recent months, be- 
came the most widely distribut- 
ed newspaper in the Philippines, 
being circulated without charge^ 
in cities, towns and barrios in 
the entire archipelago, froiji 
Aparri to Zaraboanga, ^vith 
Ji early 500,000 people estimated 
to have read it daily during it^ 
peak period, 

Credit for this wide distrio^^- 
tion goes largely to Hal Liii^|j 
who was former advertisin& 
manager for the Manila Bul- 
letin, and his Filipino assistant* 
Frank Zaldariaga. 

With this issue, the Manil^^

with its entire staff feeling the/

and unbiased news so essentia , 
to the democratic way of lif^ /

CRAFTSMEpHfOR VICTORY: 




ADMIRAL VyiLLlAM F. HALSEY 



GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR 



I>„ „^ 

ADMIRAL CHESTER W. NIMITZ 



OCCUPATION DUTY NOT NEW FOR MacARTHUR 

WASHINGTON Occupation duty is not new to General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, the man who has been appointed 
Supreme Allied Commander for occupation of Japan. After the first world war, he served with the Army of Occupation in Germany. 
He knows the Japanese, and by all accounts they respect and fear him. Learning about Japan ever since his tour of that country 
shortly after his graduation from West Point, he has been gathering more knowledge constantly since his return to the Philippines 
where his military career has centered. 



Over six feet tall, wide 
shouldered, qualified judges 
Rave praised him as a genius 
of strategy and his officers 
are fiercely loyal. 

MacArthur had been com- 
manding general of American 
Army forces in the Pacific 
since April 5, 1945, sharing 
overall assignment of defeat- 
ing Japan with Fleet Admiral 
Chester W, Nimitz, who heads 
all sea forces in that ocean. 

General MacArthur took 
part in the Vera Cruz expedi- 
tion of 1914 and served 
through the first world war 
in the Rainbow Division with 
an excellent record. He had 
been fighting in World War 
II since the first Japanese 
strike at Manila. 

His military career has 
been spectacular throughout. 
His scholastic marks at West 



Point still top Academy 
records. He was the young- 
est division commander of 
the first world war, the 
youngest superintendent West 
Point ever had, and youngest 
man ever to be chief of staff 
of the United States Army. 

After his tour as chief of 
staff from 1930 to 1935, he 
went back to the Philippines 
as director of Commonwealth 
defense and still held that 
post when Japanese struck in 
December, 1941. He retired 
from the United States Army 



in 1937 but went back into 
active duty in July, 1941, be- 
fore the Japanese invasion. 

Just before the fall of 
Bataan, General MacArthur 
was ordered out to Australia 
for a job just being finished 
— march back to Tokyo. The 
story goes that he didn't want 
to go but preferred to stay in 
the Philippines and fight a 
guerrilla war while waiting 
for American relief. 

In face of opposition both 
in the Philippines and in the 
United States, General Mac- 



Arthur, as Field Marshal of 
the Philippine Army, dogged- 
ly and quietly went ahead to 
build up the Filipino forces 
which were later to distin- 
guish themselves at Bataan 
and Corregidor. 

The late President Quezon, 
inspired by MacArthur, rec- 
ommended and obtained ap- 
proval from the Philippine 
Legislature of large amounts 
of Philippine government 
funds for the Philippine 
Army, while detractors of the 
MacArthur - Quezon army 





program argued against it. 
The inspirational record of 
the Philippine Army in the 
battle of the Philippines 
showed the far-sightedness of 
the two leaders. 

The pattern of MacArthur's 
drive back up the Pacific was 
set in the spring of 1942. The 
Australians had their plans 
all laid for defense against 
the Japanese invaders within 
their own homeland. Mac- 
Arthur met strong opposition 
but won his point. He met 
the enemy in New Guinea and 
beat him. He has been go- 
ing the same way ever since. 

Douglas MacArthur was 
born in an army camp near 
Little Rock, Arkansas, Jan- 
uary 26, 1880, the son of 
Lieut. Gen. Arthur Mac- 
Arthur, who distinguished 
himself in the Philippines in 
the war with Spain.

WE SHALL NOT FORGET PEARL HARBOR 




WASHINGTON — Speaking 
yesterday from the Whitc> 
House over a radk? hookup 
linked with the battleship USS 
Missouri on which the Japanei^ 
had previously signed the sur- 
render in Tokyo Bay, President 
Truman told his "fellow Ameri- 
cans'' that he was proclaiming 
September 2 as "V-J Day— the 
day of formal surrender by 
Japan." 

After listening to a radio des- 
cription of the surrender cere- 
mony b roadcast from USS Mi s- 



Kouri, tho Primal dent delivered a 
10-minute addresg. 

He was followed on the pro- 
gram by the Supreme Allied 
Commander^ General of the 
Arrny Douglas MacArthur and 
Admiral of the Fleet Chester W. 
Nimity., speaking from aboard 
the battle&hip in Tokyo Bay. 

President Truman said, **We 
shall not forget Pearl Harbor" 
and added, 'Japanese militarists 
will not forget the USS Mis- 
souri." 

"The evil done by Japanese 
warlords can never he repaired

nuedj *'but their power to de^ 
stroy and kill has been taken 
from them, and ihmr arinies 
and what is left of their navy 
are now impotent/' 

The President said formal 
Japanese surrender is victory 
of more than arms alone, "This 
is victory of liberty over ty- 
ranny," he declared.

who died in war and to those 
who contributed to AUied vic-

MacArthur's 
Proclamation 

ON BOARD U.S.S. MIS- 
SOURI, TOKYO BAY — 
Partial text of concluding 
address of General Mac- 
Arthur, Supreme Allied 
( ommander, following the 
formal Japanese surrender; 

"Today the guns are si- 
lent. A great tragedy has 
ended. A great victory has 
been won. The skies no 
lonRer rain death— the seas 
l)ear only commerce — men 
everywhere walk upright in 
the sunlight. The entire 
world is quietly at peace. 
The holy mission has been 
completed and in reporting 
this to you, the people, I 
speak for the thousand of 
silent lips, forever stilled 
among the jungles and the 
beaches and in the deep 
waters of the Pacific which 
marked the wa/. I speak 
for the unnamed brave mil- 
lions homeward bound to 
take up the challenge of 
that future which they did 
so much to salvage from 
the brink of disaster. 

'*As I look back on the long 
tortuous trial from those pirn 
days of Bataan and Corregidor. 
when an entiio world li%^ed in 
fear; when democracy was on 
the dofensivt* evorj^vhero, when 
modem civilization trembled in 
the balance, I thank a merciful 
God that he has given us the 
faith, tht? courai^c and the power 
from which to mould victory, 

"We ha%^c known the hitter- 
ness of defeat and the exult fU ion 
of triumph^ and from both we 
have learned there cnn be no 
tui ning back. We must go for- 
v^uird to preserve in peace what 
we won in war. 

"Men ^'inca tht^ beginning of 
time have >50U|iht peace. Various 
methods througrh the ajres have 
attempted to devise an Interna- 
tinnal procesii to prevent ur j^et- 
tle disputes between nntion* 
From tlip very 8tari, worknhie 
methods were found insofur as 
individual citizens were con- 
cerned but the ntechiinitTS of an 
instrumentality of larger inter- 
national scope have never been 
succesi?fnU Military alliance, 
balances of power, leagues of 
nations, all in turn failed, leav- 
ing the only path to be by way 
of the crucible of war. The ni- 
ter destructiveness of war now 
blots out this alternative. We 
hnvo had our last chance. If 



Wainwright Broadcasts 
Gratitude To U..S. People 

TOKYO— In the first broadcast over Tokyo Radio 
bv a high rankinir American official since beforG the 
War, Lt. Gen. Jonathan M. Wainwright expressed his 
gratitude to the American people for their understand- 
ing of his surrender in 1942-<«' 

Broadcasting to America, 
General Wainwright explained 
his early attempt after his re- 
lease from captivity in Manchu- 
ria to address the American 
public from Chungking taut that 
atmospheric conditions prevent- 
ed reception. Wainwright stated 
he had desired to explain "my 
dire misfortune when I had, by 
circumstances beyond my con- 
trol, to surrender" at Corregi- 
dor. He said the belief that the 
American people appreciated 
the diUlculties of defeat at Cor- 
regidor has "sustained and com- 
forted*' him during his years of 
Japanese imprisonment. 

Wainwright said in part: 

"After living for more than 
three years in captivity in Jap- 
anese campsp I am again leading 
the life of a free man, American 
soldier and citizen. I flew from 
Mukden, Manchuria, on August 
27th to Hsian, then to Chung- 
king the following day and rest- 
ed for a day while we were re- 
equipped. On August 30, 1 fiew 
from Chungking to Manila ac* 
companied by General Beebe^ 
my chief of st.iff; Colonel Pew 
and Lt. Col, Dooley, my aides; 
and Master Sergeant Carroll, 
my orderly. These are the only 
living Americans who were with 
nie on that dark day when I 
met Japanese General Homma 
at Camp No. 7 on Bataan. 

"After the ceremony, I am re- 
turning to Manila for two or 
lliree days and thereafter I ex- 
rect to fly to the United States/^ 



we do not now devise some great- 
er and more equitable system, a 
Arnvagcddon will be at our door. 
The problem basically is thGolo- 
gical imd involves a spiritual re- 
ci udosence and improvement of 
human character that will svn- 
chronizewith advance in j^cit^nce, 
art, literature aiul all material 
and cultural developments of 
the past tw^o thousand years. It 
must be of the spirit if we aro 
to save the flesh, 

"In the Philippines, America 
has evolved a new model for 
this new free world in Asia, In 
the Philippines, America 
dt^monstrated that peoplus of the 
east and peoples of tlie west 
may walk side by side in mutual 
respect and with mutual benefit. 
The history of our sovm^eignty 
there, has now the full eon- 
fidoncc of the east." 



Allied Forces 
Enter Hongkortg 

HONGKONG — British, Cana- 
dian and Australian warships 
landed Royal Marines at Hong- 
kong yesterday to clear the 
dockyard area and take over 
the control tower. 

First forces^ went ashore from 
the British cruisers Swiftsure 
and Euryalus and raised the 
white ensign. More would be 
landed from the British battle- 
ship Anson and the Canadian 
anti-aircraft cruiser Prince 
Robert, press dispatches rep* 
orted. 

Rear Admiral Cecil Harcourt 
ordered the Japanese command- 
er at Hongkong to send a dele- 
gation out to his flagship at once 
to arrange for surrender, an 
earlier dispatch reported. 



Dutch Indies May 
Be Liberated Last 

SYDNEY — The Netherlands 
East Indies probably will be the 
last important territory over- 
run -by the Japanese to be re* 
covered by the Allies, it was 
reported here yesterday. No 
definite announcement by 
Netherlands officials or Admiral 
Lord Louis Mountbatten has 
been made on the time when 
the Allies will enter Java, but 
press reports stated it w^as not 
likely that its occupation would 
take place until Singapore was 
reoccupied. 

Mitchell bombers have been 
dropping foodj radios and read- 
ing matter into 25 Indies prison 
camps, while Lt. Gov, H. J. Van 
Mook has broadcast from Ausr- 
tralia telling Japanese forces to 
maintain order until the Allies 
arrive, other dispatches repoit- 
ed. 

In the Indies there are be* 
lieved to be 20,000 Netherlands 
prisoners and 20,000 others of 
various nationalities. 



Chinese Airborne 
Land At Shanghai 

SHANGHAI— Large airborne 
units of the Chinese Sixth 
Army, directed by American 
officers, have landed at Shang- 
hai to pave the way for a larger 
number of troops to follow, 
press dispatches reported yes- 
terday. 

The reports said Chinnoc 
air officers arrived by plane to 
investigate landing facilities for 
troops* 

Whenever Chinese inhabitants 
see Allied planes, they "go wild 
\vaving Hags and handkerchiefs 
and exploding fire-crackers^" 
the dispatch added. 

Meanwhile, Chungking Radio 
reported 100 planes would take 
an estimated 3,000 Chinese 
troops to Shanghai and Nanking 
daily beginning today. 



Military Academy 
Re 'Opening Urged 

Secretary of National Defense 
Alfredo Montelibano yesterday 
stressed the need for the re- 
opening of the Philippine Milit^ 
ary Academy to fill the short- 
ago of officers required for a 
contemplated standing army of 
40,000 men. 

He revealed that at present 
there are only 700 x^egular of^ 
fleers available for such a stand- 
ing force which normally 
should have 2,170* The short- 
age of 1,470 officers, according 
to Montelibano, is being filled 
in the interim by reserve and 
guerrilla officers. 

It was reported that a bill will 
soon be presented in the Phil- 
ippine Congress seeking the re- 
opening o£ the academy, to 
provide for a cadet corps of 
2,000 which is much greater 
thnn the pre-war corps of only 
350. 

The Philippine Army Com- 
mand, according to Secretary 
Montelibano, believes that^ a 
cadet corps of 2,000 is too big 
and that one of 1,000 which will 
graduate from 180 to 250 of- 
ficers a year would be sufficient.
