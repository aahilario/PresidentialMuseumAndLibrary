The Honorable , 

The Secretary of national* Defense and Coromuni cat ions 
Tacloban, Leyte 

S i r t 


After verification has been made, I found out that the 
followings post-offices also ixi need of canceling post- 
marking (Dispatching) and receiving postmarking staixps in 
addition to Tacloban as per our requisition dated I-oveiaber • 
26, 1944 j 

Tanauan, Leyte, Philippines 
Dulag, Leyte, Piiilippines 
Burauen, Leyte, Philippines 
Dagami , Leyte, Philippines 
Abuyog, Leyte, Philippines 
• Alangralang, Leyte, Philippines 
Carigara, Leyte, Philippines 
Barugo, Leyte, Philippines 
■Baybay, Leyte, Philippines 
9 Orncc , Leyte, P’hilippines 

Capoocnn, Lej''te, Philippines 
Pastrana, Leyte, Philippines 
Ban lliguel, Leyte, Philippines 


All of the above post-offices nave either been looted 
or destroyed by fire; hence their supplies and records in- 
cluding postnarking stamps are now xoissing. 

r 

In view of this, I e/arnestl;,^equest that requisition 
be made to supply them v/ith the necessary postnarking .stamps . 
preferably steel, but if ste^ is not available, rubber 
stamps v/ith complete dates nay be utili^d. for-^the purpose. 

Very respectfully,
