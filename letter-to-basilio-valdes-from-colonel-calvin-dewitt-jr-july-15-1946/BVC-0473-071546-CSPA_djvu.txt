Dear General Valdes: 

Receipt of your letters of June 18th and June 27 th is 
acknowledged. I am very happy to hear that your voyage turned 
out to be a pleasant one and that you were well looked after 
during your trip on the USAT "REPUBLIC" . 

I am particularly pleased to hear of the efficient work 
and courtesies on the part of the transport personnel which you 
named in your two letters. You can rest assured that your commenda- 
tions and words of appreciation will be transmitted to each of 
them, 

I hope that too many days will not pass before you will be 
able to visit the United States again. 

With kindest personal regards. 

Sincerely yours,
