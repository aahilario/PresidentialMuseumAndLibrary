My dear 'A1‘. 



* My presence here in Germany makes it impoLiSible to 
present to you personally, as I would like.to, the hearer of 
letter, my good and personal friend, Captain and Doctor V.J. Valdes 
of Minila, 

Caotain Valdes has been doing 'overseas service for 
the. oast two years, the last six months, of which being connected 
with* the German Commission, with wh.ich I am also associated. 

T^Totwithstandirig the fact that the captain is an 
American thru and thru it is his first visit to the States , and 
I would*' consider it a personal favor, if you would personally or 
thru your Military Secty. help him in any way you oossibly can. 

I- hope the Republican Legislature of 1919 did not 
oass you too many "buc'tcs" but knowing as I do the general makeup 
of the two houses and yourself am confident that those "bucks" 
were returned in due and corrected form. 

With kindest Regards for both yourself and family 
permit me to be - - 



His Excellency, Alfred E.Sitith 
Governor of H.Y. State, 

Albany - iT.Y.
