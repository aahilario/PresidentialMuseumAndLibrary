Biographical Sketch of 
President Manuel L. Quezon 



MkM 



The career of Manuel Luis Que- 
zon, President of the Philippine 
Commonwealth, has closely paral- 
leled the advance of the Philippines 
toward national identity. A self- 
made man, he has risen to his pres- 
ent position of leadership as the re- 
sult of his determination to guide 
his country to its rightful place in 
the world. 

President Quezon came from a 
modest family in the town of Baler, 
Tayabas Province, in Luzon. He 
was educated at the College of San 
Juan de Letran and the University 
of Santo Tom as, Manila. He re- 
ceived a degree of bachelor of laws 
at the latter* Subsequent study was 
interrupted by the Filipino revolt 
against Spain, the American occu- 
pation of the Islands, and the in- 
surrection against the United States. 
Mr. Quezon rose to the rank of 
major in the war against the United 




Manuel L. Quezon, at the time he was 
Philippine Resident Commissioner at 
Washington, D. C 

States, and was one of the last Fili- 
pino officers to take an oath of al- 
legiance to the United States. 

After the war, Mr. Quezon's abili- 
ty as a political leader began to 
emerge. His first post was as pro- 
vincial fiscal (district attorney) in 
Mindoro. Soon afterward he was 
elected governor of his native prov- 
ince, Tayabas, and then was chosen 
as the first representative of that 
province in the newly-established 
Philippine Assembly. 



Representative Quezon rapidly 
made a name for himself as a pro- 
ponent of Philippine independence. 
During his last year and a half in 
the Assembly he was floor leader. 
His legislative duties were interrupt- 
ed in 1909 by his election as Resident 
Commissioner of the Philippines in 
the United States. 

For seven years, Mr, Quezon 
served in the American capital, cam- 
paigning ceaselessly for indepen- 
dence. His greatest achievement 
was the passage of the Jones Law of 
1916, giving substantial autonomy 
in local affairs to the Filipinos and 
promising the Islands complete in- 
dependence as soon as a stable 
government has been established. 

Upon his return to the Philippines 
in 1916, Mr. Quezon was elected 
President of the Senate, a position 
which he continued to hold up to 
the day the Philippine Common- 
wealth was inaugurated in 1935, 
During that period, the Filipinos 
made steady progress toward their 
goal of independence, In 1934 the 
Tydings-McDuffie Law (the Philip- 
pine Independence Act) was passed 
by Congress, providing for the es- 
tablishment of a Philippine Republic 
in 1946, following a 10-year period 
under the Commonwealth Govern- 
ment. 

In the first Commonwealth elec- 
tions, held in 1935 in preparation 
for the inauguration of the Com- 
monwealth Government on Novem-* 
ber 15, 1935, the Filipino people 
elected Manuel L. Quezon president 
by an overwhelming majority, with 
Sergio Osmena as vice-president. He 
and Mr. Osmena were reelected — * 
again overwhelmingly — on Novem- 
ber 11, 1941. 

Since his inauguration in 193 5, 
President Quezon has had to face 
many pressing problems created by 
the establishment of the Common- 
wealth Government. At that time, 
the gathering clouds of war already 
cast their shadow over the Philip- 
pines. Indeed, the President's first 
act was to secure the passage of the 
National Defense Act. This Act 
provided for the creation of a citi- 
zen's army which was to be expanded 
over a period of years, so that 
eventually the Philippines could de- 
fend itself against any aggressor. 
Only a small portion of this Army 
consisted of regulars; the majority 
of the troops were trained reservists, 



With President Roosevelt's consent* 
President Quezon invited General 
Douglas Mac Arthur to undertake 
the task of building a strong military 
establishment in the Philippines. It 
was while this work was in progress 
that the Japanese struck in Decem- 
ber, 1941. 

The second major task of the 
Quezon administration was in the 
field of social problems. The earlier 
Philippine labor legislation, com- 
pletely inadequate for the needs of 
a rapidly developing state, was over- 
hauled and replaced with progres- 
sive legislation. The general Stand- 




President Quezon in the nnitorm of a 
Lcgioiiarif>> the Fraternal Order t>f which 
he is the Honorary President, 

ard of living in the Philippines, until 
the Japanese occupation, had be- 
come virtually the highest in the 
Far East. Similarly^ the President 
did much to better the lot of the 
agrarian population of the Com- 
monwealth.

MAN-MAKING 

We are all blind until we see 
That, in the human plan, 

Nothing is worth the making if 
It does not mate the man. 



By Edwin Marlcham 

Why build these cities glorious 
If man unbuilded goes? 

In vain we build the world unless 
The builder also grows. 



MANUEL L. QUEZON - 

The leadership of Manuel L. Quezon is unique 
in the annals of modern history. Very few men 
have ascended the heights and remained at the 
top for as long as Quezon has. 

Since the year that he became governor of 
Tayabas, his province, served at Washington as 
Philippine Resident Commissioner to the United 
States, returned to the Islands to run for Senator 
in the newly-created bicameral Legislature, as 
provided in the Jones Law of 1916, and simul- 
taneously elected President of the Senate by his 
constituents, Mr. Quezon had never been — was 
never allowed by the people to be— out of the 
political scene. He had been President of the 
Senate since its inception till 1935 when the 
Legislature was supplanted by the unicameral 
National Assembly- Quezon was overwhelm- 
ingly elected President of the Commonwealth 
of the Philippines established by the Tydings- 
McDuffie Law of 1934. 

Obviously, the Filipino people wanted Quezon, 
The Filipinos know a real leader when they see 
one. In Quezon they saw — as they see now — 
the sterling qualities of a truly great leader. In 
Manuel L, Quezon's entire political career he 
had never lost an election. In Manuel L. Que- 
zon's entire political career he had never swerved 
from the goal he had set his heart and mind to 
accomplish: Philippine Independence, Since the 
time he had sworn allegiance to the United States 
of America he had never faltered in that loyalty, 
even insisting to fight, at his late age, side by side 
with the Filipino-American soldiers in the Philip- 
pines, dissuaded only by General Douglas Mac- 
Arthur, who reminded him that as long as the 
head of a government is not captured by the 
enemy that government still exists, 

A real leader is proven also by his sound judg- 
ment in selecting logical men to work with him. 



An Ideal Filipino Leader 

It was Quezon who invited General Mac Art hut- 
to serve in the Philippines as Field Marshal. 
Mae Arthur gained the confidence and love of 
the Filipino people. The fruit of Quezon's judg^ 
ment was the complete reversal of Japan's plan 
to invade and control the entire Philippines by 
January 1, 1942. Six months resistance by the 
Filipino -American forces gave us here in America 
ample time to prepare; the same with Australia 
and other Allies of ours in the South Pacific. 

Another very wise selection by Quezon was 
that of Joaquin M. Elizalde, for the office of Phil- 
ippine Resident Commissioner at Washington, 
Elizalde has been efficacious in the discharge of his 
duties. He has been recouping the prestige of 
the office lost during the administration of Quin- 
tin Pa redes. The selection of General Basilio 
Valdez and Col. Andres Soriano is another credit 
to Quezon. 

President Quezon's official stay at Washington 
has been most beneficial to the Philippine Gov- 
ernment in exile. The Philippines is a signatory 
to the Atlantic Charter and President Quezon 
is a member of President Roosevelt's Pacific War 
Cabinet- 

As his birthday approaches, President Quezon 
is reported confined in bed. The Filipino people 
pray for his immediate recovery. The Philip- 
pines is fortunate to have a leader like Quezon- 
America is fortunate to have a friend like Que- 
zon. The Filipinos repeat Josiah Gilbert Hol- 
land's supplication: "God give us men! A time 
like this demands strong minds, great hearts, 
true faith and ready hands". 

For all these things, The Philippine- American 
OBSERVER rejoices that Manuel L- Quezon has 
reached another milestone. God bless President 
Quezon! And God bless America — the America 
that Manuel L. Quezon loves — and the America 
that the Filipinos love!

MANILA 



(Written by A. DALE RILEY long be- 
fore the Japanese sneak attack) 

Manila, you're an Eastern town, 
And yet a very Western town; 
Sometimes you seem a Northern town,, 
And yet you're in the South; 
There's such a great variety 
Of buildings and society, 
Of nothing is there drought. 

A true Pearl of the Orient — 
None like you in the Occident — 
Your satin sheen from Heaven sent, 
Reflects the rising sun: 
And still it is through clanging nights 
Of Lim Kai Tong and Ongpin sights. 
Of shuffling feet round fitful lights, 
You and the East are one. 

Yet in the business thoroughfares, 
Where merchants sell their Western 
wares, 

Your signs reflect electric glares 
Proclaiming what is "best": 
Your boulevards the auto horn 
Incessant wakes from night till morn, 
The carromatas slow to warn, 
Of progress from the West. 

A Northern town you seem to me 
When winds blow across the sea, 
And torrents swirl terrifically 
Through many a guttered street: 
For then to clubs American, 
Or hotels cosmopolitan, 
I go to see my countrymen 
Speed Time on flying feet. 

Yet in your gardens with the rose 
The fragrant sampaguita grows, 
And as your name, Maynilad shows, 
Neath many a Southland tree 
The native shrubbery in bloom 
Fills your bright air with faint perfume 
As night is filled with the round moon 
Across the tropic sea. 

Confined no more within your walls, 
Your boundaries of cloistered halls, 
Where many a mossy tower recalls 
Romantic Spanish clays. 
You've grown from native village small, 
Through Spanish town of bastioned wall, 
Into a modern city tall, 
With modern city ways, 

Manila, you're a Malay town, 
And still you are a Spanish town, 
And now so much American 
It is not hard to tell, 
With all your quaint Arabian nights, 
With all your old, historic sites, 
With all your gay electric lights, 
Why we love you so well 



MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT QUEZON 

TO MY BELOVED COUNTRYMEN IN 
THE UNITED STATES AND HAWAII: 

In the past few days, I have received from 
you many heart-warming birthday messages. I 
am deeply grateful to all of you for your remem- 
brance of my birthday. 

As you know, I came to the United States 
at the invitation of President Roosevelt in order 
to function as the head of the Commonwealth 
Government in exile as a symbol of the redemp- 
tion of the Philippines. 

This will be my second birthday anniversary 
since the Philippines fell under the sway of the 
Japanese military occupation. Through the long 
months of this occupation, our families, our rela- 
tives, our friends, our native towns, have suffered 
the aftermath of conflict and the hardships of 
alien oppression. Today, as always, I think of 
our people in their heavy ordeal, and my heart 
is sad. Although my health is not of the best, I 
dedicate my life to speeding the liberation of our 
beloved islands. 

To the men of the First and Second 
Filipino Infrantry Regiments, to the Filipinos 
who are serving in the United States Navy and 
Coast Guard, to the men of our Philippine mer- 
chant marine, I send my warm greetings. Upon 
you rests the responsibility to fulfill the dream 
of freedom for which our soldiers died on the 
battlefields in the Philippines. As you train and 
as you fight, my hand and heart go with you. 

To the thousands of Filipinos who are work- 
ing in the war industries and on the farms of 
America and Hawaii, I express my deep apprecia- 
tion of the constant and unflagging effort which 
you are putting into your labors. However pro- 
saic your job might have seemed in the days of 
peace, you know, as I know, that your labor is 
helping to hasten the day of victory. 

To all Filipinos who still breathe the air 
of freedom, I repeat our full-throated cry of 
hope — <T The Philippines Free Forever!" 



STATEMENT BY VICE-PRESIDENT SERGIO OSMENA ON THE 
OCCASION OF PRESIDENT QUEZON'S 65th ANNIVERSARY: 

On behalf of the eighteen million Filipinos in the enemy-invaded 
homeland, and of the thousands of Filipinos in the continental United 
States and Hawaii, I have the greatest pleasure in conveying to His Ex- 
cellency, President Manuel L. Quezon, the most heartfelt greetings on 
the occasion of his sixty-fifth birthday. 

I know that our people in the homeland, who have been sadly deprived 
of President Quezon's leadership and tragically forced to live under Japan's 
so-called f< New Order", are now looking back to the peaceful and construc- 
tive years of his happy regime and looking forward to the days which will 
bring him back to them. 

President Quezon has been their tried and tested leader for more 
than two decades, and his leadership has won fqr them progress and liberty, 
justice and honor. It was, in a great measure, his unwavering spirit that 
inspired them to fight valiantly and heroically against the Japanese. And 
today he symbolizes their undying spirit of resistance and their dogged 
determination to be free under a regime of democracy and liberty. 

But there is something more in the birthday of President Quezon. 
Today should be another occasion for all Filipinos to rededicate ourselves 
to the sacred cause for which he has stood and fought — the complete and 
final redemption of the Philippines. 

As we look forward to the future, across the mists of gloom and 
suffering, let us pray God to grant our leader many more years of life 
and strength so that, in the achievement of our destiny as a nation, we may 
continue to receive his inspiration and his wise guidance. 

SERGIO OSMENA, Vice*Pres. of the Philippines

Another important problem faced 
by President Quezon was that of 
economic readjustment, looking to- 
ward the situation of the Philippines 
when full independence would come. 
According to the Tydings-McDuffie 
Act, independence will be followed 
by the elimination of any preferen- 
tial commercial relationship between 
the United States and the Philip- 
pines. In order to meet the new 
problems that would inevitably re- 
sult from this, the Quezon admin- 
istration undertook many new pro- 
jects designed to secure economic 
as well as political independence for 
the Philippines. 

The President foresaw the expan- 
sion of the Axis war far beyond its 
original European boundaries. From 
1939 on, he carried out many mea- 
sures intended to safeguard the in- 
tegrity of the Commonwealth. But, 
in late 1941> the Japanese struck 
simultaneously at the United States 
and the Philippines. 

When General Mac Arthur de- 
cided to declare Manila an open 
city, President Quezon and his fam- 
ily ? together with a few members of 
the Commonwealth Government 
and the staff of the High Commis- 
sioner's office, moved to Corregidor. 
The President took the oath of office 
for his second term there. "The 
party subsequently left Corregidor 
and arrived in Australia on March 



Governor-General of the Philip- 
pines and from November, 1935 to 
December, 1936 was its first High 



3 



27. President Quezon arrived in 
the United States in May, 

Since that time, President Quezon 
has set up the Commonwea Ith Gov- 
ernment in Washington. On June 
J4 S 1942, President Quezon signed 
the Declaration by United Nations, 
in the name of the Philippine Com- 
monwealth, and thereby expressed 
Filipino adherence to the principles 
of the Atlantic Charter. In addition 
to this, the Philippines became an 
equal participant in the Pacific War 
Council, and President Quezon takes 
part in its deliberations. 

More recently President Quezon 
and President Roosevelt have jointly 
agreed to create a special Committee 
which would study the economic and 
other problems that will develop 
after victory and independence are 
secured. 

In the past year, the Philippines 
has emerged as a symbol of the true 
meaning of the Atlantic Charter 
and of the war aims of the United 
Nations. Its history during the past 
forty years is recognized as a sign- 
post pointing to what can be done 
for weaker people everywhere in the 
world. And President Quezon, as 
the beloved leader of the Filipino 
people, stands as the human symbol 
of worldwide freedom and self- 
government for all nations, large or 
small. Western or Eastern. 



Commissioner, paid the following 
tribute to President Manuel L. Que- 
zon on the anniversary of his arrival 
in the United States: 

"Just one year ago, President 
Quezon, you arrived in the United 
States to help direct from this free 
soil the destinies of your people in 
the Philippines. The physical dang- 
ers of the trip had been many and 
great, but they were as nothing to 
the spiritual travails you had under- 
gone in leaving your people. 

"Three choices were before you 
after the fall of Pearl Harbor. One 
was to become a Quisling. The 
lavish men ts of Japan for years had 
been futile in the face of your loyal- 
ty, for you are first a patriot. Even 
at Corregidor Japan made advances 
to you, thinking naively that you 
could be tempted from your un- 
swerving honor. That choice was, 
of course, unthinkable for you. 

"The second was to remain close 
to your people, defending and pro- 
tecting them with your last breath. 
This was what you really wanted to 
do, for your heart and soul were 
and ate today in the Philippines, 
The third choice was to follow the 
path desired by President Roosevelt, 
to join him in Washington and to 
serve actively in the program to 
oust the Japanese from your country 
and to bring freedom to your people, 

"No man's duty was ever harder 
than yours. Your heart was heavy, 
but your faith was high, and so you 
followed the course of duty to 
Washington where your energies 
could best serve your country and 
your people. 

"Between them and us exists noth- 
ing but goodwill and harmony. I 
recall the day in 1935, when you 
took the oath of office, after your 
people, exercising their free suf- 
frage had elected you as the first 
President of their Commonwealth, 
I listened, in front of the Legislative 
Building there in Manila, to your 
inspiring inaugural address. You 
spoke kindly words about the United 
States, Mr. President. You said 
the crowd gathered there were wit- 
nessmg the final stage in the fulfill- 
ment of the noblest undertaking 
ever attempted by any nation in 
dealing with another people, You 
said: 'And how well this task has 
been performed is attested to by the 
blessings which from fourteen mil- 
lion peopfe go to America in this 
solemn hourV

dent groups of Filipinos. The Fili- 
pinos of Washington, New York, 
Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles ? 
Seattle and of scores of other cities 
will observe this natal day of their 
beloved president — beloved because 
he is brave and a true patriot— 
on Thursday, the 19th,, with dances, 
some with patriotic programs, sqnVe 
with banquets. 

The Filipino Community of 
Stockton, Teofilo S, Suarez, presi- 
dent, will hold a dinner -da nee at the 
Civic Auditorium on Wednesday

Filipino Community of Reedley, 
under the presidency of Eugenio Ba- 
lucasj will observe the day with a 
dance at the American Legion Hall. 
Salinas, San Jose, San Francisco and 
other Bay Cities will do likewise. 
Instructions issued by Antonio A, 
Gonzales, president of the Filipino 
Inter-Community Organization of 
the Western States, are that the pro- 
ceeds out of these dances will be 
used to finance the Anti-Alien Land 
Law *lest Case" started by the Fili- 
pino Community of San Jose, led 
by its president, Primo Villaruz. 

Due to the neighboring commu- 
nities 1 holding their celebrations on 
the same night of the 19th, Fresno 
decided to hold its dance-program 
a couple of nights later, on Satur- 
day, the 21st, This assures a record

Philippine Heroes . . . 

Members Would Like to Hear from 
Kin of Soldiers in Philippine 

Campaign 
Only a little over a year old, this 
patriotic organization, SPONSORS 
of The PHILIPPINE HEROES, 
has grown to a membership of more 
than five hundred at present, mostly 
mothers, wives and sisters of Ameri- 
can soldiers who fought in that 
memorable battle in the Philippines; 
some of them dead, some of them 
captured and now held prisoners by 
the Japs. 

It was on May 6, last year, when 
the initial meting of this group was 
held, on the eve of the fall of Cor- 
regidor. Since then the members 
have been able to exchange letters 
and news with their loved ones in 
the Philippines for their mutual aid 
and comfort. 

"Our purpose," says Mrs. Marie 
Huston Maloseck, recording secre- 
tary of this patriotic society, "is to 
have every member of each branch 
of the armed forces registered with 
our organization so that when our 
boys come home we will be able to 
know more about the circumstances 
surrounding them during the per* 
form a nee in the Philippines. 

"It will be a great comfort for 
each family to be able to get in 
touch with the comrades of their 
own soldiers after the war is over. 

! *Also, it is our desire to lend 
mutual aid and comfort to them in 
every way possible and to plan these 
things we must have the cooperation 
of everyone interested. 

"We are also cooperating with 
several other organizations like the 
Women of Wake and the Philippine 
Society of Southern California." 

Headed by Mrs. Catherine Adams 
as president, the other officers are 
Mines. Kathetine Bailey, 1st vice- 
president; A + Mark, 2nd vice-presi- 
dent; Louise Fowler j recording sec- 
retary; Marie H* Ma lo seek, corre- 
sponding secretary; Velma Richard- 
son, treasurer. 

This organization of SPONSORS 
of The PHILIPPINE HEROES 
meets every second Sunday of the 
month, starting at 2:30 in the after- 
noon, at the Regent Apartment Hall, 
2403 West 6th Street. The next 
meeting will be on September 12. 

Members of this society are anx- 
ious to hear from other mothers and 
wives of American soldiers who 
fought in the Philippines. They 
like to exchange letters and news 
for their mutual benefit. Communi- 
cations may be addressed to the 
corresponding secretary at 6926 
Woodrow Wilson Drive, Hollywood 
California,

THE ADEVA PLAN 

During the 5th Annual Conference of the Filipino Inter-Community 
Organization of the Western States, at Stockton, July 1-4, the important 
subject the delegates were anxiously waiting to discuss was the rehabilitation 
program of the Philippines after the Jap hordes have been driven away 
from there. For months a plan that answers this vital need was being 
formulated at Washington, and as it came to completion it was called 
"The Adeva Plan/' after its author, Manuel A. Adeva, Nationals Division 
Assistant to the Resident Commissioner of the Philippines to the United 
States. 

Addressing the members on that subject, on Saturday afternoon, 
July 3, Mr. Adeva said that the approval of the PLAN by the Philippine 
Government could be "taken for granted because your gogovernment is 
vitally interested in your welfare. 

"It is my pleasure/ 3 he spoke, "to convey to you all the cordial greet- 
ings of President Quezon, Vice-President Osmena and Resident Com- 
missioner Elizalde. They are mindful of our problems and are solicitous 
of our welfare. They wish us not only to continue our contributions to 
the war effort, but also to formulate plans by which Filipinos in the United 
States and Hawaii can render active and effective participation in the post* 
war reconstruction period of the Philippines. 

"To better protect the rights and The Filipinos in the armed forces 

of the United States have already 
been assigned a definite and hazard- 
ous part. It is their job to free our 
country by force of arms from the 
savage conquerors. They lead the 
way and clear the path. It is our 
job — we soldiers of the home front 
— to follow them and rebuild over 
the ruins a richer Philippines— a 
Philippines where we and our child- 
ren should enjoy the four freedoms 
enunciated by President Roosevelt, 
namely, freedom of speech and ex- 
pression, freedom of religion, free- 
dom from want s and freedom from 
fear. 

"What can we, who are left be- 
hind to follow the soldiers, contri- 
bute to this tremendous job of re- 
construction? 

"The answer, my beloved country- 
men, is OUR SAVINGS. 

"Our country will need money 
with which to rebuild her basic in- 
dustries. Our country will need 
capital not only to rebuild but to 
develop and put into full use our 
vast natural resources. 

"Our soldier heroes can give no 
more; they already stand ready to 
sacrifice their lives for our country's 
redemption. Our people back home 
can contribute only a small amount 
towards this noble task. They are 
poor now and will be poorer after 
the Japanese shall have accomplish- 
ed their purpose of looting our 
country. 

"Clearly then it remains for us, 
you and me, who enjoy the freedom 
to work and" be paid good wages in 
this country to contribute oursavings 
towards this worthy and vitally nec- 
essary task. You and I must do our 
share in the rehabilitation of the 



interests of the Filipinos abroad, 
there was created in the Office of the 
Resident Commissioner of the Phil- 
ippines to the United States in 1939 
the Nationals Division under the 
direct supervision of our beloved 
leader, the late Honorable Francisco 
Varona. In April 1941, an agency 
of the Office for the West Coast was 
established with headquarters in San 
Francisco, California, for the pur- 
pose of extending a much greater 
service to the majority of the Fili- 
pinos in continental United States. 
A similar agency was under con- 
sideration for the Territory of Ha- 
waii when the war broke out, 

"The Nationals Division aided 
and encouraged the organization of 
Filipino communities all over the 
United States* These organized 
communities are recognized by the 
Office of the Resident Commissioner 
of the Philippines to the United 
States, They are the ones with 
which the Philippine Government 
contacts officially on all matters af- 
fecting Filipino Nationals within 
their respective jurisdictions- Inso- 
far as the organized communities 
of the Western States are concerned 
these official contacts are made 
through the Western Division of 
the Office of the Philippine Resident 
Commissioner in San Francisco,

dispute my statement that every free 
Filipino, that is every Filipino out- 
side of our unhappy land, is think- 
ing of the homeland and of his part 
in its reconstruction after the Japan- 
ese invaders have been driven out. 
I am sure every one of us feels deep 
down in his heart that he has— must 
have- — -a definite part in the rebuild- 
ing of our country after the war. 



Philippines. We can not and should 
not escape that responsibility. 

"Our hearts swell with a great 
feeling of patriotism when, on Rizal 
Days we stand and in unison sing 
T love my own my native land, 
Philippines, my Philippines/ That 
is as it should be. But how many of 
us who have sojourned long in this 
country can literally say that the 
Philippines is ours? Yes, the Phil- 
ippines is our country, but it belongs 
to others. We, the Filipinos, have 
a country but do not own it. What 
a tragedy! 

"Consider the following facts as 
contained in the Sixth Annual Re- 
port of the United States High Com- 
missioner to the Philippines to the 
President and Congress of the Uni- 
ted States covering the Fiscal year 
July 1, 1941 to June 30, 1942. 

Banking, manufacture, foreign 
trade, domestic wholesale and re- 
tail trading, public utilities includ- 
ing transportation and communi- 
cation services, mineral produc- 
tion, off-shore fishing, and lum- 
bering were principally in the 
hands of American, British, Chin- 
ese, and Japanese * * - . 

While nearly three- fourths of 
the area of the Philippines is suit- 
able for agriculture less than half 
had been brought into cultivation 
or pasturage; settlement of new. 
land had been painfully slow; * * . 
and the number of landless farm- 
ers increased annually. 
"Why were our basic industries, 
thelife-blood of our country, foreign 
controlled? Why was the land re- 
settlement project did not do so 
well? Why did the number of land- 
less farmers increase annually? The 
answer to each of these questions, 
my countrymen, is that our people 
lacked CAPITAL. What would our 
answer be after the war? If capital 
was lacking, capital we free Filipinos 
now have. 

"We are fighting, my beloved 
countrymen, for our freedom. From 
the valiant Lapulapu to our heroes 
on Bataan, Corregidor, and other 
battlefields, we have distinguished 
ourselves as fighters for liberty, and 
will continue to do so until the end 
of time. But have we stopped to 
consider that he who controls a 
nation's economy also controls its 
political destinies? 

"We are who are working here 
and making good money will have 
that great opportunity of controlling 
our country's economy by saving 
our money and investing it in the 
Philippines after the war is over. 
That is our glorious task. How are 
we to accomplish this?

"I am happy to inform you that 
your Government in Washington 
has a plan. It is a plan which de- 
pends upon you and me, all of us, 
for its accomplishment. 

"Your Government will agree to 
go into partnership with you in a gi- 
gantic business enterprise — the re- 
building of the Philippines, Your 
Government will agree to act as a 
depository or trustee for your sav- 
ings — the savings which you have 
agreed will be used as your invest- 
ment in the rebuilding of certain 
basic industries or in the develop- 
ment of our agricultural industry. 
Briefly, here is what your Govern- 
ment proposes to do: 

"You as an investor in the gigan- 
tic business enterprise, will send 
your savings to Washington, at so 
much a week, or a month. Your 
Government will send you a receipt 
for every dollar you send there. You 
send this money on the condition 
that you send the money for one 
purpose only — to invest it in the re- 
building of our country. 

"After the war, your Government 
will organize a corporation in the 
Philippines whose object is to take 
over and rebuild or develop cer- 
tain industries, say, the abaca in- 
dustry, lumbering, deep sea fishing 
or land resettlement. At that time 
you will be given shares of stock in 
this corporation corresponding to 
the total amount which has been 
accumulated in your account in* 
eluding interest. That is your Capi- 
tal investment in the reconstruction 
of our country. 

"Let us say that you as an investor 
decide that you want to develop 
a vast tract of land in Mindanao 
in order to assure our people of free- 
dom from want. You will be given 
so many hectares of land for so much 
of your investment, the balance to 
be retained as working capital with 
which to construct an irrigation sys- 
tem, to buy modern farm machinery 
and equipment. Then you who are 
experienced in modern scientific 
farming here in America can apply 
this valuable training in the develop- 
ment of this vital enterprise. You 
then would own a piece of land. 
Then and only then you and your 
children can truly say, 'This is my 
own, my native land. This is my 
land. The Philippines is my coun- 
try because I am part owner of it. 

"It is important, I think, that I 
must point out in this connection 
that not one penny of the money 
you send to Washington will be used 
to pay anybody who may be employ- 
ed to put this project into being* 
All that expense will be borne by 
our Government, 



"I must point out also that by 
participating in this great under- 
taking, you will be doing three 
things, all of which are of equal 
importance. First, your money will 
be used for buying war bonds as 
soon as received, thus helping in the 
war effort of the United Nations of 
which this country is a fully recog- 
nized member; second, you will have 
been encouraged to appreciate the 
value of saving; and third, your 
money will be used in the most im- 
portant task of rebuilding our coun- 
try. You will thus have laid down 
the foundation of your economic 
security. 

"The above is only an outline of 
this plan. I am going back to 
Washington but will be back — and 
when I come back, I will bring with 
me the complete machinery for put- 
ting this plan into effect. As you 
no doubt will understand, this whole 
program will have to be studied and 
approved by our Cabinet. But ap- 
proval is taken for granted because 
your Government is vitally inter- 
ested in your welfare . In his re- 
port to the Filipino people on Feb- 
ruary 20, 1943, President Quezon 
said: 'We shall secure for every Fili- 
pino the satisfaction of the basic 
human needs which are the rights 
of all men — food, clothing and shel- 
ter, and economic opportunity. With 
the help of the United States, we 
shall rebuild our ravaged land, and 
make of it a prosperous member 
of the family of nations', 

^Lastly , I wish to say again that 
our President, our Vice-President 
and our Resident Commissioner 
fully recognize the fact that you are 
the only FREE FILIPINOS in the 
world and want you to understand 
that they know that you are fully 
aware of your responsibility in do- 
ing your part to hasten the day 
when all our 17,000,000 countrymen 
wilt once again enjoy the glory and 
the honor of being called FREE 
FILIPINOS. MABUHAY!"

Pleiades Club 
Holds Meeting 

The Pleiades Club held its initial 
meeting on Sunday night, July 17 1 
at the home of Mrs. Ruth Mer- 
chant, on South Vista Street, Los 
Angeles. It was well attended by 
prominent guests and the principal 
speaker was Dr. John R. Lechner, 
executive director of the American- 
ism Educational League, whose topic 
was "The American- Japanese Situ* 
ation in California", The other 
speaker was Mrs. Merchant, past 
president of the Philippine Society. 
Mrs, Robert D. Pearson, president, 
presided* 

One of the highlights of Dr. 
Lechner's speech was the impending 
danger engendered by the move- 
ment of some 26,000 ministers to 
offer a negotiated peace with Japan 
by the end of this year, and these 
same church leaders working for 
the release of the Japs from the re- 
location centers. The whole audi* 
ence was unanimous with Dr. Lech- 
ner in their condemnation of these 
unpatriotic activities of these "re- 
ligious leaders''. The speaker also 
related many subversive movements 
of the Japs in California and else- 
where. 

The Pleiades is an exclusive Club 
membered by many of the promin- 
ent women in Southern California. 
The meeting was the first of a series 
of "World Peace" forums which the 
Club sponsors monthly, or oftener. 

Committee members who assisted 
the president in welcoming members 
and guests were Mesdames Bertha 
Brown, Buena Vista Stine, Eleanor 
Wilson McAdoo, Pilar Hidalgo Lim 
and Marie Huston Maloseck, 

The honor guests included Mrs, 
Helen Girvin, director of the Book 
and Author Luncheon Club; Mrs. 
Thomas Doolittle, past president of 
the Interfraternity Mothers Club of 
the University of Southern Cali^ 
fornia; J. Allen Boone, author, and 
Dr. Maneck K. Anklesaria, India. 

Refreshments were served after 
the meeting, and guests were intro- 
duced to each other. There was a 
Korean gentleman among the guests, 
and the only other Filipino besides 
Mrs. Lim was the editor of The 
OBSERVER. 

The next meeting wilt be on Sun- 
day night, August 15, with John 
Carver as the guest speaker, Mr. 
Carver is an international corres- 
pondent just back from the Solo- 
mons.

Christening Party 

The little town of Pleasanton had 
an all-day feasting and dancing on 
Sunday, August 8, on the occasion 
of the baptism of the child of Mr. 
and Mrs. T. Garcia. The baby was 
christened Johnny Garcia, The party 
was held at Ides Hall, and friends 
of the couple and the godfathers 
and godmothers came from nearby 
cities as San Jose, Oakland, Sacra- 
mento, Stockton and other places. 

Although the Garcias were Mexi- 
cans, the padrinos were Filipinos: 
Tom as Matas and Egmidio Berano; 
and two Mexican young ladies, Con- 
cepcion and Jesusita Hernandez, 
were the madrinas. 

About three-quarters of an hour 
was consumed by the program, 
mostly singing, but eating and re- 
freshments were had at any time. 



It's a Boy at Tinazas 

1 heir prayers answered, Leo T. 
Tinaza and his wife, Sally, are still 
exulting over the birth of their first 
offspring, a BOY, last July 2. 

Mr. Tinaza is the Second Wor- 
shipful Master of EAGLE Lodge 
613, LDT, of Anaheim. Mrs. Tin- 
aza was the former Miss Celia Gal- 
lego, very popular in Filipino-Ameri- 
can-Mexican social affairs. They 
were married February 8, 1942. 

When querried as to when the 
christening would be, the happy 
couple said "Next September, about 
the end of that month". Fellow 
members in the Legionarios Del 
Trabajo, and friends of the Tinazas* 
are looking forward to that christen- 
ing event. Definite date and place 
will be announced later.

has there been such abundant op- 
portunity as there is now for the pet- 
son who is willing to serve before 
crying to collect*

GRAND DELEGATE CRUZ ISSUES 
MESSAGE TO LEGIONARIOS 



At present we are concerned with 
the prevailing trend of the times. 
Everyone is concerned with fighting 
and beating the enemy, It is with 




Antonio R* Cruz 



justified pride to observe that several 
hundred Legionarios were all eager 
and willing to be inducted, white 
others voluntered, into the armed 
forces of Uncle Sam, proving their 
patriotism to the Philippines, their 
loyalty to America and their love 
for the Legionarios Del Trabajo. 

This is a time when we have the 
opportunity to prove, in addition 
to our patriotism, loyalty and love 
— our unity, not only as Filipinos 
but also as Legionarios. This is a 
time when we should stick together 
closer than ever befor . This is a 
time when we should not neglect 
the teachings of our Fraternal Or- 
der. This is a time when we should 
pool together our united efforts and 
work even harder, to make up for 
the absence of Brothers who have 
temporarily left us, since many of 
them have been and are being in- 
ducted into the U. S. Army. 

Just because many of us are being 
called into the service, it does not 
mean that we should lose courage 
and dampen our spirit with an un- 
pleasant thought that maybe our 
Fraternity would weaken and dis- 
integrate. Such an attitude should 



be aliqn to our progressive thoughts. 
Despite present conditions,, the LDT 
will remain strong or become weak 
only according to the way we handle 
the situation. 

Our beloved countrymen back in 
the Islands — our parents, relatives, 
friends — fought desperately and 
bore the brunt of the war. We here 
in America are eagerly waiting for 
our chance to join them there. For* 
tunate are those who have already 
been called. And we whose luck 
has not yet come, let us do in the 
meantime, our utmost to maintain 
and preserve the noble and proud 
name of FILIPINO; and that we 
can accomplish better if we work 
together as a body — as Legionarios, 

Let us stick to our respective 
Lodges, work hard and serve faith- 
fully out of respect for the Brothers 
who are now with the Armed Forces 
of America. By doing that we do 
them honor. And we honor our 
country, our race and our Frater- 
nity. 

I beseech you all, therefore, Bro- 
thers and Sisters, to reinforce your- 
selves with faith, hope and courage, 
and with a determination that pre- 
sent conditions should spur us on 
to make our Fraternity a more use* 
fulj helpful and faithful organiza- 
tion — a Fraternity of patriotic men 
and women, a Fraternity whose 
members are in the service of Uncle 
Sam, while those who are left be- 
hind do their part just the same, 
by their united efforts in cooperating 
and collaborating with other peoples 
and organizations in activities lead- 
ing to ultimate victory. 

On top of this message, I wish to 
extend, on behalf of the Legion- 
arios Del Trabajo in America, my 
heartiest f elicitatiqns to our great 
President and leader, the Honorable 
Manuel L. Quezon, who is also 
Honorary President of our Frater- 
nal Order, on this his 65th birthday. 

My fellow Legionarios, we need 
each other now even more than be- 
fore. Let us stick together, work 
harder — and keep the Fraternal

Filipino Regiment 
Receives Rolos 

Elaborate Military Ceremony 
Staged for Occasion 

Three months of arduous work 
by a Southern California citizens 5 
committee, seeking funds to buy 
bolo knives for Filipino troops, were 
brought to a brilliant climax last 
month, when the first of specially 
manufactured jungle fighting weap- 
ons were presented to the Second 
Filipino Infantry regiment at Camp 
Cooke. 

The presentation was made by 
Albert Rebel, Los Angeles business- 
man, who has given all his time to 
the fund-raising campaign. As a 
participant in the impressive cere- 
monies, Mr. Rebel addressed the 
Filipino regiment both in English 
and in Tagalog, the official Filipino 
language. 

Receiving the bolos for the Sec- 
ond Infantry was Col. Charles L. 
Clifford, regimental commanding 
officer, while later ceremonies in- 
cluded presentations by Mr. Rebel 
to 18 platoon commanders in the 
regiment. 

On hand as personal representa- 
tive of Manuel L. Quezon, president 
of the Commonwealth of the Philip- 
pine was Major General Basilio J. 
Valdez, chief of staff of the Philips 
pine Army and secrerary of national 
defense for the Philippines. 

Accompanying Mr, Rebel on rhe 
trip to Camp Cooke for the program 
were Charles P. Bayer, secretary of 
the Los Angeles Chamber of Com- 
merce, which sponsored rhe drive 
for bolo knife funds; Ray Rauen, 
vice-president and general manager 
of the United States Spring and 
Bumper Co,, manufacturer of the 
bolo knives; Dr. Marvel Beem, past 
district governor of Rotary Inter- 
national; H + W. Bragg, official of 
the Union Oil Company; and Lowell 
Arnold, secretary of the Rotary Club 
of El Monte. 

The drive for funds to buy bolo 
knives for presentation to the Fili- 
pino soldiers started out as a quiet 
projecr among a small group of Los 
Angeles businessmen but has now 
focused national attention on an 
achievement in civilian contribution 
to the war effort and to international 
goodwill.

Philippine* Ame: 



Among women of the Far East 
the Filipino woman has long been 
known as the most advanced and 
most progressive. In fact, socially 
and legally, she enjoys all the rights 
and privileges of the modern Ameri- 
can or British woman. 

It would be interesting to know 
how Filipino women are actually 
reacting toward the Japanese, who 
presume to be preparing the Philip- 
pines for independence, in the light 
of the Nipponese attitude toward 
women. If the Japanese have any 
intention of undermining the Fili- 
pino woman's position in society and 
the home, they are in for a hard and 
probably losing fight because the 
Filipino woman is very jealous of 
her rights and privileges. The 
Japanese can never relegate the Fili- 
pino woman to the servile status of 
women in Japan. 

t? The old style Japanese who 
loudly proclaim to the world the 
superiority of Japan's 'spiritual civil- 
ization* are neither polite nor gentle- 
manly in the Western sense, they are 
merely ceremonious and formal/' 
says Freda Utiey in her book Japan's 
Feet of Clay, *Tn the streets women 
carry packages and luggage whilst 
their men walk in front unburdened. 
Any man who treats his wife with 
consideration is regarded as a dan- 
gerous radi|al or at best a crank. 

"It is of course above all with 
regard to the treatment of women 
that Japan has retained her Asiatic 
rnoeurs. Both social customs and 
the laws keep woman in subjection 
and give her a status only one de- 
gree removed from slavery. The 
Japanese woman has no legal per- 
sonality, no social or political rights; 
she can be sold to a factory or a 
brothel by a legal contract signed by 
her father or husband or other male 
guardian, she can be divorced with- 
out cause at the will of her husband; 
a married woman has no property 
rights, and no rights over her chil- 
dren. Women are forbidden by 
law to join a political party and by 
social custom from going to places 
of entertainment with their hus- 
bands, from dancing or from any 
social intercourse with the other sex. 
Yet whilst women remain subject 
to a medical or patriarchal code 
which deprives them of all liberty, 
they are exposed to all the brutality 
of the early forms of capitalist ex- 
ploitation. They may not enjoy the 
social or political rights of men but 
they have to earn their living side 
by side with men in offices and fac- 
tories and farms." 

In sharp contrast to the Japanese 
woman's status of semi-slavery is 
that of the Filipino woman. Says 
Dr. Maria Paz Mendoza-Guazon,

woman leaders in the Philippines,

To the Filipinos, this is not an 
unusual state of affairs. Before the 
coming of the Spaniards in the six- 
teenth century, the women enjoyed 
total equality with the men. Even 
then a married woman could dis- 
pose of her property without her 
husband's consent. A married 
woman in the District of Columbia 
could not do so until 1926. The

become the head of her community

without escort. 

During the American regime Fili- 
pino women recovered all the rights 
and privileges they possessed in pre- 
Spanish days. In 1933 Gov. Gen. 
Frank Murphy signed the woman's 
suffrage bill, for which the Filipino 
women had long fought. Since then 
many women have been elected 
municipal councilors, mayors and

Book of Poems 
For Cat Lovers 

Miss Lynn Hamilton, California 
poet, whose home is in Pomona, is 
engaged in a project of an unusual 
nature. She is compiling an anthol- 
ogy of verses concerning cats. She 
proposes to publish this in book 
form sometime after the war is 
over. It will be called "SOPHISTI- 
CATS," with the sub-title, "Poems 
for Cat Lovers — from Every State 
in the Union and Beyond the Seven 
Seas". 

In her letter to the editor of The 
OBSERVER Miss Hamilton says: 
"I am having difficulty contacting 
writers from other nations — especial- 
ly now that the war interferes with 
communications. If you know any 
writers who do verse, please rope 
them in. I would especially like to 
have some poems in other languages 
with English translations. I have 
French poems from the classics but 
no modern ones. I suppose if this 
anthology was composed of war 
poems more would be interested ? 
but I'm weary of fighting and killing 
. ♦ . Am a cat lover myself and as 
there are so many dog lovers I de- 
cided I would do my bit for the cat. 
I would like to see the book go into 
other countries after the war for all 
people who like cats * . - and am 
anxious to have the Philippines 
represented in this collection of 
poems. 

Among the authors whose verses 
will be included in the volume are 
Oliver Wendell Holmes, George 
Stirling, Algernon and Edwin Mark- 
ham. Modern poems will be those 
of Don Blandmg, Gillet Burgess, 
Berton Bralev, Sophie Kerr, and 
many other well J khown present-day 
writers. 

In order to make contact with 
poets in foreign countries, Miss 
Hamilton is writing to the editors 
of foreign newspapers and maga- 
zines. She will welcome suggestions 
from readers who may be able to 
put her in touch with foreign poets. 

dor. Today, under the Japanese 
occupation, it is certain that women 
of the Philippines are pillars of 
strength, holding together family 
life and keeping alive the traditions 
of freedom — preparing for the day 
of liberation.

When the Lights Go On Again Lgjggg 



By Marjorie Paton Espanol 3 Associate Editor 




The currently popular song, 
"When The Lights Go On Again/' 
promises a pleasant picture of life 
and. love after the war. So do the 
war slogans which urge us to 1 'Fight 
for the American Way of Living" 
and "Buy Bonds to maintain the 
American Standard", All the econ- 
omists—would-be and professional 
— have their erudite craniums to- 
gether for the purpose of mapping 
out a post-war Utopia. 

Probably, to most of us, the prom- 
ise of peace means the lifting of 
various restrictions which now in- 
hibit our lives; porterhouse steaks 
will miraculously re-appear on our 
menus ; tires will again screech as 
the younger set swish around cor- 
ners on three wheels; paying speed 
tickets will again enter our budgets; 
co-eds will no longer ration dates; 
"cokes" will be guzzled by the 
quart. 

In other words, we expect a gen- 
eral "as you were" condition to 
appear. We forgot that after a 
great crisis, such as we face now, 
the pendulum of events must swing 
forward — not back. 

Not so long ago we passed thru 
another national crisis— the depres- 
sion. Long faces accompanied 
mournful chants across the land as 
sighs rose for "the good old days 
of >27 and '28" when Wall Street 
suckers became millionaires over- 
night — on paper. We weathered 
the depression via the New Deal 
course. Prosperity slowly returned, 
not in paper wealth to the tune of 
heavy installment purchases, but in 
the solid sense of security to the 
masses. 

In other words, after the panic of 
depression, prosperity did return. 
But the "good old days" were gone 
and vanished into the limbo of 
eternity. 

Today we are pegged up in full 
gear, living every second round the 
clock, riding on our nerve, working 
too long and too hard, worrying too 
much. We know that the boys on 
the battle fronts face the real pun- 
ishment of war in its most hideous 
form. We at home try to outwit 
our imaginations by lashing our- 
selves to a feverish pitch of work. 
We dare not stop to think even for 
an instant lest we glimpse the truth 
too clearly. 

Some day the war will be over. 
Some day there will be peace on 



earth. Some day our boys — bro- 
thers, husbands, fathers, sweethearts 
—will come home. 

And some day our jobs will be 
finished at the shipyards, in the air- 
craft factories, in the munitions 
plants, in all the thousand and one 
institutions that furnish implements 
of war. 

And the day our jobs are finished 
our pay checks stop. 

What comes then? What then 
happens to those of us who now 
have more spending money than we 
have ever known before? In what 
place in the sun will the expatriated 
Filipinos find themselves when the 
bells of peace toll? 

Thousands of the Filipinos who 
return will be American citizens 
elevated from a vague status as 
aliens to men who have learned the 
truths of democracy the hard way — 
via blood and sweat and agonizing 
pain. Will these returning heroes, 
conscious of their new dignity and 
responsibility, be satisfied to again 
be relegated to the stations of bus 
boys and cooks and general serv- 
ants? 

Will they continue to be called 
"boys" or will some great liberated 
minds kindly refer to them as 
"men"? 

I have talked to many Filipino 
soldiers about their plans after the 
war. I have seen many of them 
transformed by a chevron on the 
sleeve from play boys into serious- 
minded men. With very few ex- 
ceptions they all like Army life. 
They like the routine of hard work, 
heavy eating, regular hours of sleep- 
ing. Hundreds of them were on the 
brink of physical and moral disaster 
when the Army herded them off the 
streets. 

The contrast between the pre-war 
Filipino and the specimen of today 
is almost as sharp as the contrast 
remarked by Frederic S. Marquardt 
in his hook, "Before Bataan And 
After," in which he compares the 
attitude of the people in the Islands 
under Spanish rule and after thirty 
years under the United States. He 
states that "by 1942 the Filipinos 
had traveled so far , . * toward self- 
respect that he not only looked the 
jap in the eye. He spit in his eye." 

None of the Filipinos I have 
questioned expect to return to their 
former jobs. In other words, as a 
class, they are through as "servants", 
They gladly bequest that status to 



any other minority group that will 
accept it. 

Many of them have been initiated 
into the mysteries of mechanism in 
the Army. They expect to turn 
their knowledge into useful trades 
later. Those in the defense plants 
have also learned trades. They have 
also learned to enjoy the "feel" of 
money in their pockets. The pit- 
tances they received in their old jobs 
no longer appeal to them. 

After the war they expect to go 
into competition with American 
labor, joining the long queues of 
thousands of others forced out of 
work. 

Among those thousands there may 
be some who will remember there is 
a little country which they fought 
to liberate. They may foresee that 
out of its shattered barrios cities will 
rise, that from Maiacanang Palace 
a great flag will proudly wave, a 
symbol of a free nation at peace. 

It will take great courage and 
hard work to re-build the Philip- 
pines. The dead will have given 
them courage while Army discipline 
will have toughened them to hard 
work. 

These then will be the real heroes 
after the war. These shall earn 
monuments from their fellow men; 
To those brave enough to live — 
for the Philippines. They along 
can proudly say, "This is OUR 
land!" 



The population of the Philippines 
(18,000,000) is greater than that of 
any country in the Western Hemi- 
spere, except the United States, Bra- 
zil and Mexica. Its land area 
(115,600 square miles) is greater 
than that of the British Isles, 

★ * * 

Filipinos settled in America about 
1710. They arrived in Louisiana, 
and were known as Malays, but their 
descendants today still claim to be 
Filipinos. One of their settlements, 
not far from New Orleans, has long 
been known as Manila Village. 

* * * 

The Phil ippine flag was turned 
upside down on December 8, 1941, 
when the Japanese attacked. By 
law, the flag is flown with the bule 
on top in time of peace, and the red 
in time of war.

Soldiers Hold. 
Festive Day 

The dance and lechonada party 
of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Filipino 
Infantry, at the Hunter Liggett Mil- 
itary Reservation, Camp Roberts, on 
Sunday, the first of this month, was 
a rave success- It was an all-day al 
fresco affair and the attendance of 
more than six hundred people — 
soldiers and civilians — was the 
biggest crowd ever assembled at any 
gathering of Filipinos and their 
American friends so far this year 
anywhere in the State. 

Starting with a mass at the Mis- 
sion San Antonio, at 11:30 in the 
morning, the party retreated to the 
picnic grounds to partake of the 
lechon whetted with soft drinks — 
and, oh, yes, some beer, too! The 
hosts — the soldiers, you know {as 
if you didn't know} were too much 
in a hurry to dance; so, the baboy 
was no sooner chewed and the 
drinks no sooner licked from the 
bottles than the 1st Filipino Infan- 
try orchestra struck — and a- dancing 
most of the lads and the lassies 
went! (Lads, that day, meant sold- 
iers) . 

Interpolating the dances was a 
well prepared program participated 
in by such songstresses as the Misses 
Mary Alice Espiritu and Frances 
Begley of San Francisco, petite Mar- 
tha Braga of Stockton, Consuelo 
Gaeer of Lodi, Dolores Catalia of 
Oakland and Pacita Todtod of San 
Jose; and singers Pfc. Vicente Serna 
and Pvt. Rustico Yparraguirre; 
everyone sang solos. Exhibition 
dances were performed by the 
Misses Betty Paredes of San Fran- 
cisco and Virginia Garcia of Oak- 
land (the latter a hula-hula), with 
AI Nepumoceno tapping for the 
Army. Stanley Orbeta played a 
guitar solo and Pvt. A, Baldonedo 
a violin solo. 

Speeches, of course, there were — 
by S Sgt. Sergio V. Solidarios, who 
was in the finance committee and 
one of the hardest workers for the 
event; Capt. Abdon Llorente, Major 
Talman C Budd and Lt. CoL Geo. 
L, Mann. 

One of the features of the day 
was athletics. The Filipina Athletic 
Club of Stockton, invited thru their 
manager, Catherine S. Cruz, went 
there to conquer the soldiers — and 
the soldiers conquered the girls! 
The FAC suffered its first defeat in 
softball— at the very hands of their 
soldier boys! But they came back 
■ — the charm fuls came back— to am- 
azon the bold hearts in volleyball 
to the tune of 31 to 271

THE ILOILO CIRCLE 



The Iloilo Circle had an interest- 
ing beginning. It was early in 193$, 
when Stockton Filipinos were 
making preparations to welcome the 
late Francisco Varona on his first 
official visit to Stockton ,that the 
natives of the province of Iloilo 
bethought themselves of going even 
a bit further than the community; 
they planned to stage a salo-salo 




Federico D. Luntao 



(get-together dinner) party for the 
noted labor leader, himself being 
an Ilongo also. 

Nine Iloilo natives got into an in- 
formal discussion about the pro- 
posed dinner. It materialized on 
March 12, 1938, after the one, 
sponsored by the community, was 
held, And it turned out to be quite 
a success, too. Elated by that, the 
nine were joined by many other 
Ilongos present at the party and on 
that same night they organized 
themselves into a new society — the 
Iloilo Circle, Ernesto Dalipe was 
elected president. Within a short 
time the Circle was incorporated as 
a non-profit organization. 

Election of officers is yearly. Pla- 
cid o D. Lazaro was elected presi- 
dent for 1939. He was succeeded 
by Benito Dalipe, 1940. On Decem- 
ber 25, 1941, election day, Federico 
D. Luntao became president. Last 
Christmas Day he was reelected. Ml 
Luntao is also a member of MA- 
BINI Lodge 610, LDT, and fore- 
man of the K. R« Nutting Company. 
He believes in food as one of the 
chief means of winning this war. 

At present the Iloilo Circle, Inc. 
is about the biggest and strongest 
provincial organization of Filipinos 



in the United States. There are 
branches in Los Angeles, Chicago 
and other cities but they are not so 
active as the mother group in 
Stockton. 

It can always be relied upon when 
it comes to civic and patriotic move- 
ments. It has contributed much to 
the war effort and is constantly do- 
ing so. It took active part in the 
big drive for War Relief Fund in 
Stockton, early in 1942; the Annual 
Red Cross Drive; and the big Bond 
Drive, sponsored by the Filipino 
Community of Stockton, last 
September, 

The Circle maintains its club 
headquarters on South Hunter St. 
One of the big events the Filipinos 
of Stockton are eagerly awaiting is 
the Autumn Dance of the Circle. It 
will be on Saturday night, Septem- 
ber 4, at Eagles Hall. From all in- 
dications, it will have a record at- 
tendance because prexy Luntao and 
his committee who have been in- 
viting the young Filipinas in the 
city and neighboring places, have 
been receiving assurances of their 
presence. 

*It will be a night worth remem- 
bering," says Mr. Luntao. "How 
could anyone help remembering it 
when glamour prevades the atmo- 
sphere within the hall!"

church ceremonies were over; so he 
was proxied by his good friend,

was Mr. Goza who asked Al Dan-

for him till he could have several

He rushed back to San Francisco

Koetters-Krause Wedding 



FARMER and MUSICIAN 




AS 




Mrs. Keepers, formerly buyer for a large 
Department Store in Chicago. 

The buxon and charming Miss 
Louise Krause, formerly of Chicago, 
and tall, statuesque Joseph Koetters 
of San Jacinto, were married last 
April 28, at St. Anthony's Catholic 
Church, San Jacinto, The ceremony 
was performed by the Rev. Joseph 
Mackey, 

News of the nuptials, however, 
did not reach the couple's friends in 
Los Angeles until just recently. 

According to a San Jacinto news- 
paper, the bride looked even more 
charming in her pink lace and chif- 
fon gown and a pink picture hat, 
She carried a bridal boquet of Ce- 
cil Brunner roses. Mr. and Mrs. 
Charles Hawk were best man and 
matron of honor. 

After the wedding the couple and 
their friends retreated to the home

Johnny Florendo 



Johnny Florendo is a farmer now. 
Fight fans around this region will 
remember him as a tough fighting 
featherweight trying to make a niche 
for himself in fistiana. That was in 
1931-34, and "Filipino Tornado" 
was his nom de guerre. He had 
more than 30 fights, all professional. 

"But my heart was hot in it," he 
said. He knew there was no future 
in it. He scanned the examples of 
Filipino fighters, champions and 
near champions. All of them, with 
the exception of the late Dencio 
Cabanela and Pancho Villa, did not 
fare so well, in fact, many turned 
out to be bums. 

He left cauliflower alley before it 
was too late, What he made in the 
ring was only about enough to pay 
for bills in "normalizing" his ears 
and nose. Then he took up music 
lessons; and farming. Nearly ten 
years of hard work on the farm and 
earnest study in music showed good 
results. Now he is a member of the 
Manila Swingsters, playing the saxo- 
phone. When he has spare time he 
spends it in swimming. Some people 



remark that Johnny looks sorta like 
Phil Harris? 

"But farming is my line," he de- 
clares. "Food is a vital factor in 
this war and the major part of the 
battle on the home front is on the 
farm." 

Florendo is a native of Naguilian, 
La Union. He is a member of 
NOLI ME TANGERE Lodge 516 
LDT. 

He works on the farm and plays 
with the Manila Swingsters evenings 
when the orchestra is engaged.

From Soldier to Farmer Bens' Bundle of Joy 




Pedro Jasmin 



Recently released from the U. S. 
Army, Pedro Jasmin is now pro- 
ducing food for the men in Uncle 
Sam's forces and our Allies. He is 
employed at a farm in Woodbridge, 
a few miles from Stockton. 

Mr. Jasmin was living in San 
Francisco when he was inducted last 
year. He was 2nd Worshipful Mas- 
ter of NOLI ME TANGERE Lodge 
516, LDT, of that city. When he 
left the army, where he was a ser- 
geant, 2nd Filipino Infantry, at 
Camp Cooke, he received a high 
commendation from both the bat- 
talion commander and his company 
commander for his efficiency and 
thoroughness in executing com- 
mands. 

He was sergeant-instructor and 
was put in charge of recruits of the 
2nd Filipino Infantry. He was the 
recipient of several gifts during the 
"despedida" party given in his 
honor. 

At 20 a young man's big problem is 
how to make women fall for him; a few 
years later, it is how to prevent them from 
landing him — Helen Rowland.

Phillip Christopher Ben, Jr. 

This little bundle of joy is the 
first offspring of Phillip Ben and 
his wife Estella. And his name is 
Phillip Christopher Ben, Jr. Master 
Phillip was born last March 6. 

Mr. and Mrs. Ben were married 
at Anaheim in May, 1942. Phillip 
was a resident of Atascadero, while 
the wife was the popular Miss Estel- 
la Abarquez of Placentia, just a few 
miles from Anaheim. She was the 
principal of the adorable "Abarquez 
Trio", popularly known in the 
Southland as "The Filipino An- 
drews Sisters". 

The Bens have bought a home 
of their own in Atascadero where 
they expect to reside indefinitely. 
They are at present in Stockton 
visiting with Mr. and Mrs. Antonio 
R. Cruz. 

Says Mrs. Ben: "Maybe we are 
overly enthusiastic about Junior, 
but Phil and I are centering a great 
deal of our planning for the future 
on him. He is the cutest little darl- 
ing thing, isn't he?" 

This little bundle of joy is the 
cutest little darling thing, sure he is! 

Riches only adorn the home, but vir- 
tue adorns the person.

Phil ippine-American Observer 



New Aircraft Carrier Is Named Bataan 

Indicative of the great pride the United States entertains for the 
heroism displayed by Americans and Filipinos in the Battle of the Phil- 
ippines, the latest aircraft carrier launched by the Navy was named after 
Bataan, according to the Philippine Office of Special Services. The U, S. S. 
Bataan was the first American aircraft to be named after a World War II 
campaign. 

"No ship bears a more illustrious name," said Secretary of the Navy 
Frank Knox in his message to President Manuel L. Quezon informing 
him of the new warship s launching at the yards of the New York Ship- 
building Corporation in Camden, New Jersey. "The U. S. S* Bataan 
commemorates a campaign that has become a symbol of the fortitude 
and endurance of free men in the face of overwhelming odds. It has a 
rendezvous with destiny that shall not be denied. I know that you and 
your brave people will join with all Americans in wishing the Bataan and 
the men who will sail in her Godspeed and good hunting," 

President Quezon replied to Secretary Knox: 

"I am delighted to learn of the launching of the United States air- 
craft carrier Bataan. The valor of the American and Filipino fighting 
men who battled through the long months on Bataan will serve as an in- 
spiration to the men of this fine new ship. To the people of the Philippines, 
who live only for the day of victory and liberation, the Bataan will be a 
symbol of the inevitable defeat of Japan. Our fighting comradeship was 
sealed in the foxholes of Bataan, and hallowed forever in the shallow 
graves of that bloodstained bit of land. Today our hearts go with the 
men who built this ship, with the sailors who will man her, and with the 
aviators who will take off from her flight deck. In the name of the Fil- 
ipino people, I extend to all of them my most fervent wishes for good 
fortune and speedy victory." 

Vice-President Sergio Osmena, accompanied by his daughter Maria 
and Col. Manuel Nieto, represented the Philippines and President Quezon 
at the launching ceremonies. Mis Osmena acted as maid of honor to the 
sponsor, Mrs. George D. Murray, wife of the Rear Admiral Commandant 
of the United States Naval Air Training Station at Pensacola, Florida. 



Sign Painting Is 
Big Business 

In Los Angeles sign painting is 
certainly big business. At least to 
Frank Sandoval who made it so 
himself. Frank, brilliant, suave and 
debonair, is an artist of no mean 
ability. He has weilded the brush 
for many, many a year. 

About a decade ago Mr. Sando- 
val had his establishment called 
"Frank's Signs/' It was still de- 
pression time, nevertheless he fared 
well. Few years following he had 
more business than he could take 
care of. 

"The whole Main Street is mine!" 
Frank Sandoval released the state- 
ment et ah Good artists — of the 
Sandoval standard — were hard to 
find. With Frank not just any sign 
painter would do; he's got to be an 
expert to join the Sandoval clan. 

At present Mr, Sandoval has his 
studio named "Olvera Signs," lo- 
cated at 604 North Main Street. 
And with his partner, R, Morin, and 
an expert assistant, they are now 
able to fill up orders promptly and 
satisfactorily. 

Frank is a veteran of World War 
L He was with the U. S. Navy. He 
and his wife Margaret (Inday) are 
always dependable when it comes 
to helping in the civic and patriotic 
movements of Filipinos in Los An-

Issuing the Philipine-Amcrican OB- 
SERVER in its new form merely answers 
the numerous mid repented suggestions 
of readers and friends, all to the same 
effect, that it be turned into a magazine. 

Since its inception the OBSERVER has 
been a tabloid, except in 1937 when, it 
came out in standard newspaper size; 
then reverted to tabloid. 

The magazine form is satisfactory to 
me. A publication that does not come out 
oftcner than once a month should be is- 
sued in magazine form. The OBSERVER 
came out fortnightly when it was in tab- 
loid. Except, of course, when the pnper 
is bi£ l^e the Philippines Star Press which 
I am also editing in Los Angeles; it is of 
regular newspaper size, 14 to 16 pages 
each issue. Publisher B. G. Aquino is justi- 
fied in putting it out only once a mouth. 
The Star Press, by the way, is one of the 
most consistent Filipino papers in the 
country, having been on the field for 
more than ten years* 

This is the initial number of the OB- 
SERVER in magazine form, And I shall 
keep it that way* I have domiciled its 
main office in Stockton because at the 
present time Stockton has the biggest 
Filipino population in the United States. 
Los Angeles, up to three years ago. was 
the U. S. Philippine capital, in point of 
population. Now it is Stockton and in all 
likelihood it will keep its Filipino resi- 
dents here even long after this war is over, 

I have been visiting Stockton for well 
nigh two years now* at times sojourning 
here for as long as four or five days, and 
during those visits } had occasions to be 
with we 11 -known Filipinos* nearly all of 




them farmers and businessmen, and I 
have been prevailed upon to resume my 
publication here or start a new one, 

Of course, I would not start a new one. 
The OBSERVER has been a fine publi- 
cation, if I may say it, and it seems to be 
the logical mouthpiece for the thousands 
of Filipinos not only of Stockton but also 
of other parts of the United States. 

The OBSERVER'S slogan is "The 
Champion of Filipino Welfare and 
Square Deal". This magazine commits it- 
self to that, will live up to that slogan. 
This is an independent organ, has no axe 
to grind, bound to no political group, 
controlled by no "big shot" or clique. 

This number has been prepared in such 
a short time— nine days to be exact— and 
in such a hurry, In order to come out be- 
fore the 19th; and being all alone, the 
work was a bit difficult. It was nonetheless 
a pleasure doing it, having in mmd the 
bought that this issue is dedicated to one 
of the great men of the *T * 

proven statesmanship, leadership nnd pa 
Triotism: Manuel U Quezon. This . a 
wry humble way of showing bomage 
.nd love to a man of President Q^on 
gr eatness~but the heart that off ers >t . 
a, big as ,ho Philippines itself, h w,)I not 

md Americans feel the same way. a, they 
think of him on bis natal day. 

Subsequent issues of this maga.me will 
,ee improvements. Within its covers rcad^ 
It Ji find Nicies on divers subject 
—economic*, labor, government, social 
affairs, sports and the vital top.es of the 
day— rhat will be valuable and mterestmg 
to r aad. Besides feature articles there will 



be a literary section, a short story when 
it could be obtained, a "Flowers of the 
Race" section, and miscellaneous things. 
In other words, readers will have a maga- 
zine that will not be boring to read. 

The Philippine-American OBSERVER 
cemes to Stockton with no obligations or 
indebtedness left behind in Los Angeles. 
I believe it is important to mention that. 
I have never solicited subscriptions, have 
always refused to accept them when off- 
ered, and all those that have been sent 
in through the mail have been returned, 
every one of them. This was because I was 
not so sure if I could keep the paper 
steady. When I was quite "green" in this 
work I accepted some subscriptions; and 
when I could not make a go of it due a 
big overhead— office, printers, phone bills 
clerk, postage, etc., and the subscription 
and ad money not turned in by solicitors 
— naturally, I had to discontinue the 
publication. But it was an honest mistake, 
as any fair-minded man can see. And 
even at that, as I look a while back, I can 
say that there was no harm done to any- 
one — except to myself, myself alone. For 
most of the subscriptions then were on 
crc d\l — with most every "subscriber" hesi- 
tating ro send in 1ms remittance 'until 
the next issue,* 5 for fear that next issue 
might no i come out^- which, of course, 
could not come out on the will-pay-you- 
next-timc basis. Even Hearst, McFadden, 
Faweett could not surmount that handi- 
cap in their tyro days of publishing. 

My publication at that time was The 
Filipino Youth. When I went ahead with 
the P A OBSERVER, I had my lessons 
and I was careful; I did not solicit sub- 
scriptions and refused to accept any, as 
already stated above. That is why the 
OBSERVER comes to Stockton with a 
clean slate. 

This time subscriptions are in order. 
The P A OBSERVER is here to stay. It 
is hoped that those who would like to 
subscribe would not put it off day after 
day but send it in at the first convenience 
they have, thus helping this magazine 
perform its unselfish service to the Fihpj. 
nos as well as to their numerous friends 
and sympathizers among Americans and 
those of the Allied Nations, 

Needless to say, the P-A OBSERVER 
is 100 per cent in support of Uncle Sam's 
war program, fully convinced that Presi^ 
dent Roosevelt and his War Cabinet are 
steering the wheel to ultimate Victory. 
Then "the lights will go on again all over 
the world"! 

So long, folks — "See you in Manila!"

LET US SEE 
THESE BEAUTIFUL 
ISLES ...... 

And Scenic Trips 
And Films 

Beautiful Pagsanjan, 
Province of Laguna, 
A Typical Philippine Town, 




Now that the Philippines is well on its way to deliverance from the bloody hands 
of the Japanese, ic is but proper and timely that the Americans should know about the 
unusual beauty with which nature has endowed those lovely isles of the Eastern Seas — 
lovely isles that compose the Beautiful Philippines. 



To many who read this, it shall 
be given to learn somewhat of the 
loveliness of the Islands in the films, 
True, the cunning thief, the camera, 
has filched from Nature but little 
of the secret of her colors. But 
even so, the films will tell more 
than dull print can ever hope to 
portray. And with imagination- 
perchance those so favored will 
think, when they leave the cine, 
they have seen the Philippines. 

Seen, they may have, but did 
they sense the magic of her? They 
tell of the "Call of the East," of 
the witchery of the Tropics. Let 
them come to the Philippines and 
they shall feel the power of the 
double enchantment, for a tropic 
and an eastern sorceress both is 
Filipinas. 

Just when does she begin to 
murmur the charm that draws the 
stranger from other lands to her? 
Answer, you who have felt her 
spell. Was her very name enough? 
Did some faint whisper come to 
your inner ear that day the captain 
registered 'Tropics" in his white 
uniform and the passengers butter- 
flic d forth at the signal from their 
sober, temperate zone chrysalises? 
Or was it when the Southern Cross 
lifted above the horizon or later, 
when the enraptured gaze turned 
from the moon's resplendent track 
across the waves to watch the phos-

phorescence shimmer away from 
the vessel's* forefoot? Was it the 
gorgeous sunsets, rose and crim- 
soned broidered with gold, suffus- 
ing the azure and white of the sky 
above, tinging the violet and green 
of sea; dissolving into purples, 
greys, darker and darker, to be 
shrouded at last in the cloak of 
night: and the sunrises reversing 
the miracle of celestial splendor 
that no human speech, nor brush, 
can ever depict, that wiled you? 
Or did the angry lightnings from 
Filipinas' eyes entice while they 
bade you beware? 

The morning breeze springs up 
— a caress, no more — and the 
palm-lined shores with their vil- 
lages clustering about some grey 
old church and white convent 
grow distinct; the coral atolls 
where the still waters are green as 
a pale emerald, the flying fish skim- 
ming over the glittering ocean. dis~ 
tract the attention from the purple 
haze of mountains deep shaded 
with mighty forests. At last Cor- 
rcgidor, stalwart sentinel at the 
wide harbor's mouth, the watclv 
dogs b Fraile and El Carabao at 
his heels, steps into view. Down 
^ebay.amid the shipping of many 
JJtioiis. glides the steamer, and the 
launches of the customs and quar- 
antine nose out to sniff the stranger 
over. 7 he Faro I a comes 



then the grizzled old swashbuckler, 
Fort Santiago, with his plain, but 
so serviceable, American hat — the 
headquarters of the U. S. Army in 
the Philippines. 

They named Manila the Pearl of 
the Orient, for in the East abound 
the pearl clusters, the richest of its 
imagery for all that is pure and 
precious, lovely and beloved. But a 
ruby she is when the flame flowers 
of the fire-trees crown her, an em- 
erald for her perpetual green, a 
turquoise for her skies: all the jew- 
els, she and the rest of the Philip- 
pines with her. She is so colorful 
— the very 'White Wings 11 on the 
Bagumbayan tone is as to their 
nether garments with the camias 
and hybiscus and the fire-trees. The 
everyday clothes of the populace 
titillate the color sense and when 
there is a procession or other festiv- 
ity the effect is heady like wine.

and tender: all the blues: yellow, 
orange, champaca : every hue, 
shade and tint Art has borrowed

THE PHI LI PPIN E-AMERICAN OBSERVER 



OSMEM PAYS TRIBUTE TO QUEZON 

Sergio Osmcna, President of the Philippines, in his first broadcast 
after taking the presidential oath of office paid fitting tribute to his life- 
Jong friend, the late President Manuel L. Quezon. President Osmena, 
speaking on the March of Time program Thursday, August 3, over the 
National Broadcasting Company's coast-to-coast hook up, said: "The 
story of Manuel L. Quezon's life is the story of a people who love 
freedom and are ready to sacrifice for it. He is not really dead/" the 



President continued, "He lives in 
the heart of eighteen million Fili- 
pinos, and in that of every man 
who loves freedom/' 

Full text of President Osmena's 
broadcast follows; 

"Manuel L. Quezon's fighting 
heart ceased to beat at 10:05 last 
Tuesday morning. He died in 
Saranac Lake, New York, after a 
gallant fight against a pulmonary 
disease that had been sapping his 
vitality away these many years. 
Courageous to the end, he spoke 
the night before of how he would 
return to his beloved Philippines. 
His optimism was enhanced by the 
landings on Numfoor Island six 
hundred miles from the Philippines 
and the attacks on Halmahera and 
Palau by forces under General Mac- 
Arthur and Admiral Nirmtz. 

"The story of Manuel L. Que- 
zon's life is the story of a people 
who love freedom and are ready to 
sacrifice for it. It is also the story 
of Filipino loyalty to America and 
the ideals for which America 
stands, Quezon rose in popular 
esteem and received more evidences 
of his people's confidence and trust 
than any countryman of his as he 
grew to be more and more the 
symbol of the Filipino struggle for 
independence. At the same time, he 
maintained his leadership because 
the Filipino nation knew he had 
an abiding faith in the sense of 
fairness and justice of the American 
people, and that when the crucial 
test came, his loyalty to America 
would not be found wanting. 

'The test came in the First 
World War, when soon after 
America joined the war, Manuel L. 
Quezon, as President of the Senate, 
on behalf of his people offered to 
President Wilson a division of Fili- 
pinos, 25,000 strong, to fight for 
America on the battlefields of Eu- 
rope. The test came again in the 
second World War when after the 
treacherous attack on Pearl Harbor, 
be led his people to fight by the 
side of America, and he himself sick 



as he was, joined General Mac- 
Arthur in Corregidor. 

"It is a real tragedy that we 
should lose him now. The forces 
of victory are on the march every- 
where, in Normandy, in Poland, in 
Italy; the German defenses are 
crumbling down and the United 
Nations are advancing on every 
front. In the Pacific, with Saipan 
and Tinian taken, with Guam prac- 
tically in American hands, with the 
B-29's. America's super- fortresses 
engaged in destroying Japanese 
production centers, with our be- 



loved General MacArthur hammer- 
ing at Japanese outposts three hun- 
dred miles off rhe Philippines- wirh 
the United States Navy in the 
Pacific converted into the most 
powerful fleet now sailing the seven 
seas, we are definitely on our way 
back to the Philippines. How 
tragic, indeed, that he whose every 
dream was to see the complete lib- 
eration of his country should pass 
away now when the dawn of free- 
dom is abour to break for his 
people! 

"We will miss him. and in miss- 
ing him, his memory will be our 
inspiration to continue in the path 
he has set out for us. He is not 
really dead. He lives in the heart of 
eighteen million Filipinos, and in 
that of every man who loves free- 
dom. Another name has been added 
to the list of immortals — Manuel 
L« Quezon.'"

A HUMAN CREED 

I live for those who love me, For the cause that lacks assistance; 

For those who know me true, For the wrong that needs resistance; 

For the heaven that smiles above me, For the future in the distance. 

And awaits my spirit, too; And the good that I can do.

FOOD CAMPAIGN FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES 



The most imperative need of the people of the 
Philippines when its repossession by the American- 
Philippine forces takes place is food. The time to 
garner foodstuffs is NOW. 

In an interview with President Sergio Osmena at 
his office in Washington, last August, the chief execu- 
tive was emphatic in pointing to food as the nrst 
essential need of the Americans and Filipinos in the 
Philippines the day General Douglas MacArthur and 
his Filipino-American forces return there. 

"There are three things that are badly needed by 
ir nonnl«> u,^v u~~,„ " D„>c;^nr Osmena said, ana 



, The Japanese, in their forced dorninat ion of he 
Islands, provide themselves with all the food t ««J" 
able there. And they send foodstuffs from «W 
Pines to the Japanese mainland, and to their fighting 
men in Manchuria. China, Thailand, Burma ; and tm 
Southwest Pacific. And the main foodstuff they lake 
and send out is — Rice 

Rice is also the staple food of the H^f** Kjg 
cultivation the native farmer has an '"^"^ * 
an.mal for his help - the Carabao. The Carabao is 
used in plowing and harrowing the nee fields. 

during the - Batt , e of the Philippines" tb | s *"'™ s 
was practically wiped out; and whatever ^rabao r 
left ahve was taken away from the nauve fa rt n etoy 
the enemy. Deprived of this Old Faithful, this 



"Old Reliable/' the Filipino farmer is badly handi- 
capped in the production of this staple product; and 
thus is the scarcity of rice felt more badly now than 
ever before in the history of the Islands. 

THE OBSERVER appeals to all Filipinos in the 
United States, and to their American cousins, to start 
a Drive — NOW — for the acquisition of rice to be 
provided to the destitute people of the Philippines 
when invasion is at hand. 

ft suggests that Filipinos in their respective com- 
munities elect trustworthy men and women to a 
special "Rice Campaign Committee"' whose function 
will be to encourage their countrymen to donate at 
least one sack of rice; to provide a safe storehouse to 
keep this foodstuff until ready for shipment to the 
Philippines; and to devise ways and means to acquire, 
after rice, other foodstuffs such as those aforemen- 
tioned in this editorial. 

(Warning to opportunists and racketeers: If you want to 
get in on this human and patriotic movement, help and give 
— instead of help and fill your pockets*) 

The Observer also suggests to rice dealers to sell 
at cost price, if possible, or at the least profit, after 
verifying that the rice order is not for the personal 
use of the buyer or his friends here, but specifically for 
those in the Philippines; and said order to be delivered 
directly to the storehouse so designated. 

Let us start this Rice Campaign NOW, And when 
invasion comes we shall have plenty of it to ship to 
our dear people in the Philippines.

businessman And rice dealer offers 900 or so sacks of rice be has 
at cost price.)

Quezon, The Apostle of 
Phil ippine Nationalism 

By Diosdado M, Yap 

Editor and Publisher, "Batasn"* Magazine 



When Manuel Luis Quezon, president of the Philippine government- 
in-exile, died on August t f 1944, a career ended that stretched from a 
tbatched-roof hut in the remote Luzon village of Baler to the mahogany 
halls of Malacanang Palace in Manila. He died peacefully after a long 
siege of illness hardly the kind of death his adventurous life forecast. 

Few Americans who read of Quezon's death realized chat one of the 
great champions of liberty, one of the few men who became a part of his 
people and his people a part of him, had passed away from the earth. 
Quezon was known in the capitals of the world, but few of the plain 
of the earth, outside his 



in 

to 



people 

native Philippines, knew of his 
colorful life or had heard of his 
dynamic speeches. Away from his 
native land, he maintained a reserve 
befitting the leader of a free people. 

Although in virtual retirement 
and half-hidden from the public 
prints by the news of the global 
war Quezon's last days were filled 
with as many expressions burning 
with a love of liberty as were those 
he echoed through the mountains 
of the Philippine back-country 
when he fought fox freedom from 
the Americans at the side of Gen- 
eral EmiUo Aguinaldo, the spiritual 
heir of Dr. Jose Risal, whose writ- 
ings still inspire modern scholars. 

News of his death saddened tens 
of thousands of Filipinos 
America, who were preparing 
drink toasts to his health on August 
19 when he would have been 66 
« rt M The Office of War In- 
KSaSon. which had placed to

« of his death. The news 
„hr qidness to the chancelleries 
S°ev?y m-ber of the United Na- 
°? L / nr while he was a stranger 

places of the world. 

ft is likely that no man living in 
the world today has won as many 

liriril battles and has held a peo- 
P ? 1 « much in the hollow of his 
&d for iost 40 years as had 
urUin little man with the pam- 
tb %k df e, who conquered tuber-

t 



been in 



in the Philippines longer than the 
leader of any representative govern- 
ment on earth and he accomplished 
this remarkable record in a country 
made up of 7,09 I islands, with as 
many political viewpoints, cus- 
toms, religions and folkways. To 
learn how he was able to win elec- 
tion after election, although faced 
with powerful and well-financed 
enemies, would make an interesting 
project for political scientists, and 
were any American politician to 
learn exactly how Quezon held the 
loyalty of most of the voters so 
long, it is doubtful that 10 terms 
would be too much for him to ask. 

He never lost a political battle, 
from the time he became "fiscal/' a 
post corresponding to that of jus- 
tice of the peace in this country, 
until death claimed him. His poli- 
tical career was so closely inter- 
twined with the political history 
and improvements of the Philip- 
pines that a list of his "firsts" neces- 
sitates the listing of the dates of the 
beginning of every important new 
step toward freedom taken by his 
native land since the end of the 
! hihppine insurrection. 

He was elected first floor leader 
of the first Filipino Assembly in 

He was elected first President of 
the first Filipino Senate, organized 
in 1 9 1 6, 

He was elected first President of 
the Commonwealth of the Philip- 
pines, November 15, 1935. 

When it was recognized in No- 

St?* t 9 | 4 A that no elections 
cou d be held for President of the 
miippme Commonwealth and al- 

Er ded ^ i n ° P * s «fcnt should 
serve more than eight years, the 



MANUEL LUIS QUEZON 

Congress of the United States, for 
the first time in its history, voted 
to set aside a written constitution 
and to continue Quezon as Presi- 
dent of the Philippines until such 
time as elections could be held in 
the islands, Sergio Osmena, vice 
president of the government-in- 
cxile, who acceded to the presidency 
on the death of Quezon, acquiesced 
in this proposal. 

So far as is known, the first two 
Americans ever to see Quezon and 
to give him more than passing no- 
tice were two soldiers of the Ameri- 
can Expeditionary Force in the 
Philippines who captured him on 
a hot day in August in the little 
mountain town of Mariveles, A 
short, sply, handsome little man, 
he was dressed in a rather nonde- 
script uniform when he was cap- 
tured by Lieutenant Lawrence S. 
Miller and Private Roy Squires, 
who immediately gave him his free- 
dom under the general amnesty 
then being offered all insurrection- 
ists who would surrender peace- 
fully and take an oath of allegiance 
to the American flag. 

In his later life, Quezon was to 
become known as something of a 
dandy i n political circles the world 
oyer, but there was little to indicate 
his future sartorial perfection the 
day he became an American subject. 

Quezon had given up for a pur- 
pose. He immediately went to 
Manila to verify whether or not 
General Aquinaldo really had been 

un tUrL>d ' as had been rumored - 
when he learned that this was true 



PAGE 6 



THE 



PHILJPPINE-A1V1ERICAN OBSERVER 



and transmitted the news back to 
the remaining Filipino forces, the 
revolution quickly dissolved, 

StiU of college age, Quezon re- 
turned to law school in Manila, 
where he had received his high 
school and college education in a 
Catholic academy, after having 
mastered his elementary education 
by studying under his own father, 
a poor school-teacher In Baler. 
Earlier, in high school, Quezon had 
earned the nickname of "the big 
windbag" because of his propensity 
for oratory, but no one called bim 
that when he came back from the 
wars- He had worked himself up 
from an infantry lieutenant to a 
major during two years of guerilla 
warfare under General Aguinaldo. 

By coincidence, he and Sergio 
Osmena, his successor, were class- 
mates at Santo Tomas University, 
where both received their law de- 
gree in 1903. Osmena was second 
scholar in the class, while Quezon 
was among the highest ten in the 
final exams. Their names were first 
linked on the final class roll, with 
Osmena being listed alphabetically 
as No. 282 and Quezon as No. 
283. The two leaders, who fought 
and worked together for 40 years, 
were not at all alike physically or 
temperamentally. Quezon was 
more of the Spanish type, open- 
hearted and sagacious, while Os- 
mena, who has Chinese blood, is 
more circumspect in disposition. 

In the early days of their politi- 
cal life, Osmena seemed to be forg- 
ing ahead and it was he who saw 
to it that Quezon was appointed 
Resident Commissioner in Wash- 
ington, where Quezon served from 
May 15, 1 909, to January, 1917, 
staying so long that many political 
observers in the islands thought 
that he had lost the admiration and 
affection of his people* 

However, as usual, Quezon's 
showmanship made him the man 
of the hour on his return. When 
he returned to the islands, it was in 
company with the new Governor- 
General, Francis Burton Harrison, 
former Congressman from New 
York and noted Tammany leader. 
When President Wilson was con- 
sidering whom to appoint Gover- 
nor-General, it was agreed that 
Harrison could name the new ap- 
pointee but that he should consult 
with Quezon. When Harrison 
went to Quezon, the latter replied: 
"Why could you not become the 
Governor-General yourself?" Later, 
Harrison agreed to take the post 
and, when he arrived at the islands, 



he gave Quezon the credit for his 
appointment. 

The fact that Harrison proved 
to be the most ardent advocate of 
the doctrine, "the Philippines for 
Filipinos," added to the fact that 
he admitted he owed his appoint- 
ment to Quezon, made the latter 
the popular hero in the islands, 
Back in Washington, Quezon con- 
tinued his fight for new concessions 
fox the Philippines and was re- 
warded with the so-called Jones 
Law, which made provision for a 
Senate in the Philippines. When he 
stood for election to this body, be 
was elected by an overwhelming 
vote, and the new Senate, in turn 
made him its first president, the 
highest office in the land at .the 
time. 

Known as a "ladies' man/' Que- 
zon was looked upon as a confirmed 
bachelor until, in December, 1918, 
he and a cousin, Miss Aurora 
Aragon, were married in Hong- 
kong. They honeymooned in 
America. The union was blessed 
with three children, all still living. 
They are Maria Aurora and Maria 
Zenaida and Manuel Luis Quezon 
Jr., who were at his bedside with 
their mother when the "star ol 
Baler" passed into the Great be- 
yond. 

While there is not the slightest 
reason to believe that Quezon had 
the slightest reservation when he 
rook the oath of allegiance to the 
American flag on his capture in 
1903 every move that he made 
thereafter was spurred by a thought 
he expressed in a famous line from 
one of his speeches: 

"I prefer a government run like 
hell by Filipinos to a government 
run like heaven by Americans. 

Since the first political race in 
which he engaged, when he run on 
an "immediate independence 
Ink Quezon did everything in 
his moral and legal power to pro- 
moted independence of his nation 
by peac ful means. On more than 
oL P occasion f his political enemies 
no need out to him that no nation 
Over bad attained vndependenc 
ronioletely without bloodshed, but 
ffXS ^ways to the hope that 
A m enca g wouId let go of the islands 
before his death. 

He died with this hope fulfilled, 
for only two months before his 

CnSn Sn, the islands and 



the military authorities had de- 
clared the area safe. Until this reso- 
lution passed, unanimously, the 
law then in effect would have given 
the Philippines freedom on July 4, 
1946. 

Noted for his ability to 'play 
poker," either actually or in politi- 
cal hide-and-seek, Quezon was a 
natural mixer. Ready of wit and 
quick on the come-back, his extem- 
poraneous remarks on the political 
platform in the Philippines made 
bim famous, but feared by rivals. 
On the occasion of the first conven- 
ing of the Filipino Assembly in 
1907, at which he was named floor 
leader, Quezon was the first Fili- 
pino to speak. When William 
Howard Taft, then Secretary of 
War, failed to put in an appearance 
to preside at the first working ses- 
sion of the Assembly. Quezon arose 
and said: 

"It seems to me, gentlemen of 
the assembly, that the hour has 
come for us to begin our task. We 
have not opened the session until 
now, in the belief that the Honor- 
able Secretary of War would come 
to preside over the Assembly unril 
the Speaker shall have been duly 
elected, but since he has not come, I 
propose that in accordance with our 
agreement arrived at in the prelimi- 
nary sessions, and in conformity 
with the established practice, in the 
Congress of the United States, the 
session should now be opened in 
order that we can proceed with the 
election of the Speaker 

That was 37 years ago and Os- 
mena, the same Osmena who now 
succeeds Quezon, seconded the mo- 
tion, Osmena a few minutes later 
was named speaker and Quezon 
was elected by acclamation as floor 
leader. 

It was only a year later that 
Quezon began the world tours that 
were to make him famous in the 
Philippines and known in every 
capital in the world. With two 
other members of the new Assem- 
bly, he went to St, Petersburg to 
attend the International Naviga- 
tion Conference, but they arrived 
just as the conference broke up, 

Nothing daunted, Quezon spent 
every penny of the 34,000 pesos 
voted for his traveling expenses, 
coming home by way of Washing- 
ton, where he breakfasted with 
President Theodore Roosevelt and 
came away with a spoken promise 
of the President that the Philip- 
pines would be completely inde- 
pendent within 20 years. 

Few political leaders have with- 



OCTOBER, 1944

stood the sicknesses that have 
plagued Quezon through the years 
and continued to hold the reins of 
power/ First stricken with tuber- 
culosis in 1927. Quezon spent 
many months in a Southern Call- 
forma sanatorium and recovered, 
although he left his sick-bed at one 
time-in an effort to influence some 
Philippine legislation then before 
the Senate. In 1934 r while on a 
world tour, he was stricken with 
kidney stones and underwent an 
operation at Johns-Hopkins Hos^ 
pita! in Baltimore. He was stricken 
with a later attack of tuberculosis 
even before he left the Philippines 
in the spring of 1942 with General 
Douglas MacArthur, whom he had 
known since they were youths in 
Manila. 

The philosophical manner in 
which he took his bodily pains is 
best illustrated by what he told the 
nurses at Johns-Hopkins when he 
was awaiting the operation there: 

"When I left Manila, the doctor 
warned me not to take anything 
alcoholic; but when I went to Java, 
a specialist told me it did not matter 
to take a glass or two of beer. A 
specialist in Paris told me that beer 
was no good, but that I could take 
liquor and wine. Therefore, until 
my arrival in America, I drank 
liberally of champagne every day. 
Then I consulted a specialist in 
America and he told me not to 
drink champagne, but that I could 
drink whiskey. Every country 
seems to have its own way of treat- 
ment for kidney stones. I do not 
know which is right, but this time 
I will drink to the health of the 
American doctor and take the medi- 
cine that he prepares." 

Many are the tributes that have 
been paid to the little man who 
died far away from the native 
islands he loved. On one occasion, 
Roy W. Howard said that Quezon 
was one of the six greatest states- 
men in the world. Kings and pre- 
miers had honored him with their 
plaudits and every journalist of 
note who has visited the Philip- 
pines since 1900 had met Quezon. 

When a visiting Japanese jour- 
nalist in 1935 asked Quezon if the 
Philippines would recognize the 
independence of Manchoukuo t 
Quezon replied: "Well, by the 
lime we are really independent I 
shall be too old, I am afraid. At 
any rate, before the Common- 
wealth of the Philippines recog- 
nizes Manchoukuo, Japan has to 
recognize the independence of the

T HE PHILIPPINE AMERICAN OBSERVER 




A PROGRAM 
FOR UNITY 



By Carlos Bulosan 



Contrary to some beliefs, our 
people on the West Coast look to- 
ward the government and President 
Osmcna for guidance. Since the 
Nationals Division of the office of 
the Resident Commissioner, and 
now directly under the Common- 
wealth Government- in-exile, is in- 
effective, I suggest that a Research 
Committee should be formed to 
study the problems of our people. 
Such a committee should be ex- 
tended to Hawaii where hundreds 
of Filipinos, both first and second 
generations, are in great need of an 
intelligent program initiated by the 
government. There are expert Fili- 
pino writers, journalists, research 
workers and scholars who are will- 
ing to contribute their talents in 
the service of the government. This 
project should not cost the govern- 
ment too much money because a 
committee of five is enough. To 
avoid unnecessary delays and mis- 
understandings, I would like to 
recommend trained Filipino na- 
tionals to be in the committee. 

I believe that Col. Carlos P. 
Romulo's visit in California helped 
simplify our complex problems. 
His visit undoubtedly regained 
the confidence of our countrymen 
in our leaders and government. In 
the past, various agencies and lead- 
ers of the government divorced 
themselves from the people, The 
new policy of the government, that 
is, its sincere efforts to reach the 
Filipino population in the United 
States, especially in the State of 
California, is of great significance 
to us as a minority group desiring 
the fullest recognition that belongs 
to our people. In this connection, 
I would like to state that it was 
President Quezon who made it pos- 
sible for Col. Romulo to visit Cali- 
fornia. This far-sighted and intel- 
ligent move helped make our people 
understand, and cooperate with, 
the government's new policies. 

We speak about rehabilitation in 
the Philippines, but we have for- 
gotten that the issue also effects our 
people here. What plans have we 



for the first generation Filipinos 
who are not in the armed forces? 
There is the question of citizenship. 
A nation-wide campaign embracing 
both Americans and Filipinos 
should be started for those who like 
4.0 become naturalized American 
citizens. This should not put our 
government into embarrassment, in 
the name of nationalism, because 
citizenship in America is a symbol 
of democracy. In our case, how- 
ever, it is a recognition of our heroic 
stand in Bataan and our sincere co- 
operation with the United States 
in defense of democracy. 

Now there is the problem of the 
second generarion Filipinos, They 
are totally ignorant of their country 
and people, I suggest that we 
should Fiiipinize them, that is f get 
them acquainted with the great his- 
tory of the Philippines and some 
of our leaders that founded our 
great tradition to hate tyranny. In 
a sense this will coincide with their 
Americanization, for this country's 
tradition and the spirit behind it is 
similar to ours, and the intelligent 
blending of the two traditions will 
create a fully integrated individual. 
In relation to this idea, a brief his- 
tory of the Philippines should be 
prepared for these children under 
government expense. I am thinking 
of a book tracing the growth of 
democracy in the Philippines. 

In this conection, also, a brief 
book about ten Filipino leaders 
should be written to supplement 
the history book. Bur the most ef- 
fective educational book is a brief 
biography of President Quezon, 
The book must be written by a 
Filipino who has a deep awareness 
of the history of our country and 
our leaders who had bequeathed us 
an intelligent nationalism, The 
story of the life of President Que- 
zon is the history of our country in 
our time: the slow and painful rise 
of our people from tyranny and 
backwardness to literacy and de- 
mocracy. President Quezon con- 
figurates our undying struggle for 
liberty. 



What about the Filipinos in the 
armed forces? Here, again, is a deli- 
cate problem. What definite plans 
have we for those who are fighting 
the war in the batrlefronts, 1 be- 
lieve it is not too late to formulate 
a program for them. Such a pro- 
gram should include their families 
for any program that does not af- 
fect them is futile. The returning 
soldiers will have a dynamic place 
in Philippine life and politics. That 
is something we must guard against 
because some reactionary groups 
might use them for the destruction 
of democratic gains in our country. 

Is it necessary to create a depart- 
ment of labor in our government? 
The Western Division of the Office 
of the Resident Commissioner is 
inadequate, say, is useless to the 
Filipinos on the West Coast for its 
approaches are merely diplomatic. 
It is not necessary, however, to cre- 
ate a new department if the Na- 
tionals Division in California 
broadens its work and makes its 
approaches to Filipino problems 
more realistic, 

If such a department in our gov- 
ernment is created, who is the man 
to represent it? Incidentally, a 
Washington lawyer and his satel- 
lite in California arc coming closer 
to the Filipinos, This is one thing 
that our officials in the Nationals 
Division overlooked: they neglected 
the importance of personal contact 
with our common people. 

What about our Nationals Di- 
vision? As far as I am concerned, 
this department of the government 
has yet to prove itself adequate for 
the needs of the Filipinos, There is 
ample time for renovation and exe- 
cution of responsibilities. 

I understand that a Filipino poet 
and a musician are receiving pen- 
sions from the government. In the 
future, however, I hope this coveted 
grant should be extended to others 
in the various branches of educa- 
tion and the arts. 

In political warfare the most 
alert and sensitive talents should be 
utilized. It is only in using the col- 
lective genius of our people that we 
can withstand the onslaught of 
barbarism, The post war world 
will be chaotic, but there is enough 
rime for preparation. 

These are the problems of Fili- 
pinos in the United States. Presi- 
Osmena, through Commissioner 
Romulo, will answer them and 
then, after they are discussed with 
our people in California, the gov- 
ernment will establish a realist u 
program.

Romulo Addresses Congress 

New Commissioners Delivery of First Address Before August Body 
Timed for 28th Anniversary of Passage of Jones Act 

CoL Carlos P. Romulo, Resident Commissioner of the Philippines to 
the U, S., delivered his first address on the floor of Congress last August 
29, the 28th anniversary of the passage of the Jones Act. 

Following is full text of Commissioner Romulo's address — 



THE JONES ACT — FOUNDA- 
TION STONE OF BATAAN: 
"Mr, Speaker. 

' Twenty -eight years ago today, 
upon this floor, America gave its 
first pledge of freedom to the peo- 
ple of the Philippines. 

"On that day the Congress of 
the United States approved the 
Jones Act, promising independence 
to the subject Philippines in a 
covenant that is without parallel 
in the world's history, 

"It is not my purpose to review 
the Filipinos' fight against Amer- 
ica during the early days of Ameri- 
can occupation, nor stress the fact 
that it took the United States three 
and one-half years of actual fighi> 
ing to subdue the Philippines, We 
were not conquered, in the final 
analysis, by guns, but by the prac- 
tical demonstration in the Philip- 
pines of America's concept of 
democracy, American teachers 
brought us new methods. Public 
health, road building, government 
training — such things were given 
us. Gradually our feeling toward 
America changed from resentment 
and suspicion to confidence and 
loyalty. 

'That loyalty was sealed by the 
passage of the Jones Act, 

"The long struggle for Philip- 
pine Independence that was to cul- 
minate in the passage of the Jones 
Act was waged upon this floor. It 
was a strange struggle, carried on in 
amity and understanding, for only 
Americans could comprehend the 
democratic dreams of our Filipino 
leaders. There were two of these 
fiery young nationalists who began 
the fight for independence, Manuel 
Luis Quezon, as Resident Com- 
missioner, on this floor, set here the 
demands for the outposts of democ- 
racy in the Philippines, laid here 
the foundation of Bataan. But it 
was in the Philippines where the 
strategy of the whole fight was 
planned under Sergio Osmena, 
Speaker of the Philippine Assem- 
bly, who, as the then leader of the 
Filipino people, gave purpose and 



page 12 



direction to the peaceful campaign 
for freedom. 

"The first Philippine Assembly 
that convened on October 16, 
1907, was the supreme test of our 
ability to govern ourselves. If it 
succeeded, more self-governing 
powers would be awarded the Fili- 
pinos, If it failed, it would mean 
a set-back in our slow march to 
independence. Those who made 
the Philippine Assembly a success 
were men of courage and vision, 
and our Philippine democracy be- 
came the monument to their strug- 
gle and their sacrifice, I would like 
to call their roll today, yet however 
long and glorious the list, we must 
come to one name at last, that of 



the new President of the Common- 
wealth of the Philippines, Sergio 
Osmena. As Speaker of that his- 
toric Assembly, he united its vari- 
ous elements and steered its course, 
establishing for the first time the 
policy of Filipino collaboration 
with America. He Jed us then 
through a crucial period in our his- 
tory, to emerge triumphant in the 
test that resulted in the recognition, 
through the Jones Act, of our 
capacity for self-government and 
freedom. He is leading us today, as 
President in exile, through darker 
days of travail, and the crowning 
service of this patient and self- 
effacing statesman will be to estab- 
lish after victory has been achieved, 
the Philippine Republic. 

'The Jones Act, approved on 
August 29, 1916, placed the legis- 
lative power in Filipino hands. It 
provided for the creation of the 
Philippine Senate to be elected by 
the people and to be composed en- 
tirely of Filipinos. It gave the first 
glimpse of democracy to the be- 
knighted Far East at our back, to 
millions of enslaved Asiatics. The 
American name of Jones carried to

the Far East America's words that 
had hammered the year 1776 into 
history — independence and equal- 
ity. It was a vested interest in the 
future that must assure economic 
and spiritual decency for all men. 

"I would like to call attention 
to the fact that on exactly that 
same date six years before, on 
August 29 t 1910 t Japan against 
the will of the Koreans, formally 
annexed the ancient kingdom of 
Korea and ended its independent 
existence of 4200 years! 

"What curious coincidence could 
better show the contrast in ideol- 
ogy between the United States and 
Japan. These two historical inci- 
dents reveal why Japan and Amer- 
ica are now at war. With the an- 
nexation of Korea, Japan started 
on its blood-stained march of con- 
quest that was to culminate in the 
sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, while 
America, with the Jones Act, set a 
course of freedom and democracy 
for all peoples. 

"The Jones Act was our victory. 
You let us win it upon this floor. 
It was a pledge made, and America 
has kept that pledge. In 1934 the 
Tydings-McDuffie Act set the in- 
dependence date, for July 4, 1946. 
Recently, Congress passed S. J. 
Resolution No. 93 advancing the 
date of independence as soon as the 
Japanese invader is driven from 
Philippine soil and constitutional 
processes are restored in the Philip- 
pines. 

"We too kept the pledge. You 
gave us the Jones Act, We gave you 
Balaam For Bataan and Corregi- 
dor were dividends paid back out 
of our loyalty and our faith in 
America. On this day, twenty- 
eight years ago, we of the Philip- 
pines were promised a place beside 
our fellow Americans as men equal

and free. We earned that position 
in 1941 r when we offered our lives 
beside Americans, in the blackest 
hour America has known. 

"Bataan, where Filipinos fought 
under the American flag to preserve 
democracy, was the ultimate out- 
post of freedom in the Far East. 

"Half the world lies between the 
foxholes of Bataan and the floor of 
Congress, and yet I cannot feel my- 
self a stranger among the repre- 
sentatives of a people for whose flag 
and ideals my countrymen did not 
hesitate to fight and die. I speak 
for them, a nation of prisoners, 
their tongues stopped with fear or 
with death, because they cast their 
lot with Americans, against their 
'fellow Orientals/ the Japanese. 

"I speak for them proudly, sev- 
enteen million of them, with new 
hope, for at last we see the way 
clear back to the Philippines, and 
we dare to speak of victory. 

"We know now there will be 
victory, and palms such as are laid 
on the graves of Arlington will be 
placed on the nameless dust of 
Bataan. On that bloodstained 
Philippine peninsula Americans and 
Filipinos must meet over a common 
grave where lie the bodies of their 
sons. We will remember then, af- 
ter victory, how we valued them, 
those American and Filipino boys 
who died together for democracy, 
In our eyes they were beautiful, 
they were the hope of our lives, and 
our hearts will break again over 
their shared dust. 

"We will meet, my fellow 
Americans, over the common grave, 
"Out of that grave, a dream, 

"Others have died for that dream 
of world recognition of the ordi- 
nary civilians and the divine rights 
of man, 



"A Jew named Christ carried 
that dream, via Golgotha, to a hill 
that is known as Calvary. 

"An American, Abraham Lin- 
coln, carried that dream from a log 
cabin to the White House. He was 
assassinated, here in Washington. 

"The Filipino, Manuel Quezon, 
died for that dream, after taking 
his last stand for democracy in the 
tunnel on Corregidor. 

"And a boy named Jose, from 
Manila, and another boy named 
Joe, from Missouri, died for the 
same dream on Bataan, and their 
commingled dust is holy earth. 

"How can we sift that dust by 
race for separate honor! Both were 
young. Both loved life. But they 
hated autocracy more than they 
loved lving, and they share one 
grave on Bataan. 

"Out of that grave, a dream, 
'Bloom forever, oh Republic, from 
the dust of thy bosom!"

the colorfulness is worth going 
around the world to see. 

And how the mixture of cen- 
turies and lands intrigues the inter- 
est. The architecture! It includes 
splendid examples of the Grecian, 
Moorish, seventeenth-century Span- 
ish, Renaissance, Gothic and By- 
zantine, The Seven Lamps shone 
over the drawing boards of famous 
builders, lay and secular, to whom 
Manila owes her many fine edifices. 
Fray Herrera, son of him who de- 
signed the Escorial, built St, Au- 
gustine's. The little naive, native 
huts — was he who conceived their 
plan of more celebrated lineage still 
— Adam himself? The atrocities in 
rows common to every city, who 
fathered them ? The costumes: Old 
Spain gave the peasant's neckerchief 
that has evolved into the panueio, 
and the court train of her damas; 
her priests the tapis; the ground 
plan in Malayan, the sleeves swelled 
to suit the climate. This, which 
has changed but little in over three 
centuries, is the predominant model; 
but America, Paris, half Asia and 
the South Pacific contribute also to 
the revue des modes: Georgette 
crepe and coconut fibre rain cape 
and skirt, white duck and rengue, 
all in the same rain shower on the 
same block. The shops: Modern- 
ities with plate-glass fronts, office 
buildings with their elevators, el- 
bow in between the open -fronted 
Chino shops of Rosario. And the 
carabao snails by and the "little 
gray hawk" that "hangs aloft in

for the scenery. 

In the provinces around Manila, 
there are various places of more 
than passing picturesqueness, places 
historically and otherwise interest- 
ing, and several resorts noted for 
their medicinal springs and baths. 
Sibul Springs in Bulacan, and Los 
Banos in Laguna, are the principal 
ones. At Sibul, too, is the cave of 
Biaona-bato, where the pact was 
signed that ended the insurrection 
of 1 897. At Los Banos visitors on 
their way to the celebrated falls of 
Pagsanhan and to the falls of Boto- 
can, usually stop to see the town 
and lake and the agricultural college.

Filipino Businessman, 
Washington Visitor 

By Dr. Diosdado M. Yap 
Editor « Publisher, "Bataan" Magazine 




Washington — In the midst of 
extremely hot days in the nation's 
capital, Benito R, Alcantara, prom- 
inent Filipino businessman of 
Stockton, California, came to pay 
his respects to the new officials of 
the Philippine Government-in-exile. 

Alcantra was received by the offi- 
cials and he was very much im- 
pressed by their hospitality. He 
paid his respect to the President, 
Commissioner Carlos P. Romulo, 
Finance Secretary Jaime Hernan- 
dez, Budget and Finance ComrmV 
sioner Ismael Mathay, Nationals 
Division Chief Manuel Adeva and 
others. He also called on the writer. 

Alcantara, after having spent 
several years in various kinds of 
work in the Pacific Coast, since his 
arrival here some fifteen years ago, 
finally established a going business 
which is the pnde of the Filipinos 
in Stockton. He is popularly 
known as a truly civic-minded 
citizen of Stockton and he numbers 
among his friends many American 
officials and businessmen as well. 

Before coming to Washington, 
Alcantara visited several cities in 



B. R. ALCANTARA 

the west and midwest, including 
Salt Lake City, Cheyenne, Chicago, 
Detroit, Montreal, New York and 
Philadelphia. From here he will go 
to New Orleans where he expects 
to make negotiations for purchas- 
ing sea foods for his business in 
Stockton. In the metropolitan cities 
he visited he bought several thou- 
sand dollars worth of dry goods 
and as he indicated humbly, this is 
merely "to meet the urgent de- 
mands of my regular customers in 
the farming camps." 

"When the Philippines are re- 
taken/' Alcantara pointed out, "it 
is my dream to establish business 
in the Islands so as to be of service 
to my countrymen. My sole ambi- 
tion in life is to help our people 
after these years of suffering from 
the Japanese occupation. I hope 
that every Filipino will feel as I do 
about our responsibility to our 
country when this war is over. But 
whatever, my countrymen's plans 
might be, it is my prayer that they 
will redound to the credit of our 
people and country." 

Alcantara expects to arrive in 
Stockton the middle of September

Confidence of American People in Roosevelt Leadership 
Shown in Third Successive Reelection 




PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT 



Although not an overwhelming 
victory as when he defeated Herbert 
Hoover, Alfred Landon and the 
late Wendell Willkie, Franklin 

D. Roosevelt had no difficulty in 
winning over Governor Thomas 

E. Dewey. It was a foregone con- 
clusion to most people, but there 
was hardly anyone who thought it 
would be a walk-away. 

Thus is another history made in 
American politics: a fourth term 
President. Because he is the most 
logical man under the circum- 
stances. If we were not in a crucial 
war like this we could afford to 
change — to Dewey (or "Do we" 
really?) — but conditions being 
what they are the American people 
were sensible enough to make an 
experienced and winning pitcher 
continue pitching a winning game. 



To date (Nov. 10) the total of 
popular votes cast, as reported from 
120,501 out of the country's 
1 30,819 precincts, are 23,915,084 
(432 electoral votes), for Roose- 
velt and 20,976,534 (99 electoral 
votes) for Dewey. 

And here are the complete scores 
of the three previous Presidential 
elections: 1932 — Total vote: 39, 
816,522. Roosevelt, 22,821,857; 
electoral vote 472. Hoover, 15,- 
761,841; electoral vote, 59. 1936 
— Total vote: 45,646, 1 1 7. Roose- 
velt, 27,751,597; electoral vote, 
523. Landon, 16,679,583; elec- 
toral vote, 8. 1940 — Total vote: 
49,815,312. Roosevelt, 27,243,- 
466, electoral vote, 449. Willkie, 
22,304,755; electoral vote, 82. 

By the time the complete returns 
are gathered, which will include the 



servicemen's vote, and are supposed 
to be in by December 6, the total 
votes cast are expected to reach the 
50-million mark. 

We Hail the CHIEF! The Win- 
ner and still Champion! Precedent 
buster, record breaker, history 
maker, indomitable fighter, formid- 
able leader, humanity lover 

Franklin Delano Roosevelt!

Senator Harry S. Truman from 
[Missouri, the new Vice-President- 
elect, was chosen by the Democratic 
moguls to be Roosevelt's running 
mate at the Convention in Chicago 
on the strength of his record as 
creator and chairman of the Tru- 
man Senate Committee. 

Truman has been a member of 
the Senate since 1934. He helped 
draft railroad legislation, authored 
a bill for the federal licensing of op- 
erators of motor vehicles used in 
inter-state traffic and helped draft 
the Civil Aeronautics Act. He was 
a member of the Appropriations 
Committee, the Military Affairs 
Committee, the Interstate Com- 
merce Committee, the Committee 
on Public Buildings and Grounds 
— ^in addition to the Truman Com- 
mittee. 

Vice-President-elect Truman 
was born in Independence, Mo., 60 
years ago. He isn't much of a 
speaker, but his clean public record 
has made him soar the heights in 

his political career.

in California; for he was running 
against an opponent, Lieutenant 
Governor Frederick Houscr, who 
commanded a much stronger sup- 
port than his previous opponents. 

In Los Angeles the anxiety over 
the outcome of Downey's political 
tussle was equalled only by that of 
Helen Gahagan Douglas'. Incum- 
bent Downey was running for re- 
election : Helen Gahagan was mak- 
ing her first try in national politics. 
Sen. Downey's Republican foe, Lt. 
Gov. Houser, was also throwing 
his hat in the national political 
ring for the first time. Both Mrs. 
Douglas and Republican Mr. WiL 
ham D. Campbell were "first appli- 
cants." 

Senator Downey has rendered 
valuable service to the Golden State, 
and to the nation in general. As a 
colleague, Senator Joseph O f Ma^ 
honey of Wyoming, said of him, 
he understands the problems of 
the West and of California. He 
has succeeded where many would 
have failed in so impressing himself 
on the United States Senate that he 
was able to obtain authority for a 
Senate investigation of transporta- 
tion and manpower throughout the 
I acific Coast and Rocky Mountain 
otates. 

California can well be proud of 
its equal party representation in 
the highest law-making body of 
the land. Senators Hiram Johnson 
and Sheridan Downey, 



Representative Ciare Boothe

glamorous Helen Gahagan Doug- 
las, Congresswoman-elect from 
California. Both fortyish. both 
talented and quite capable of leader- 
ship. Both were featured speakers 
at the Conventions of their respec- 
tive parties in Chicago last summer. 

Although each of them is mar- 
ried ro a man who has reached the 
top of his profession, each one's 
success has been achieved through 
her own merit — through determi- 
nation, industry and earnestness. 
La Luce was editor, playwright 
and author before she got elected to 
Congress. She still wields the pen.

which Miss Davis wrote for Life, 
she continues: "When some of our 
own G-2's wonder why Mrs. Luce 
got more information than they 
did Clare will say blandly that 
she got no more than any reporter, 
This fools no one.

observing, than most reporters; she 
was a beautiful woman in places

to desert battle fronts — as General 
Ritchie took Clare in Libya — -no

The elections just passed re- 
turned Rep. Luce to Congress from 
the 4th district of Connecticut. She 
won by a plurality of more than 
2,000 votes over her younger op- 
ponent, Miss Margaret Connors, 
Democrat. 

"I never was apprehensive about 
the returns during the evening." she 
told reporters at her one-room 
headquarters in Greenwich, Conn. 
"When Miss Connors was ahead of 
me, she was ahead. When we were 
tied, we were tied. When I was 
ahead, I was ahead, It was a very 
close fight. We won. I wasn't run- 
ning against her, I was running 
against the New Deal up here and 
the PAC"

beauty of the stage and screen a few 
years back. Age and preoccupations 
have not quite subdued' that rare 
gift she possesses. It was a strenu- 
ous campaign fight she waged 
against her Republican opponent, 
William D. Campbell, of the 14th 
district, in the heart of ,the city of 
Los Angeles: but she won, by a 
much bigger margin than Mrs.

THE GREATEST HUMAN MONUMENT OF ALL AGES 



The observance of the anniversary of the Common- 
wealth Government of the Philippines on the 15th of 
this month which, this year, is the ninth- has a deeper 
meaning than in previous years. This time we are 
nearer the goal — not the goal of the ten-year transition 
period f July 4, 1946) as provided by the Tydings- 
McDuffie Law, enacted by Congress on March 24. 
1934, but — the goal of total Victory. Senate Joint 
Resolution 93. passed by Congress and signed by 
President Roosevelt last June 29. submerges the wait- 
ing period in the Tydings-McDuffk Law and grants 
Independence to the Filipino people the day the Japa- 
nese are driven out of the Philippines which, we 
fervently hope, will be before 1 946- This time we are 
nearer the goal of Victory. 

But the deeper significance of the present celebration 
is the vivid realization that when the Republic of the 
Philippines Is established in the Far East it will be the 
Greatest Human Monument that only a nation as the 
Untied Stares of America can fashion and build. 
Fashioned of human sacrifices and tears, of mutual 
friendship and respect. Built of precious blood and 
lives of Filipinos and Americans who fought and died 
on Bataan and Corregidor. Fashioned and built "OUT 
of the Crucible": 

"Up from the jungle, or from over the sea. 
They went over the top to eternity. 
Fused in that victorious fight . . * 
Men of Bataan, the brown and the white. 

"Chiseled on the fagade of time 

Is that story of a sub It me 

Will to be and will to do, 

The blaze of spirit that carried through. 

"No more an East — no more a West. 
There's only that fusing of the best 
Of them — MEN OF BATAAN." 

(Poem by Eve Balser) 

Love and ultimate joy will be the crowning glory 
of a Monument such as this. The pages of history, 
since time immemorial, may be scanned and certainly 
none can be found that parallels this case. When that 
Republic of the only Christian nation in the Orient is 
established historians shall write "the most heart- 
rending and inspiring story ever told/' 

It seemed destined that the United States should go 
to the Philippines and make of that country an outlet 
for her God-given gifts of love for freedom, justice 
and democracy. For it is obvious now that without 
those Islands America would have been devoid of the 
manifestation of her lofty ideals. 

It will be conjectured: Would not America's policy 



work out just as successfully with another subject 
people? 

The answer would be that it takes an equally brave 
and liberty-loving people to be appreciative of and 
amenable to such proffers of sublime goodness For 
just as it takes musically-inclined people to understand 
and appreciate music, and poetically-inclined people to 
absorb the hidden beauty of poetry, so docs it take a 
fight ing and freedom-loving people to understand and 
espouse the unselfish motives of a benevolent nation 

It seemed destined that the late Manuel L. Quezon 
should invite his bosom friend, then Lieutenant 
General MacArthur, at the outset of the establishment 
of the Commonwealth Government of the Philin 
pines in 1 935, to serve in the Philippines as Field 
Marshal. 

"MacArthur gained the confidence and love of the 
Filipino people. The fruit of Quezon's judgment was 
the complete reversal of Japan's plan to invade and 
control the entire Philippines by January 1 , 1 942 s; x 
months' resistance by the Filipino- American forces 
gave us here in America ample time to prepare- the 
same with Australia and other Allies of ours In the 
South Pacific." (Editorial in Thf P^A Obsfrvf* 
for August, 1943.) LR 
General MacArthur was ordered to leave the Philip- 
pines for Australia to organize the strong American 
offensive that is now taking place against Japan. He 
left the Islands he loved with a broken heart but with 
the firm determination to come back. His pledge was: 
"I shall return." 

For two and a half years MacArthur kept fighting 
and advancing nearer and nearer his goal: the recap- 
ture of Manila. Like his departed friend. Quezon, he 
was "not discouraged by difficulties and obstacles^ 
not even by reverses/' Alfred Tennyson miW 
Ulysses say: aKes 

my purpose holds 
To sail beyond the sunset and the baths 
Of all the western stars, until I die. 
It may he that the gulfs will wash us down ■ 
It may he we shall loach the Happy [ s ; es m - 
And Shakespeare makes Pericles say: 

" 'Like a bold champion. I assume the lists 
Nor ask advice of any other thought 
But faithfulness and courage." 
Those pertinently express the unswerving determ' 
tion of General Douglas MacArthur to redeemer 
pledge, to keep the soldier's faith, He is back in the 
Philippines now. He will be back in Manila before 
long. 

Such is the glorious Destiny of Philippine- American 
relations. The Filipinos, because of their faith in

THE GOAL 

Man may spend all his life 

In a scramble for wealth 
And he'll sacrifice all, 

Even honor and health. 
Or he'll search to the end 

For a place in the sun, 
With scarcely a pause 

Once the game is begun. 

But, should he gain his mark, 

Be it riches or fame, 
He will find after that 

The result is the same. 
For a pauper or king 

And a high priest and knave 
Look strangely alike when 

They're arranged in a grave. 

Then the gold and the brains 
Move the scales not an ounce, 

And man finds that the size 
Of his heart is what counts. 

— Don Kearns 



Beat True, My Heart 

Beat true, my heart, 
Beat true. 

Once more the shoulder to life's cart 
Now press, and nothing rue. 

Beat strong, my heart, 
Beat strong. 

Laugh at man's falsehood's poison 
dart 

Each foe defeat with song. 

Beat on, my heart, 
Beat on - — 

Until the time comes to depart . 
Then the last fight is won.

Seed Time and Harvest 

All over the town there flutter down 

V's for VICTORY — 
Tiny, winged messages 

Shaped most cleverly: 
The maples are broadcasting 

Their faith on every breeze 
That groves of future maples 

Will spring from winged Vs. 
— Anna Louise Barney 



VICTORY 

Ye that have faith to look with fearless eyes 

Beyond the tragedy of a world at strife 
And know that out of death and night shall rise 

The dawn of ampler life, 

Rejoice, whatever anguish rend the heart. 

That God has given you the priceless dower 
To live in these great times and have your part 

In freedom's crowning hour. 

That ye may tell your sons who see the light 
High in the heavens — their heritage to take —

MY NATIVE LAND 

Through the power of life, the miracle of birth, 
I am privileged to %vitness the glory of earth; 
As free as the light of the sun and the stars, 
So I am free, knowing no bonds nor bars. 
In the winds I caress the golden grain 
Of Russia's fertile fields, the vineyards of Spain; 
I ride the billows of the seven seas, 
And I scale the Alps and the Pyrenees. 

My flag waves above the frozen poles, 

JVIy national anthem sings in the souls 

Of freedom-loving men in a thousand lands, 

From the Borealis to Afric's sands. 

I know no boundary, and I know no creed, 

And if without the law the lesser breed 

In his ignorance does err or sin— what then? . . . 

He is my brother still. . . . . h too, know sin. 

From the Big Dipper to the Southern Cross, 
I bow to no king — I acknowledge no boss; 
Free I was born, and free I shall live , . . 
To the Nations United my allegiance I give. 
The desert, the jungle, the sea and the air, 
And Main Street I claim as my own anywhere, 
For this is my home — the land of my birth . . . 
My Native Land — My World! ... My Earth! 

— Lynn Hamilton 



America, struggled for their Independence not through 
bloodshed but through intelligent reasoning and un- 
derstanding; for they wanted to cooperate with her 
in showing and proving to the world that the freedom 
of a deserving subject people could be obtained from 
a sovereign power through peaceful and respectable 
means. But the wheels of Fate have turned to make 
not only Filipinos but Americans as well pay the 
supreme sacrifice for that freedom. Bataan, Corregidor 
and now Leyte have become veritable Crucibles out 



of which both people have brought the best in each of 
them. And the one and only Christian Republic in 
the Far East will be born. 

The observance of the ninth anniversary of the 
Commonwealth Government of the Philippines has a 
deeper meaning than previous anniversaries. It makes 
all the foregoing consummate and vivid before our 
eyes; and gives us a "preview" of the coming Philip- 
pine Republic — -the Greatest Human Monument of 
All Ages!

SERGIO OSMENA 

The New President of the Commonwea Ith 
Government of the Philippines 



NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE CALLED THE GREATEST 
FILIPINO STATESMAN BY THE LATE QUEZON 



By Dr. Diosado M. Yap 
Editor and Publisher, "Bataan" Magazine 




PRESIDENT SERGIO OSMENA 



Sergio Osmena who became president of the Philippine government- 
in-exile on August 1, 1944, and second man to hold the highest office 
his people can bestow, is familiar even to the youngest school-boy in 
Manila, where he had been a public figure for almost half a century 
before he fled before the approaching Japs in the spring of 1942 to come 
to this country and help set up the exile government under the late 
Manuel Luis Quezon. 

Few Americans know this silent, almost-stealthy Filipino leader who 
has been in Washington since mid- 1942 working with the armed services 
and the Office of War Information on war and propaganda devices by 
which his people might be freed. At 



25 years of age. he ran for provin- 
cial governor of Cebu and became 
the youngest elected executive in the 
islands. 

The greatest problem confront- 
ing young Osmena then was to put 
down the PULAHAN, or red. up- 
rising in his province. The outlaws 
were committing numerous depre- 
dations. They would swoop down 
upon a town or a village, and plun- 
der and pillage. By their atrocities 
they struck fear and terror into the 
hearts of the peaceful and law- 
abiding men and women. They 
vowed they would never lay down 
their arms, that they would never 
be taken alive. 

But once Osmena became pro- 
vincial governor, the leaders of the 
brigand band consented to meet 
him. While the reds were harassing 
and routing the forces of the gov- 
ernment in Negros, Leyte, Semar 
and many places in Luzon, Os- 
mena, practically alone and un- 
armed, went into the mountains of 
Cebu and met the leaders of the 
band. And Osmena- with that rare 
gift of personal charm all his own, 
convinced the bandits to lay down 
their arms. The Quintin brothers, 
outlaw leaders, voluntarily became 
his prisoners. The surrender of the 
PULAMAN in Cebu had its reper- 



cussions in the other provinces and 
soon the movement died out entirely, 
Overnight, Osmena leaped from 
comparative obscurity to national 
fame. 

The Act of Congress of July 1 . 
1902, promised the creation of a 
popular assembly as soon as general 
peace could be established in the 
islands. In the establishment of 
general peace and order, Osmena 
played a leading part. In the estab- 
lishment of the Philippines Assem- 
bly, Osmena had a major share. 

The success of the Assembly 
contributed largely to the estab- 
lishment of the Philippine Legisla- 
ture, and the success of the Legis- 
lature to the creation of the Philip- 
pine Congress under the Constitu- 
tion, 

When the delegates to the Philip- 
pine Assembly met for the first 
time, Sergio Osmena was a mere 
provinciano. Pedro Paterno was 
the outstanding figure. Paterno had 
presided over the Malolos Revolu- 
tionary Congress and the Malolos 
Constitutional Assembly, and had 
covered himself with prestige and 
glory. He was thus the logical man. 

But before the Assembly held its 
formal meeting to elect a speaker, 
Osmena had impressed the young 
and the old, the veterans and the 



recruits with bis personality. And 
when the voting came on October 
1 6, 1907, Osmena was elected by 
a unanimous vote. 

It is noteworthy to recall how 
that Assembly under the influence 
of Sergio Osmena functioned with 
clock-wise precision. The first or- 
ganization, the adoption of rules, 
and the preparation of messages 
and resolutions took but forty 
minutes. It is likewise significant 
that the first act passed by the As- 
sembly, within ten minutes after its 
organization, was the Gabaldon 
Law appropriating 1 ,000,000 
($500,000) pesos for the con- 
struction of bario schools. It was 
epochal, It showed what the Fili- 
pinos could do if given the chance 
to control their own affairs, 

It was an index to the work of 
construction that the Assembly set 
itself to perform in order to estab- 
lish a sure foundation for the future 
Filipino state. In Osmeha's fight 
for leadership, his men have always 
referred with pride to his record of 
constructive work as well as to his 
untarnished public and private life 
during the last thirty years that he 
has been elevated to some of the 
highest offices in the gift of his 
people. 

Prior to the first general elections 
in June, 1907, the party in power 
was the PART I DO FEDERAL. 
Osmena helped in the organization 
of the PART! DO NACIONAL- 
ISTA as the party of the opposi- 
tion. In the first general elections in 
1 907, Osmena's party, waving the 
banner of independence, swept the 
country. 

From 1907 to 1921, Osmena 
ruled supreme. But in 1916. Man-

uel L. Quezon, fresh from his con- 
quest as Resident Commissioner 
and flushing with justifiable pride, 
began to challenge the power of 
Osmena. 

The fight developed over the 
question of who should control the 
appointments — the President of 
the Senate or the President of the 
majority party, Quezon versus 
Osmena* The break was almost 
averted through an agreement to 
prevent the division of the ruling 
party and the weakening of the 
campaign for independence. A 
formal pact was signed to insure 
peace and unity, Osmena agreeing 
to abdicate some of his powers. But 
the following day, the pact became 
a mere scrap of paper when Quezon 
went ahead anyway and organized 
the COLLECTIVISTA PARTY. 

Quezon, a "new man/* fiery, 
tempestuous, theatrical, colorful, 
attracted to his standard the youth 
of the land. His battle-cry — "my 
loyalty to my party ends where my 
loyalty to my country begins," — 
and his attacks on the "caucus sys- 
tem" and alleged "despotism" and 
"cannon ism" and "unipersonal- 
ism" of Osmena had their telling 
effect. 

The election contest of 1922 
was a triangular fight among the 
COLLECTIVISTA PARTY 
headed by Manuel L. Quezon, the 
UNIPERSONALISTA headed by 
Sergio Osmena and the DEMO- 
CRATA headed by Juan Sumu- 
long. Quezon won, but his major- 
ity was not decisive, not even 
impressive. 

Soon afterwards, circumstances 
compelled the re-union of the 
COLLECTIVISTA and the UNL 
PERSONAL 1ST A in order to 
effect a working majority in the 
Legislature, under the banner of 

Si ^II DO NATIONAL IS 
TA-CONSOLID ADO , to the 
great discomfiture of the DEMO- 
CRATAS. 

The Quezon -Osmena alliance 
continued until the controversy 
over the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Law 
commenced in May, 1932, after 
the approval of the law on April 
4, 1932. F 

During the absence of the Os- 
mena-Roxas (OSROX) mission in 
America, President Quezon 
strengthed his hold. He was de- 
termined to be the leader, come 
what may, He reorganized the di- 
rectorate of the NACIONALISTA- 
CONSOLIDADO PARTY and 
eliminated Osmena and Roxas, He

self. He ousted Roxas from the

tempore presidency of the Senate, 
and all other OSROX men from 
committee chairmanships in both 
houses of the Legislature.

Quezon won the election over- 
whelmingly. 

When, in 1 935, officers of the 
new Commonwealth of the Philip- 
pines were to be chosen, Quezon 
and Osmena ran on the same ticket, 
They swept all opposition before 
them and since that time have had 
a well-nigh free hand in running 
Philippine affairs, 

Osmena showed the greatness of 
his spirit for the sake of his griev- 
ing country in November. 1 943

States was asked through the initia- 
tive of Mr. Osmena to keep Presi- 
dent Quezon in office as president of 
the Philippine governmenr-i n -exi_e 
for the duration of the war, not- 
withstanding that the Philippine 
Constitution forbade a president 
serving more than eight years. 

Mr. Osmena, who would have 
succeeded President Quezon on No- 
vember 15, 1943, said that he re- 
linquished his right because the 
interests of the United States and 
the Philippines in the war could be 
best served by keeping President 
Quezon m office. Thus, he gladly 
acquiesced in the movement which 
he himself initiated and stepped 
aside for the ailing leader, Quezon 

To the service of his country

bility of vision and steadfast, in- 
domitable courage. 

In 1900 r before his admission 
to the Philippine bar, he was editor 
of the newspaper NUEVO DIA, 
New Day. The words were pro- 
phetic of the future that was to 
come to the Philippines. 

His brilliant personality and 
outstanding ability as a construc- 
tive, sagacious leader early attracted 
the favorable attention of American 
administrators and it was in 1904 
that Governor General Luke E. 
Wright saw to it that he became 
governor of Cefcm, In October, 
1906, although the youngest of all 
provincial executives in the Philip- 
pines, he presided over the Assem- 
bly of provincial governors held in 
Manila and %vas elected chairman 
of that body. 

For a young man scarcely 28 
years of age, these were indeed dis- 
tinctive achievements. Neverthe- 
less, his public career had only just 
begun, for, in 1907, he was elected 
Delegate to the first Philippine As- 
sembly, and it was in the Assembly, 
as Speaker from 1907 until 1916, 
that he performed what was per- 
haps his greatest patriotic service in 
so conducting this legislative body 
as to make good the claim of the 
Filipino people to self-government. 

After the creation of the Philip- 
pine Senate in accordance with the 
provisions of the Jones Law in 
1916, Sergio Osrnena was urged by 
his friends to seek election as Sena- 
tor, but this he could not bring 
himself to do until six years later, 
so great was his interest in the work 
of the Lower House and his loyalty 
to it, which he regarded as a combi- 
nation of the Philippine Assembly, 
In 1922 t however, after remaining 
continuously in the House of Rep- 
resentatives as Speaker, he was 
elected Senator from the Tenth 
District, and continuously served 
in this capacity until November, 
1935, when he became Vice Presi- 
dent of the Philippine Common- 
wealth. 

When the Japanese warships 
were steaming into the harbor of 
Cebu, where Osrnena was the first 
governor, the same Osrnena who 
had climbed the mountains more 
than thirty years before to quell 
the red uprising went back to confer 
with leaders from ail parts of the 
Visayan Islands, who had been 
summoned there upon the instruc- 
tions of President Quezon. 

While Cebu City was being sub- 
jected to a devastating raid by 



Japanese war birds, Osrnena man- 
aged to escape from the bombs, re- 
turned safely to Negros, and sub- 
mitted his report to Quezon. From 
Negros both Quezon and Osrnena 
made their epochal voyage to Aus- 
tralia to rejoin with General 
Douglas MacArthur and thence to 
Washington, D. C 

During this time of storm and 
stress, of untold difficulties and 
hardships, of planning and adjust- 
ing, of construction and reconstruc- 
tion, the leaders of the Philippine 
government, particularly Osrnena, 
gave evidence of their statesmanship 
and ability. As President Quezon 
said on one occasion: "Osrnena is 
the best statesman the Philippines 
has ever produced," 

The consistency of OsmenVs 
leadership and statesmanship is best 
evidenced by his unwavering stand 
on Philippine independence and by 
his faith in the integrity of the 
American people. He alone of all 
the leaders of the Filipino people 
has steered unswervingly along the 
path of duty he has chosen to take. 

The best epitome of Philippine- 
American relations that has ever 
been uttered, which express Os- 
mena's consistent views, is that 
which he himself made on the occa- 
sion commemorating the sixth an- 
niversary of the establishment of 
the Commonwealth of the Philip- 
pines: 

"The history of American ad- 
venture in political idealism in the 
Philippines is unique, Nothing like 
it had ever been seen in the often 
tragic relations between sovereign 
powers and their colonies. Never- 
theless, there are those who have 
attributed the passage of the Inde- 
pendence Act to selfish motives- 
This is indeed a great error. 

' Although there is no human 
action that is completely free from 
egoistic influence, what Schurman 
said with respect to the motives 
that led President McKinley and 
the American people to insist on the 
relinquishment of Spain's sover- 
eignty over the Philippines may be 
said with equal truth with regard 
to the decision of the American 
Congress of prescribing the process 
by which American authority 
would be terminated and the inde- 
pendence of the Philippines finally 
proclaimed. 

Particular economic interests — 
those concerned with sugar, cotton- 
seed Qi], cordage and other products 
—may have entered into the con- 
sideration of the Independence 



Law, but they were not the decisive 
factor. It was the deep sense of a 
moral obligation on the part of the 
United States to redeem its pledge 
of liberty to the Filipinos and to 
carry to a successful conclusion its 
idealistic mission in these islands 
that moved Congress to grant us 
our independence- 

"Truly, it can be said that the 
same lofty purpose which brought 
the American flag to our shores 
motivated the decision to haul it 
down." 

In Osmena's fight for national 
leadership, his men and followers 
always have referred to his record 
of constructive work with pride, as 
well as his untarnished public and 
private life during the long years of 
public service, devotion and con- 
secration to the ideals of his people. 

He and Quezon did not always 
see alike as to how to get their 
aims, but no one in the Philippines 
doubted that both men were single- 
hearted in one respect: Each wanted 
to serve the interests of the Fili- 
pinos and the Philippines, for 
which each had fought for decades, 
both on sanguine battlefields and 
in the marble halls of the Congress 
of the United States. 

As President Osrnena declared on 
the day he took office, following 
the death of gallant Quezon, his 
aims are the same as those of his 
predecessor. Fate has decreed that 
Quezon, who lived among his peo- 
ple and loved them so long, should 
die in an adopted land. The same 
fate has decreed that Osrnena. 
scholar, statesman and serene direc- 
tor; shall lead his people when the 
Japanese scourge has been elimi- 
nated from the Philippines.

Family of Late Philippine President Comes To Live 
In Southland For The Duration 





Mrs. Manuel L. Quezon, widow of the late Philippine President, and her three children — Manuel 18, Maria Zenaida 20, 

and Maria Aurora 21 — as they arrived at Los Angeles, November 3, 

t 



Mrs. Manuel L. Quezon, widow 
of the late President of the Com- 
mon wealth Government of the 
Philippines, and her three children 
arrived in Los Angeles last week 
(Nov. 3) from Washington, D.C 
They intend to live here until the 
homeland is liberated. 

Mrs. Quezon was in deep 
mourning, She expressed great joy, 
however, at the favorable reports 
being made in the reconquest of the 
Philippines. And as for the South- 
land she said that she and her chil- 
dren liked it for they lived here for 
a few months six years ago. They 
came back to the United States 
with the late President Quezon, in 
May, I 942. after their escape from 
Corregidor. 

The family arrived at Chicago 
November l to change trains for 
California. In the interim, at Mrs. 
Quezon's request, Rev. William A, 
Fletcher (formerly of Manila) cel- 
ebrated a mass in a Catholic church. 
Among those present were Mrs, 
Lester J, Tacy and Col. Jay J. 
McCarthy. As Mrs. Tacy said, 
Mrs. Quezon "sought the sanctu- 
ary of the church in her bereave- 



ment over the loss of her husband, 
and the solace and inspiration of 
Father Fletchers words in addition 
to her own prayers for the libera- 
tion of the Filipino people and for 
the liberation of the American peo- 
ple, both military and civilian, who 
are prisoners of the Japanese." Mrs. 
Tacy's husband, Col. Lester J. 




COL, MANUEL N I ETO 



Tacy. was Commander of the 24th 
Field Artillery, captured by the 
Japs on Bataan, and held a prisoner 
since then. 

Accompanying the family on 
this trip were Col. Manuel Nieto, 
who was military aide to President 
Quezon, and Col. E. C. Cruz, the 
President's personal physician, who 
escaped with him from Corregidor. 
Both are returning to Washington, 
The Quezon children will con- 
tinue their srudies here. Manuel, 
18, is going to take up law at 
Loyola University. Maria Aurora 
is 21. and Maria Zcmaida is 20, 
But, as Mrs. Quezon said, they 
"live only in suitcases"; meaning 
that should the Philippines be re- 
taken in a year or so, they are al- 
ready to go — - back borne.

use of the Red Cross. This number 
was exceeded ; more than sixty am- 
bulances were bought, 

Every member put her efforts in 
the campaign which was chair- 
manned by Mrs. Carolyn Mcln- 
tyre. She and Mmes. P. A. Peterson 
and J. Renick each received a 
citation from the War Finance De- 
partment for selling the most

ing- now, making clothes and assisting* the Filipino War Relief, Inc., 
in organizing and planning for relief in the Philippines." 

Mrs, Lim returned to the West Coast to bring her three children back 
to Washington, D. C. t where she will assume her new duties in the 
Philippine Commonwealth offices*

The 

WELLERSONS 

OF NEW YORK 

Internationally Renowned Couple Are As 
Modest As They Are Famous; Devote 
Activities in Contribution to War Effort 




IDA N, WELLERSON 



DR. MAX WELLERSON 



The saying that "the simplest is 
the best" finds a niche in the life of 
the Welle rsons — Dr. and Mrs, 
Max Wellerson of New York City, 
musicians of international repute. 
Mrs. Wcllerson was Ida Nachman- 
owitz before her marriage. 

They live simply at their spa- 
cious apartment on Riverside Drive, 
which houses also the Wellerson 
Studios, Since Pearl Harbor they 
organized weekly musical and cul- 
ultural programs called, "Evenings 
with the Wellersons/' It did not 
take long for these gatherings to 
grow and so those "evenings" were held 
at a bigger place where the increased num- 
ber of attendance could be accommodated. 
The entire net proceeds from these pro- 
grams were turned over to Russian War 
Relief. United China Relief. American Red 
Cross (which included Filipino War Re- 
lief) and USO. 

This writer asked Mrs. Wellerson why 
their agent didn't get a booking for a 
season at the Hollywood Bowl for them? 
"Because/' she said, ' when Mr. Wellerson 
and I were married, we had to make an 
important decision: either we would travel 
over the face of the globe as a piano team, 
make a lot of money but live in hotels and 
never have a home of our own — or settle 
down in New York as teachers, earn less 
money but have a place where we can find 
sanctuary, eat our own simply -cooked 
food and keep our health intact. We dc^ 
dded on the latter, and therefore the only 
free time we have for traveling engage- 
ments is in the summer. By accepting en- 
gagements in summer resorts we combine 
vacations with performances, which is a 
particularly desirable arrangement, now 
that war time travel is so difficult, We 
hevc been in Europe and various parts of 
the United States before the war. but we 
feel we are better off near home these days. 

Mrs Wellerson joined the American 
Women's Voluntary Services (AWVS) at 
the outbreak of the war, A reporter wrote 
that ever since Mrs, Wellerson became a 
■ woman in uniform," she and her famous 
husband have spared neither time, money 
nor ounce of their human strength and 
endurance for the war effort. They have 
been making concert appearances in and 
out of New York to raise funds for war 
relief and to make life more cheerful for 
our servicemen in canteens, government 
hospitals and institutions for sick and dis- 



NOVEMBER, 1944 



a bled merchant marines, without regard to 
race or creed. She has a number of adopted 
sons in our armed forces, of different 
nationalities and at least a dozen of them 
are Filipinos. To some of them she writes 
most every day, And as early as last 
August she was already preparing Christ- 
mas packages for each one of them. 

Besides being a celebrated pianist, being 
the other half of the internationally re- 
nowned duo. Mrs. Wellerson is also a 
poet. She is the author of a unique volume 
of verses, called "Rhymes To Music You 
Love." a book which is, as Prof, Janet 
Rankin Aiken of Columbia University 
said T 'concerned with everyday matters, 
and follows Wordsworth's dictum that 
poetry must serve a moral purpose, it 
reflects a broad sympathy with humankind, 
striking a popular note which is refresh- 
ing." 

Her remarkable poem. "A Study in Pig- 
mentation/' (which was printed in the last 
issue of this magazine) , is included in that 
volume. In 1935 it attracted the attention 
of the late President Manuel L. Quezon. 
In the presence of hundreds of prominent 
people of New York, at a banquet in his 
honor, Quezon said, "This is the most 
wonderful poem I have ever heard in my 
life" (Quezon's exact words). She later 
dedicated this work to the Philippine Presi- 
dent, In 1 939, at the New York World's 
Fair, this poem was awarded first prize. 
The same poem won another high honor 
when the World's Fair reopened in 1940 
awarded by the National Poetry Center, A 
Study in Pigmentation" is included in the 
New York World s Fair Anthology re- 
cently published by the Poets Press, New 
York City. 

Dr. Wellerson, a descendant of a long 
line of famous musicians, was born in Rus- 
sia where he studied and made concert 
appearances as a child. Later ke came to 



ihc United States, was graduated from 
Teachers College, Columbia University in 
New York City, and became assistant 
teacher to Dr. William Mason (a pupil 
of Liszt) , 

The brief sketch about him continues: 
"After several years of highly successful 
concert tours both in the United States 
and Europe, he returned to this country 
and for a number of years he has been 
tcaehing and making concert appearances 
as soloist and in piano duos with Ida N. 
Wcllerson. 

"Many of his pupils have been awarded 
important prizes in various musical con- 
tests throughout the country. Also, he has 
invented a unique piano method which is 
in use extensively by teachers in various 
cities in the United States/" 

In their large apartment on Riverside 
Drive, the Welle rsons have a special 
"Philippine Walk" On it hang pictures 
of their many Filipino friends — from the 
great Quezon and Osmcna; Romulo, the 
late Francisco Varona* Camilo Osias, Man- 
uel A. Adeva ; and so on down the line, 
including pictures of most of their acJpP 1 ^ 
sons in the armed forces. 

When the war is over the Wellersons 
have a definite plan to visit and tour the 
Philippines. And they might even decide 
to live there. With their name already 
famous more than half way around the 
world and with heart and goodness which 
the Filipinos know they have, they will 
be most welcome there and those with 
whom they made friends here would be 
glad of the opportunity to return their 
kindness and hospitality. And in fact 
their musical and cultural programs would 
u'ork out quite well there, too. 

The Wellersons are a great asset to 
better understanding and friendship among 
people of different races, nationalities or 
creeds.

WOUNDED IN LEYTE 

Brigadier-General Carlos P.

of the Philippines, was wounded 
by a piece of shrapnel from a Jap 
bomb that exploded in the Taclo- 
ban battle sector the morning of 
Oct, 25, according to press reports 
recently received in the United 
States. The bomb killed seven men 
outright and seriously injured 
eleven. 

General Romulo did not know 
he was wounded until the surgeon 
who was dressing the wounds of a 
sentry saw the general bleeding in 
the face. He was hit by the piece of 
shrapnel on the right cheek and was 
bleeding profusely, 

General MacArthur awarded the 
Oak Leaf Cluster to General Rom- 
ulo when he visited him the fol- 
low day. Gen. Romulo is already 
the wearer of the Purple Heart, the 
Silver Star, the Distinguished Serv- 
ice Star, the Presidential Citation,

Americans we should give expres- 
sion to this most precious right of 
democracy by making sure that we 
vote and that we urge all our 
friends to do likewise/' 

Mrs, Douglas was endorsed by

THE PHILIPPJNE-AMERICAN OBSERVER 



The "Mothers" Group Racket 



in 



Among the groups engaged in spreading Nazi doctrines in America 
an attempt to undermine democracy, there are a number of so-called 
"Mothers" groups about which the public should be more fully in- 
formed. Names like "American," "patriotic," "Christian," used by 
most subversive movements to conceal the true nature of their activities, 
are also prominently featured by dozens of "Mothers" clubs that have 
sprung up in American cities, Sepa- — . 



rate groups, they are iT yet linked 
together by a common program of 
action, and more specifically by a 
continual interchange of letters 
among the leaders, and of literature 
and speakers. Most of them are 
isolationist, anti-British, anti-Rus- 
sian, often anti-Semitic. All of 
them make political capital of the 
very natural anxiety which every 
mother with children in the service 
feels. 

These clubs have been thor- 
oughly investigated most recently 
by the Woman's Home Compan- 
ion,* and six were found to be the 
most influential: the Mothers of 
Sons Forum; Wc. the Mothers, 
Mobilize for America, Inc.; Ameri- 
can Mothers; Loyal American 
Mothers; National Blue Star 
Mothers of America (formerly 
Crusading Mothers of Philadel- 
phia), and Mothers and Daughters 
of Pennsylvania. 

The MOTHERS OF SONS 
FORUM was founded in Cincin- 
nati in 1939 by Mrs. Josephine 
Mahler, to keep America out of 
war. By June, 1940, she had 
65,000 names on petition against 
enactment of the Selective Service 
Act. The present leader is Mrs. 
Lucinda Benge, rabidly isolationist, 
more worried about the motives of 
our Allies and what she calls the 
"Russian menace" than enemy ide- 
ologies, Though not specific, she 
claims a large number of active 
members, a larger number of in- 
active ones who contribute funds 
which enable Mrs. Benge to visit 
other lenders, hire halls and print 
pamphlets* 

WE THE MOTHERS, MO- 
BILIZE FOR AMERICA. INC, 
of Chicago, one of the largest of 
these groups, is led by Mrs, Lyrl C 
Van Hyning, who sees her follow- 
ers as "rather stupid" women who 
"will work hard for me, and that's 
what is important." Among her 
favorite projects are: "Women's 
Voice," an eight-page monthly 
publication for 20.000 subscribers: 



* See iht! Mother Rocket, Woman's 
Home Companion, July. 1944, 



an impcach-rhe-President move- 
ment; and an attempt to get mem- 
bers and friends of WE, THE 
MOTHERS, elected as delegates to 
the Republican convention, to help 
nominate what is called a "nation- 
alist" candidate for the Presidency, 
who will be isolationist, anti- 
British. anti-Russian. Typical ex- 
ample of this group's activities is 
the letter that was sent to parents 
of the American boys who died 
when the destroyer, Reuben James, 
was sunk by a submarine off New- 
foundland in 1941. The letter, 
addressed to each parent, urged 
that "the real murderers" of their 
boy, "the men who violated the 
Constitution of the United States 
by sending him into the war zone/' 
be called to account. 

AMERICAN MOTHERS in 
Detroit was formerly known as 
Mothers of the U. S. A. , led by 
Mrs. Rose Farber. The new na- 
tional chairman is Mrs. Beatrice 
Knowles, whose home serves as an 
office for the distribution of mimeo- 
graphed hate leaflets, among them 
the pamphlets of Gerald L. K. 
Smith, ro a mailing list which she 
claims, includes between 35.000 
and 54 T 000 names. Voluntary con- 
tributions pay for this and the trips 
to Washington, D. C, which Mrs. 
Knowles makes every few nionths_ 
Rationing, price ceilings, draft or 
manpower and the teaching or tol- 
erance in the schools are policies 
against which Mrs. Knowles takes 
a firm stand, She is a friend of Mrs.

MOTHERS AND DAUGH- 
TERS OF PENNSYLVANIA is 
a Philadelphia organization func- 
tioning mainly through a news 
letter edited by Irene Thome 
Murphy, former Coughlinite and 
secretary of America First. 

Mrs, Agnes Waters represents 
many of the above groups before 
congressional committees in Wash- 
ington, She has a campaign under 
way to have herself elected Presi- 
dent of the United States. Her 
platform: "Let us demand that 
this war be stopped at once. Let's 
keep a clothesline handy in every 
little back yard to hang the traitors, 
or a gun/' She advocates getting 
"these trairors out of office . . t 
(by) > > ♦ shooting them out. This 
would be easier than to fool with 
elections." 

There is no way of computing 
the actual membership of these 
racketeering groups, but they have 
a sizeable number of supporters 
throughout the country, many per- 
haps unaware of their true purpose. 
Thousands of women, on the 
other hand, are enrolled in the bona 
fide 'mother" organizations, such 
as the BLUE STAR MOTHERS 
OF AMERICA, AMERICAN 
WAC MOTHERS, NAVY 
MOTHERS. MOTHERS OF 
WORLD WAR II, and MOTH- 
ERS OF MEN IN SERVICE 
(MOMS) OF AMERICA. These 
groups do excellent work, provid- 
ing canteens, camp services and 
programs of recreation for the men 
in service hospitals. They also man 
blood donor centers, help the Red 
Cross and the USO, sell war bonds. 
These mothers are aiding the war 
effort, doing all they can to bring 
the war to a speedy, but victorious 
end, 

Women who seek affiliation 
with mothers organizations should 
be urged to investigate them thor- 
oughly, lest they be exploited by 
professional dealers in hatred who 
grind their own political axes and 
play the enemy's propaganda game 
with the help of the unwary.

Now that the Philippines is well on its way to deliverance from the bloody hands 
of the Japanese, it is but proper and timely that the Americans should know about the 
unusual beauty with which nature has endowed those lovely isles of the Eastern Seas — 
lovely isles that compose the Beautiful Philippines. — EDITOR. 




Montalban Gorge contains the 
reservoir whence Manila derives its 
water supply. There is a cave open- 
ing just above the river bank ex- 
tending - — they whose courage and 
liking for bats will permit can 
verify this - — clear through the 
mountains. 

Antipolo has the shrine of Our 
Lady of Good Voyages, the image 
of the Virgin brought from Mexico 
to insure the safety of the galleons 
from the anger of the sea, and the 
attacks of the priates who used to 
lie in wait in the San Bernardino 
Strait and the Verde Island Pas- 
sage, It is dressed in a robe that 
falls in a cone, so stiff it is with 
gold, and its jewels are of enormous 
value. 

The ruins of the Guadalupe 
Church and the Bamboo Organ at 
Las Pinas are featured in all the 
guide books. 

Fort McKinley, America's largest 
Army post, in point of acreage, is 
close to Manila, too. 

The spin to Lucena and on to 
Atimonan, both in Tayabas, over 
the South Road, is a favorite one. 
On the east are the iittle towns of 
Binangonan de Lampon, a cele- 
brated port in the sixteenth century 
in the galleon trade, and the land- 
locked harbor of Hondagua. 

Farther south, in Albay, Cama- 
rines and Sorsogon, are beautiful 
mountain views and extensive 
plantations of coconut and hemp, 
Peerless Mayon of the perfect cone 
is in Albay, the volcano of Isarog 
in Camarines, and Bulusan in 
Sorsogon, 



In Bataan and Batangas, west 
and south of Manila, respectively, 
are orange groves and coffee and 
fruit orchards. At Limay, in Ba- 
taan, is a big lumber milh A nar- 
row gauge road leads back into the 
heart of a magnificent dipterocarp 
forest where the felling and logging 
of superb hardwoods are going on. 

Batangas has Taal (volcano) 
the terrible. A small launch carries 
those who would look down into 
the crater o fthe grim volcano across 
Lake Bombon to the island from 
which Taal rises, somewhat under 
a thousand feet in height, and fairly 
easy to climb. 

Across the bay is Cavite, a pretty 
little old town of historic interest, 
also the U S. Navy base and radio 
station in the Philippines; an en- 
joyable short voyage up the coast 
to Olongapo where the dry dock 
Dewey is located, affords views of 
Zambales Province. Corregidor, 
The Rock/' the Gibraltar of the 
Far East, is the home of the big 
guns that guard the harbor, and an 
army and hydroplane station. 
Manveles, the quarantine station, 
beyond Corregidor, that no one 
cares to be invited by the Govern- 
ment to look over, is a pretty spot 
to go to for an excursion. 

Pampanga is Luzon's sugar prov- 
ince, the rival of Negros Occidental 

^ modern centrals there and the 
fields of growing cane; Camp Stot- 
senburg, one of the principal army 
posts and the aeroplane station; 
San Fernando, with its strikingly 
handsome capitol, school and other 
buildings grouped about the pretty 



plaza, are all well worth seeing. 
Pangasinan, the "rice granary" of 
the Philippines, Tarlac and Nueva 
Ecija, a farming cattle and hunting 
country, are within automobile 
distance, 

Baguio, which is often called the 
Simla of the Philippines, is classed 
with even more famous mountain 
resorts by its admirers; that is, all 
who know it. 

The Benguet road is the most 
traveled route. It leaves the low- 
lands at Dagupan and now ascends, 
now crosses and recrosses the grove 
of the Bued river, coiling back on 
itself in the famous Zigzag. Cooler 
and cooler grows the air, behind 
drops all the lowland vegetation, 
to make room for the sturdy trees 
of the temperate zones. Wave on 
wave the trees roll up the moun- 
tains that stand on each other's 
shoulders below, around and above 
the small tableland on which Ba- 
guio edges away from the sheer 
precipice at the head of the gorge. 

For some years a summer capital 
to which the Government trans- 
ferred its work and personnel dur- 
ing the hot months, it is a chartered 
city, but the all-year residents are 
few, though many of the well-to- 
do of Manila have summer homes 
there. It has modern hotels. Camp 
John Hay, the military hospital 
post, is the main show place, among 
its beauties being the open air am- 
pitheatcr that General Bell built 
with mountaineer labor, terraced 
as their wonderful rice terraces are, 
and gay with flowers. 
Other places to see are the Mansion 
House, the official summer residence 
of the U. S. High Commissioner; 
Bishop Brent's Schools for AmerL

SAN PEDRO COMMUNITY STARTS OFF STRONG 

First Filipino Float Entered In July 4th Parade Wins Prize 



The Filipino Community of San 
Pedro was scarcely two months old 
last July Fourth yet it was able to 
enter a float in the annual civic pa- 
rade that day — and won a prize. 
"Bataan Frontier" was the name of 
the float, depicting the loyalty of 
the Filipinos to Uncle Sam. 

The float cost more than three 
hundred dollars, which was easily 
raised by the hard-working treas- 
urer, Jimmy Del Risma, owner of 
the Star Cafe, through voluntary 
contributions by the Filipino busi- 
nessmen of San Pedro, mostly cafe 
owners; but Del Risma himself 
contributed the most. 

Below is a picture of that com- 
munity's prize-winning entry. The 
Army, Navy and Merchant Marine 
are represented there; so are the 
Filipino nurses (by Mrs. Salvacion 
Monteclaro) and the WAC (by 
Mrs. Pauline Laag) . Pedro Monte- 
claro was the driver of the float.

INTERNATIONAL 

Don't get fooled, folks. This 
isn't Harold Lloyd. But he is the 
Filipino Harold Lloyd — Vicente 
Yerro. 

Far away and long ago (my! 
my! oh. time in thy flight!), back 




VICENTE YERRO 
As the Filipino Harold Lloyd 

in the Philippines, Yerro was un- 
rivaled as topnotch comedian. A 
native of Leyte. he joined the no- 
madic Boholano cloth-and-trinket 
peddlers to different parts of Lu- 
zon; but Vicente decided to stay 
put in Manila. There he got funny 
. . . and got married — to a sweet 
Ilocana girl, also an actress. And 
lived not happily ever after. So he 
shipped out to Hawaii (no. not as 
sacada, ay de mi!). He joined a 
vaudeville troupe. As expected, he 
made good. His best act was imper- 
sonating Harold Lloyd. 

After about a year in that Island 
Paradise, the troupe came to the 
mainland — yes, Vincent (call him 
"Vincent" in Yankish) was with 
the troupe. After several perform- 
ances in Los Angeles (not so good 
in coffer returns: this was no longer 
P. I. or Hawaii), the members of 
the road agreed to disagree — actors, 
actresses, musicians, managers, et 
cetera. Everyone for himself- — and 
Yerro once more became his real 
self. He always likes to bill himself 
solo. 

Here he appeared at well-known 
theaters: and his big chance came 
when he was signed by Fanchon- 
Marco and toured the country for 
forty weeks. Since then he has been 
playing Big Time. 

One thing admirable about Yerro 
is that he never did and never does 
want to be billed out as anything 
but as a Filipino, unlike other 



ENTERTAINER 

countrymen of ours who could not 
appear on the stage unless dis- 
guised as Chinese, South American, 
or Hindu. Yerro is confident of his 
histrionic ability and is proud of it 
— and proud as a Filipino actor. 

There is only one other Filipino 
vaudeville actor in America who 
prides in his identity, and in all his 
bookings he gives the following 
complete: Ben Chavez — The Boy 
From Manila. 

Several years ago, when Vicente 
Yerro was still in Los Angeles, he 
and Chavez got into an argument 
as to who was the first to use that 
title. "The Boy From Manila": 
who originated it. Yerro or Cha- 
vez? Each claimed he did. Both 
came to this writer because he was 
the one who gave each his early 
publicity. Decision? It was Ben 

BUSINESSMAN 

Zacarias (Al) Mesa is the senior 
partner of the owners of the 
L-V-M Cafe in San Pedro. He docs 
not believe in making his money 
lay idle; hence he has many invest- 
ments in the harbor city. Engaged 
in restaurant business himself he 
has interests also in two or three 
other Filipino eating places in San 
Pedro. In addition, he is manager 
of a hotel there. 

Al was inducted into the U. S. 
Army, at Long Beach, in 1942. 
After one year service he was dis- 
charged on account of age. "But I 
am still in the service," he said, 
"you see. I'm a consistent buyer 
of War Bonds." 




Boy From Manila. 

Yerro is now settled at Chicago. 
He has been playing at night clubs 
there as master of ceremonies and 
feature entertainer, the last place 




VICENTE YERRO 

being the lively Flamingo night 
club. 

Last we heard from him he was 
playing at Washington, D. Q A 
couple weeks before that he wrote 
from Huntington. Indiana, doing 
a show there, too. Keep going, ol' 
topper! You should be sent to 
your natal province of Leyte this 
time to entertain the American and 
Filipino G.I.'s there! Isn't that an 
idea ?

Amado E* Dino 



Until one has been to Washington and 
actually s ^n the working of the Com- 
monwealth Government of the Philippines- 
m-cxilc, he would be merely talking 
through his tot when fae essay, criticism! 
against the officials and the personnel of 
che different offices. Those who pose as 
criticasters arc comparable to the proverbial 
lox and the sour grapes — wanted desk 
jobs and when couldn't get them turned 
about face and attacked the higher-ups; or 
not having a chance anyway, decided/ out 
of jealousy or just showing off. to commit 
the same malevolence as that by the other 
group. 

The fact is that Washington has seen 
tor once what kind of officials the Philip- 
pine Govcrnmcnt-in-exile has; their ability 
and tenacity to work, and how they dis- 
charge their respective duties. Of course, as 
the case always is, there are exceptions 
which, in this case, one can count on his 
fingers of one hand; and this mere handful 
is not even altogether useless — - i t brines 
the industrious and capable into "bold 
relief." 

Noteworthy in these officials whom 
Quezon and Osmefia brought to Washing- 
ton are their honesty, ability and integrity 
To cite just a few examples, there arc 
Birg,-Gen. Carlos P + Romulo (he Camc 
later, sent by Gen. Mac Arthur) , Col 
Manuel Nieto and Auditor General Jaime 
Hernandez, who is at present the man in 
charge of the Government-in-exile at 
Washington in the absence of President 
Osmefia and Gen. Romulo, 

I do not know Hernandez very well per- 
sonally, having met him only once last 
summer, but the glowing terms in which 
President Osmefia spoke of him to me en- 
abled me to get an inside view of his 
sterling character and unstinted record ever 
since he entered the government service. 

When. Col, Andres Soriano resigned his 
post of Secretary of Finance last March, no 
one was appointed to take his place. Presi- 
dent Osmefia explained, after he assumed 
the presidency, that Mr, Hernandez would 
function as Finance Secretary in addition 
to his own cabinet status. That Hernandez 
is today the Number One man of our gov- 
ernment at Washington proves his high 
standing and importance, 
* * * 

Col. Nieto is the man who has been 
closest to the great Quezon. For twenty 
years he has been the late President's per- 
sonal aide and most trusted friend, Quezon 
was noted as a good selector of persons— 
as officials and as friends— and was a very 
difficult man to get along with unless one 
was himself alert, active, honest and 
straightforward, Possessed with these qual- 
ities a man would make fast friends with 
him. Nieto easily made the grade. No one 



man had constantly been with the Filipino 
leader until his death as had the Colonel. 

CoL Nieto said to me one time: ''Presi- 
dent Quezon was a friend, a tutor, a bro- 
ther, a father — -everything that was good 
and ennobling: he was ever so full of life, 
never knew what discouragement meant, 
seriously concerned with the welfare of 
our country and people at all times, and so 
human, too/' 

By that token Nieto has the distinction 
of being the man who knows the intimate 
life— politically and otherwise — of the 
great Filipino leader. In fact he amounts 
more to Quezon than Col. House did to 
Wilson. Thus, the biography of Manuel 
L - Quezon, on which he is hard at work 
to finish (publishers want the completed 
manuscript by December 1), should be a 
most authentic volume. And I understand 
tftc motion picture story will be based on 
that book, 

Nieto 's patriotism is contagious. Cir- 
cumstances emanating from governmental 
cities keep him in Washington, otherwise 
\u \° uld have been in Leytc now, too. In 
P snington Ust August while he and Gen, 
^° mul ° (then Colonel) and I were to- 
gether. Col, Nieto's recurring talk was 
*POUt the aid—food, medicine and clothing 
At should b c sent to the Philippines. 

U f lmc P ^sidcnt Osmefia had just 
^ppomted him Chairman of the Philippine 
war Rehef Committee; this was different 
n° n - Philippine War Relief (of the 

F^!!i x? tates >- Inc ' headed by Justice 
fci i Murphy. Very recently, however, 
this body has been absorbed by the U. $.

and In ? most energetic, consistent 

been ™„ ■ Worki "g official that has ever 
Amcrir, T nce the advent of Filipinos to 
conferri^ auririg here and there, writing, 
8 ' missionarying — all in [he inter - 



est of his people. He is by far the greatest 
exponent of Philippine-American relation- 
ship and friendship. In all his speeches he 
stressed the need for American understand- 
ing of the fine, the true quality of the 
Filipino people. 

Gen. Romulo's achievements make my 
memory dart back to yesteryear, in my 
home town of Sorsogon, when for the 
first time I saw a high school Annual. I 
was just finishing the intermediate school 
then, and Juan S. Reves, brother of Jose S. 
Reyes (who later became Dean of the Uni- 
versity of the Philippines. Southern 
Branch, in Cebu) . and both classmates of 
Carlos P. Romulo, gave me a copy of 
their Manila High School Annual, Class of 
J 9 16, edited by Romulo. It was quite a 
splendid publication in every respect — con- 
tents, make-up. etc. — comparable to if not 
surpassing most of the high school annuals 
in America. I gave it to a teacher in Los 
Angeles because she was attracted by it and 
asked for it, 

In it I noted that Romulo was star de- 
bater and captain of the Cryptia Debating 
Society, winner of the annual oratorical 
contest, excelled in literature but a fioppero 
iu math. The short story prize went to 
Jose S- Reyes with his "The Inside of His 
Cup," story of a politician, a hypocrite. 
In passing, I wish to mention that, accord- 
ing to that book, the Reyes brothers of 
Sorsogon, and Romulo of Tarlac, failed 
to make the grade to be included among 
the first ten highest upon their graduation. 
Yet. Juan S. became Governor of Sorsogon 
Province (he was an Army officer at the 
outbreak of this war) , Jose S. became a 
College Dean and technical adviser to 
Quezon at Washington — and look where 
Romulo is now! And we haven* t heard 
anything about those "first ten." even the 
valedictorian and salutatorian. Doesn't al- 
ways happen like that, though: many top- 
notchers of the class usually make good, 

Romulo's motto in that book was— 
"EXCELSIOR !' r Meaning higher, yet 
higher, still higher! Well the General 
certainly has lived up to his motto, And 
he has not reached the heights yet. Some 
day he may become President of the Philip- 
pines. Hold on to your motto. General 
Romulo — EXCELSIOR! 

* * * 

With such men as I have just 
described, immediate subordinates 
of President Sergio Osmena, the 
greatest Filipino statesman today, 
steering the wheel of our Govern- 
ment; I really do not know on 
what basis those gripers criticize 
our Government officials (and not 
making even an ounce of allowance 
for the circumstances prevalent 
these days) , unless it is plain covet- 
ousness, or sour-grapes, or show- 
off, as mentioned early in this 
columnar talk. 

With such men, their quality 
and ability, any government would 
be justified in its pride as it points 
to them — "There are my good, 
my able and faithful servants!" 

Well, so long folks — -See you in 
Manila!
