My dear General Bnbick: 

Acknowledgment is made of the receipt of the War Depart- 
ment’s note verbale (BIA) of September 14, 1936, relative to 
a Belgian decoration for General Basilio J. Valdes of the 
Philippine Army. 

On August 26, 1933, the Secretary of state advised the 
Secretary of War of the receipt of certain decorations con- 
ferred by the King of the Belgians upon Lieutenant colonel 
Basilio J. Valdes and certain other officers in the Philippine 
Service, and stated that "in accordance with existing legislation 
the above mentioned decorations will be retained in the custody 
of the Department of state until such time as the persons so 
honored may be in a position legally to accept them." 

, / , • . % • . • i* „ 

An officer of the Philippine Army is still considered to 
be a person holding an office of profit or trust under the 
United States and there would therefore be applicable to him 
the provision of the united States Constitution which in 
Section. 9, subsection 8, stipulates that 


"No person holding any office of profit or 
trust under them shall, without the consent 
of the Congress, accept of any present, 
emolument, office, or title of any kind what- 
ever from any king, prince or foreign state." 


General Valdes' decoration will therefore be retained in the 
custody of the Department of state until such time as its 
acceptance may be authorized by the Congress. 


Sincerely yours, 


For the Secretary of state: 


(Signed) R. Walton Moore 

Assistant Secretary 


The Honorable
