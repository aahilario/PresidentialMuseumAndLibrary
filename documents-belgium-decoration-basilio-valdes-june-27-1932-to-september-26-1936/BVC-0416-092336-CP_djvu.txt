For President Philippines, 

Manila, 

3, Reference your No. 598, paragraph 2, September 14th, , 
letter from State Department dated September 21, 1936, 
addressed to Acting Secretary of War, reads in part as 
follows ; (quote) 

"On August 26, 1933, the Secretary of State advised the 
Secretary of War of the receipt of certain decorations con- 
ferred by the King of the Belgians upon Lieutenant Colonel 
Basilio J. Valdes and certain other officers in the Philippine 
service, and stated that 'in accordance with existing legis- 
lation the above mentioned decorations will be retained in 
the custody of the Department of State until such time as the 
persons so honored may be in a position legally to accept 
them.’ (paragraph) 

An officer of the Philippine Aimy is still considered to 
be a person holding an office of profit or trust under the 
United States and there would therefore be applicable to him 
the provision of the United States Constitution which in section 
9, subsection 8, stimulates that ’no person holding any office 
of profit or trust under them shall, without the consent of 
the Congress, accept of any present, employment, office, or 
title of any kind whatever from any King, Prince or Foreign 
State.* (stop) General Valdes’ decoration will therefore be 
retained in the custody of the Department of State until such 
time as its acceptance may be authorized by the Congress."
