MY COUNTRYMEN: 



AS OP THE 21 ST OF SEPTEMBER, I SIGNED PROCLAMA- 
TION NO. 1081 PLACING THE ENTIRE PHILIPPINES UNDER 
MARTIAL LAW. THIS PROCLAMATION WAS TO BE IMPLEMEN- 
TED UPON MY CLEARANCE, AND CLEARANCE WAS 
GRANTED AT 9:00 IN THE EVENING OF THE 22ND OF 
SEPTEMBER. I HAVE PROCLAIMED MARTIAL LAW IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH POWERS VESTED IN THE PRESIDENT BY 
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE PHILIPPINES. 

THE PROCLAMATION OF MARTIAL LAW IS NOT A 
MILITARY TAKEOVER. I, AS YOUR DULY ELECTED 
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC, USE THIS POWER IMPLEMEN- 
TED BY THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES TO PROTECT THE 
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES AND OUR DEMOCRACY. A 
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC FORM OF GOVERNMENT IS 
NOT A HELPLESS GOVERNMENT. WHEN IT IS IMPERILLED 
BY THE DANGER OF A VIOLENT OVERTHROW, INSUR- 
RECTION AND REBELLION, IT HAS INHERENT AND BUILT-IN 
POWERS WISELY PROVIDED FOR UNDER THE CONSTITU- 
TION. SUCH A DANGER CONFRONTS THE REPUBLIC. 

THUS, ARTICLE VII, SECTION 10, PARAGRAPH (2) OF 
THE CONSTITUTION, PROVIDES: 

'THE PRESIDENT SHALL BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF 
OF ALL THE ARMED FORCES OF THE PHILIPPINES AND 
WHENEVER IT BECOMES NECESSARY HE MAY CALL 
OUT SUCH ARMED FORCES TO PREVENT OR SUPPRESS 
LAWLESS VIOLENCE, INVASION, INSURRECTION, OR 
REBELLION. IN CASE OF INVASION, INSURRECTION , OR 

1 



THE PUBi?r^J MMINENT DANGE R THEREOF, WHEN 
THE PR I VlLPr^ TY RE Q UIRES IT, HE MAY SUSPEND 
PLACE THE puuf ™ E WRIT ° F HABEAS CORPUS, OR 
UNDER MARTIAL law ° R **** ?ART THE * 

I REPEAT, THIS IS NOT A MILITARY TAKEOVER 0F 

™ L RP»r RNMENT FUNCTI0NS - THE ^VERNMENT OP 
THE REPUBLIC op 

^ OF THE PHILIPPINES WHICH WAS ESTAB- 
LISHED BY oiid 

nF]Jiriitc UR PEOp L E IN 1946 CONTINUES. THE 
OFFICIALS ANn v*.*, 

U EMPLOYEES OF OUR NATIONAL AND 

LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CONTINUE IN OFFICE AND MUST 
DISCHARGE THPir tm,~ 

UR D ^TIES AS BEFORE WITHIN THF LIMITS 
OF THE SITUATrnM ~ 

NATION. THIS WILL BE CLARIFIED BY MY 
SUBSEQUENT nD hPn 

ORDERS WHICH SHALL BE GIVEN WIDE 
PUBLICITY. (REFfr T ^ 

V tf ER TO GENERAL ORDER NO. 3) 

WE WILL EXPi au 

L ^fLAIN THE REQUIREMENTS AND STAN- 
DARDS OR DETAim 

rtlL -S AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. BUT ANY FORM 

OF CORRUPTION cm* 

x > CULPABLE NEGLIGENCE OR ARROGANCE 

WILL BE DEALT WITH 

IMMEDIATELY. 

THE ARMED Pad,. 

FORCES IS ALREADY CLEANING UP ITS 
OWN RANKS. I am ist« 

DIRECTING THE ORGANIZATION OF A 

MILITARY COMMISSION To INVESTIGATE, TRY AND PUNISH 
ALL MILITARY OFFENDERS IMMEDIATELY. FOR MORE 
THAN ANY OTHER jm SQLDlER MUST SET TH£ 

STANDARD OF NOBILITY. W E MUST BE COURAGEOUS BUT 
WE MUST BE HUMBLE AND ABOVE ALL WE MUST BE FAIR. 



2 



AS THIS IS TRUE OF THE SOLDIER, IT MUST BE TRUE OF 
THE CIVILIAN PUBLIC OFFICER. 

LET NO MAN WHO CLAIMS TO BE A FRIEND, RELATIVE 
OR ALLY PRESUME TO SEEK LICENSE BECAUSE OF THIS 
RELATIONSHIP. IF HE OFFENDS THE NEW SOCIETY, HE 
SHALL BE PUNISHED LIKE THE REST. 

PERSONS WHO HAVE NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO 
WITH SUCH CONSPIRACY AND OPERATIONS TO OVER- 
THROW THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES BY VIOLENCE 
HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR. THEY CAN MOVE ABOUT AND 
PERFORM THEIR DAILY ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ANY FEAR 
FROM THE GOVERNMENT AFTER THE PERIOD OF COUNTER- 
ACTION IS OVER. 

THE PERSONS WHO WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED 
ARE THOSE WHO HAVE ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN 'I HE 
CONSPIRACY AND OPERATIONS TO OVERTHROW THE DUi Y 
CONSTITUTED GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE 
PHILIPPINES BY VIOLENCE. 

BUT ALL PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES 
WHETHER OF THE NATIONAL OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
MUST CONDUCT THEMSELVES IN THE MANNER OF A NEW 
AND REFORMED SOCIETY. 

IN ADDITION TO THIS, I ISSUED GENERAL ORDERS FOR 
THE GOVERNMENT IN THE MEANTIME TO CONTROL MEDIA 
AND OTHER MEANS OF DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION 
AS WELL AS ALL PUBLIC UTILITIES. ALL SCHOOLS WILL BE 



3 



■ 



CLOSED FOR ONE WEEK BEGINNING THIS COMING MONDAY. 
THE CARRYING OF FIREARMS OUTSIDE RESIDENCES 
WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE 
PHILIPPINES IS PUNISHABLE WITH DEATH; CURFEW IS 
ESTABLISHED FROM TWELVE O'CLOCK MIDNIGHT TO FOUR 
O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING, THE DEPARTURE OF FILIPINOS 
ABROAD IS TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED; EXCEPTIONS ARE 
THOSE OF OFFICIAL MISSIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY 
CLEARANCES WILL BE GIVEN BY THE SECRETARY OF 
NATIONAL DEFENSE. IN THE MEANTIME, RALLIES, DEMONS- 
TRATIONS ARE PROHIBITED. SO TOO ARE STRIKES IN 
CRITICAL PUBLIC UTILITIES. 

I HAVE ORDERED THE ARREST OF THOSE DIRECTLY 
INVOLVED IN THE CONSPIRACY TO OVERTHROW OUR DULY 
CONSTITUTED GOVERNMENT BY VIOLENCE AND SUBVER 
SION. 

IT IS MY INTENTION BEGINNING TOMORROW TO ISSUE 
ALL THE ORDERS WHICH WOULD ATTAIN REFORMS IN OUR 
SOCIETY. 

THIS WOULD INCLUDE THE PROCLAMATION OF LAND 
REFORM ALL OVER THE PHILIPPINES, THE REORGANlZA 
TION OF THE GOVERNMENT, NEW RULES AND CONDUCT 
FOR THE CIVIL SERVICE, THE REMOVAL OF CORRUPT AND 
INEFFICIENT PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND THEIR 
REPLACEMENT AND THE BREAKING UP OF CRIMINAL 
SYNDICATES. 



4 



AGAIN I REPEAT -- THIS IS THE SAME GOVERNMENT 
THAT YOU -- THE PEOPLE ESTABLISHED IN 1946 UNDER 
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE PHILIPPINES. 

THERE IS NO DOUBT IN EVERYBODY'S MIND THAT A 
STATE OF REBELLION EXISTS IN THE PHILIPPINES. 

THE ORDINARY MAN IN THE STREETS, IN OUR CITIES, 
THE PEASANTS AND THE LABORERS KNOW IT. INDUSTRIA- 
LISTS KNOW IT. SO DO THE GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONARY. 
THEY HAVE ALL BEEN AFFECTED BY IT. THIS DANGER TO 
THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE EXISTENCE 
OF A REBELLION HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED EVEN BY OUR 
SUPREME COURT IN ITS DECISION IN THE CASE OF 
LANSANG VS. GARCIA, DATED DECEMBER 11, 1971. 

SINCE THE SUPREME COURT PROMULGATED THIS 
DECISION, THE DANGER HAS BECOME GRAVER AND 
REBELLION HAS WORSENED OR ESCALATED. IT HAS 
PARALYZED THE FUNCTIONS OF THE NATIONAL AND 
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE PRODUCTIVE SECTORS OF THE 
ECONOMY HAVE GROUNDED TO A HALT. MANY SCHOOLS 
HAVE CLOSED DOWN. THE JUDICIARY IS UNABLE TO 
ADMINISTER JUSTICE. MANY OF OUR BUSINESSMEN, 
TRADFRS, INDUSTRIALISTS, PRODUCERS AND MANUFACTU- 
RERS STOPPED THEIR OPERATIONS. IN THE GREATER 
MANILA AREA ALONE, TENSION AND ANXIETY HAVE 
REACHED A POINT WHERE THE CITIZENS ARE COMPELLED 
TO STAY AT HOME. LAWLESSNESS AND CRIMINALITY LIKE 



5 



KIDNAPPING, SMUGGLING, EXTORTION, BLACKMAIL, ARM El 
ROBBERY, ILLEGAL TRAFFIC IN DRUGS GUNRUNNING 
HOARDING AND MANIPULATION OF PRICES, CORRUP 
TION IN GOVERNMENT, TAX EVASION PERPETUATED BY 
SYNDICATED CRIMINALS, HAVE INCREASINGLY ESCALA- 
TED BEYOND THE CAPABILITY OF THE LOCAL POLICE AND 
CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES. 

THE USUALLY BUSY CENTERS OF THE AREA SUCH A! 
CINEMA HOUSES, SUPERMARKETS, RESTAURANTS, TRANS- 
PORTATION TERMINALS AND EVEN PUBLIC MARKETS ARE 
PRACTICALLY DESERTED. BATTLES ARE GOING ON BE- 
TWEEN THE ELEMENTS OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE 
PHILIPPINES AND THE SUBVERSIVES IN THE ISLAND OF 
LUZON AT ISABELA, ZAMBALES, TARLAC, CAMARINES SUR, 
QUEZON; AND IN THE ISLAND OF MINDANAO AT LANAO 
DEL SUR, LANAO DEL NORTE, ZAMBOANGA DEL SUR AND 
COTABATO. 

IF THIS CONTINUES EVEN AT THE PRESENT RATE, THE 

ECONOMY OF THE COUNTRY WILL COLLAPSE IN A SHORT 
TIME. 

*N ONE PROVINCE ALONE - ISABELA - WHERE THE 
COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE NEW PEOPLE'S ARMY HAVE 
SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH A RURAL SANCTUARY, THEY ARK 
NOW IN CONTROL OF 33 MUNICIPALITIES OUT OF 37. OTHER 
TOWNS ARE INFILTRATED SEVERELY BY THESE ARMED 
ELEMENTS. i N THIS PROVIN cE ALONE, THE SUPPOSED 



6 



INVISIBLE GOVERNMENT OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY HAS 
BEEN ORGANIZED THROUGH THE BARRIO ORGANIZING 
COMMITTEES (BOCs), TOTALLING 207 IN TWENTY FIVE (25) 
TOWNS, COMPARED TO 161 IN 12 TOWNS IN EARLY 1971. 

IN ADDITION TO THE BARRIO ORGANIZING COMMIT- 
TEES, THEY HAVE ALSO ORGANIZED THE BARRIO REVOLU- 
TIONARY COMMITrEES (BRCs). 

IN ANGADANAN AND CAUAYAN, ISABELA, THE NEW 
PEOPLE'S ARMY HAVE ESTABLISHED COMMUNAL FARMS 
AND PRODUCTION BASES. 

THE NEW PEOPLE'S ARMY HAS STARTED TO EXPAND 
ITS OPERATION TO CAGAYAN, NUEVA VIZCAYA AND 
QUIRINO AS WELL AS THE MOUNTAIN PROVINCES OF 
IFUGAO, KALINGA-APAYAO, BONTOC AND BENGUET. EVEN 
THE TWO I LOCOS PROVINCES AND LA UNION HAVE BEEN 
INFILTRATED. 

THE NEW PEOPLE'S ARMY AND THE COMMUNIST PARTY 
HAVE ALSO SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH IN A SIMILAR PATTERN, 
A RURAL SANCTUARY IN THE PROVINCE OF CAMARINES 
SUR AND ARE ATTEMPTING TO EXPAND INTO ALBAY, 

SORSOGON AND CAMARINES NORTE AS WELL AS QUEZON 
PROVINCE. 

THE ARMED ELEMENTS OF THE NEW PEOPLE'S ARMY 
UNDER THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE PHILIPPINES 
(MAOIST FACTION) HAVE INCREASED TO ABOUT 10,000, 
WHICH INCLUDES REGULARS AS WELL AS FARMERS IN TH E 



7 



DAYTIME AND SOLDIERS AT NIGHT. THIS IS AN INCREASE 
OF 100% IN A SHORT PERIOD OF SIX (6) MONTHS. IT HAS 
INCREASED ITS MASS BASE TO 100,000. THEIR FRONT 
ORGANIZATIONS OPERATIONS HAVE INCREASED TREMEN- 
DOUSLY. EXAMPLE OF SUCH A FRONT ORGANIZATION IS 
THE KABATAANG MAKABAYAN (KM), THE MOST MILITANT 
ORGANIZATION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY WHICH HAS 
INCREASED ITS CHAPTERS FROM 200 IN 1970 TO 317 UP TO 
THE END OF JULY 1972, AND ITS MEMBERSHIPS FROM 
10,000 IN 1970 TO 15,000 UP TO THE END OF JULY THIS 
YEAR. THE SAMAHANG DEMOKRATIKO NG KABATAAN 
(SDK) AN OUTSPOKEN FRONT ORGANIZATION HAD ALSO 
INCREASED ITS CHAPTERS FROM ALMOST NONE IN 1970 TO 
159 AT THE END OF JULY THIS YEAR AND HAS NOW 1,495 
HIGHLY INDOCTRINATED AND FANATICAL MEMBERS. 

THE CRUCIAL POINT WHICH INDICATES AN INCREASE 
IN THE CAPABILITY, THE AREA OF OPERATIONS AS WELL 
AS THE MANPOWER AND FIRE POWER OF THE NEW 
PEOPLE'S ARMY IS THE M/V KARAGATAN OR PALANAN 
INCIDENT IN PALANAN, ISABELA LAST JULY 4 AND 5, 1972. 
™ 1S WAS a LANDING BY AN OCEAN-GOING SHIP OF A 
REPORTED $,500 M-14 RIFLES OF WHICH ONLY ABOUT 900 
RE RE COVERED BY THE ARMED FORCES QF THE 
PHILIPPINES. ABOUT 30 ROCKET LAUNCHERS OF THE M-40 
VARIETY OF WHICH ONLY SIX (6) WERE RECOVERED FROM 
THE AREA. ALSO RECOVERED BY OUR FORCES WERE 



8 



160,000 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION, TWO (2) BROWNING 
AUTOMATIC RIFLES WHICH WERE ORIGINALLY LOOTED BY 
DEFECTOR VICTOR CORPUS FROM THE ARSENAL OF THE 
PHILIPPINE MILITARY ACADEMY, FIVE (5) GARAND M-l 
RIFLES, ONE (1) TELEPHONE SWITCH BOARD, SEVEN (7) 
TELEPHONE SETS, NUMEROUS M-14 MAGAZINES AND 
MANY REVEALING SUBVERSIVE DOCUMENTS. 

THE LANDING OF MILITARY ARMAMENTS AND EQUIP- 
MENT IN THE PALANAN INCIDENT, INDICATED: 

1) THAT THE CLAIM OF THE NEW PEOPLE'S ARMY 
THAT THEY ARE WELL- FUNDED HAS BASIS IN 
FACT; 

2) THAT THEY NOW HAVE SOURCES OF FUNDS AND 
EQUIPMENT NOT ONLY INSIDE THE PHILIPPINES 
BUT ALSO OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY; 

3) THAT THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE NEW 
PEOPLE'S ARMY ARE CAPABLE OF LANDING 
ARMAMENTS, MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND EVEN 
PERSONNEL IN MANY POINTS OF THE LONG SEA 
COAST OF THE PHILIPPINES WHICH IS TWICE THE 
SEA COAST OF THE UNITED STATES. 

THE DEFENSE ESTABLISHMENT HAS ADMITTED THAT 
THERE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTS TO INFILTRATE THE 
MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS THE OFFICE OF 
THE SECRETARY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE. THERE HAVE 
BEEN VARIOUS INCIDENTS OF ATTEMPTS TO SABOTAGE 



9 



NOT ONLY OPERATIONS OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE 

PHILIPPINES BUT THE OPERATIONS OF THE NATIONAL 

GOVERNMENT. 

IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS 

SYSTEM OF THE PHILIPPINE CONSTABULARY ARE BEING 
UTILIZED BY THE SUBVERSIVES. 

THE SUBVERSIVES HAVE ORGANIZED URBAN PARTI- 
SANS IN THE GREATER MANILA AREA. THEY HAVE BEEN 
AND STILL ARE ACTIVE. THEY HAVE SUCCEEDED IN SOME 
OF THEIR OBJECTIVES. 

THE VIOLENT DISORDER IN MINDANAO AND SULU HAS 
TO DATE RESULTED IN THE KILLING OF OVER 1,000 
CIVILIANS AND ABOUT 2,000 ARMED MUSLIMS AND 
CHRISTIANS, NOT TO MENTION THE MORE THAN FIVE 
HUNDRED THOUSANDS OF INJURED, DISPLACED AND 
HOMELESS PERSONS AS WELL AS THE GREAT NUMBER OF 
CASUALTIES AMONG OUR GOVERNMENT TROOPS AND THE 
PARALYZATION OF THE ECONOMY OF MINDANAO AND 



v ' ASSURE Y ° U ™ AT 1 AM FUSING THIS POWER 
VESTED IN ME BY THE CONSTITUTION TO SAVE THE 
REPUBLIC AND REFORM OUR SOCIETY, , WISH TO 
EMPHASIZE THESE TWO OBJECTIVES. WE WILL ELIMINATE 
THE THREAT OF A VIOLENT OVERTHROW OF OUR 
REPUBLIC. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST NOW REFORM 
THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS IN 



10 



OUR COUNTRY. THE PLANS AND ORDERS FOR REFORM TO 
REMOVE THE INEQUITIES OF THAT SOCIETY, THE CLEAN UP 
OF GOVERNMENT OF ITS CORRUPT AND STERILE ELE- 
MENTS, THE LIQUIDATION OF THE CRIMINAL SYNDICATES, 
THE SYSTEMATIC DEVELOPMENT OF OUR ECONOMY - THE 
GENERAL PROGRAM FOR A NEW AND BETTER PHILIPPINES 
— WILL BE EXPLAINED TO YOU. BUT WE MUST START OUT 
WITH THE REMOVAL OF ANARCHY AND THE MAINTENANCE 
OF PEACE AND ORDER. 

I HAVE HAD TO USE THIS CONSTITUTIONAL POWER IN 
ORDER THAT WE MAY NOT COMPLETELY LOSE THE CIVIL 
RIGHTS AND FREEDOM WHICH WE CHERISH. I ASSURE YOU 
THAT THIS IS NOT A PRECIPITATE DECISION - THAT I HAVE 
WEIGHED ALL THE FACTORS. IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER 
SOLUTION AT OUR DISPOSAL AND WITHIN OUR CAPABILITY 
WHICH WE COULD UTILIZE TO SOLVE THE PRESENT 
PROBLEM I WOULD CHOOSE IT. BUT THERE IS NONE. 

I HAVE USED THE OTHER TWO ALTERNATIVES OF 
CALLING OUT THE TROOPS TO QUELL THE REBELLION AND 
SUSPENDING THE PRIVILEGE OF THE WRIT OF HABEAS 
CORPUS. BUT THE REBELLION HAS NOT BEEN STOPPED. 1 
REPEAT IT HAS WORSENED. THUS IT WAS DISCOVERED 
THAT WHEN THE SUSPENSION OF THE PRIVILEGE OF THE 
WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS WAS LIFTED ON JANUARY U, 
1972, THE ORGANIZATION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY HAD 
EXPANDED THEIR AREA OF OPERATION AS WELL AS 



11 



INCREASED THEIR MEMBERSHIPS. 

ALL OTHER RECOURSES HAVE BEEN UNAVAILING. 
YOU ARE ALL WITNESSES TO THESE. SO WE HAVE FALLEN 
ON OUR LAST LINE OF DEFENSE. 

YOU ARE WITNESSES TO THE PATIENCE THAT WE HAVE 
SHOWN IN THE FACE OF PROVOCATION. IN THE FACE OF 
ABUSE AND LICENSE WE HAVE USED PERSUASION. NOW 

THE LIMIT HA? dut^. 

nab B EEN REACHED. WE ARE AGAINST THE 

WALL. WE MUST NOW DEFEND THE REPUBLIC WITH THE 
STRONGER POWERS OF THE CONSTITUTION. 

TO THOSE GUILTY OF TREASON, INSURRECTION, 
REBELLION, IT MAY POSE A GRAVE DANGER. BUT TO THE 
CITIZENRY WHOSE PRIMARY CONCERN I S ' TO BE LEFT 
ALONE TO PURSUE THEIR LAWFUL ACTIVITIES THIS IS THE 
GUARANTY OF THAT. FREEDOM. 

ALL THAT WE DO IS FOR THE REPUBLIC AND FOR YOU. 
REST ASSURED WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. 

COn' HAVE PRAYED T ° GUIDANCE - LET US ALL 

^ONTINUE TO DO SO. I AM CONFIDENT THAT WITH GODS 

snr J E WILl ATTAIN OUR DREAM OF A REFORMED 
SOCIETY, A NEW AND BRIGHTER WORLD.

PROCLAMATION NO. 1081 



PROCLAIMING A STATE OF MARTIAL LAW 
IN THE PHILIPPINES 

WHEREAS, on the basis of carefully evaluated and verified in- 
formation, it is definitely established that lawless elements who are 
moved by a common or similar ideological conviction, design, strate- 
gy and goal and enjoying the active moral and material support of a 
foreign power and being guided and directed by intensely devoted, 
well trained, determined and ruthless groups of men and seeking 
refuge under the protection of our constitutional liberties to pro- 
mote and attain their ends, have entered into a conspiracy and have 
in fact joined and banded their resources and forces together for the 
prime purpose of, and in fact they have been and are actually staging, 
undertaking and waging an armed insurrection and rebellion against 
the Government of the Republic of the Philippines in order to forcib- 
ly seize political and state power in this country, overthrow the duly 
constituted government, and supplant our existing political, social, 
economic and legal order with an entirely new one whose form of 
government, whose system of laws, whose conception of God and 
religion, whose notion of individual rights and family relations, and 
whose political, social, economic, legal and moral precepts are based 
on the Mar xist-Leninist-Maoist teachings and beliefs; 

WHEREAS, these lawless elements, acting in concert through 
seemingly innocent and harmless, although actually destructive, front 
organizations which have been infiltrated or deliberately formed by 



13 



them, have continuously and systematically strengthened and 
broadened their memberships through sustained and careful recruit- 
ing and enlistment of new adherents from among our peasantry, 
laborers, professionals, intellectuals, students, and mass media per- 
sonnel, and through such sustained and careful recruitment and en- 
listment have succeeded in spreading and expanding their control and 
influence over almost every segment and level of our society through- 
out the land in their ceaseless effort to erode and weaken the politi- 
cal, social, economic, legal and moral foundations of our existing 
government, and to influence, manipulate and move peasant, labor, 
student and terroristic organizations under their influence or control 
t0 comm,t » as in fact they have committed and still are committing, 
acts of violence, depredations, sabotage and injuries against our duly 
constituted authorities, against the members of our law enforcement 

agencies, an d worst of all, against the peaceful members of our so- 
ciety; 

WHEREAS, in the fanatical pursuit of their conspiracy and 

acts of violence, depredations, sabotage and injuries 

° Ur people ' an d in order to provide the essential instrument 
to direct and 

carry out their criminal design and unlawful activities, 

*° ach,eve their ultimate sinister objectives, these lawless ele- 
ments have in f->^* 

,n T act organized, established and are now maintaining a 
Central Committee, composed of young and dedicated radical stu- 
dents and intellectuals, which is charged with guiding and directing 
the armed struggle and propaganda assaults against our duly constitu- 
ted government, and this Central Committee is now imposing its will 



14 



and asserting its sham authority on certain segments of our 
population, especially in the rural areas, through varied means of 
subterfuge, deceit, coercion, threats, intimidations, machinations, 
treachery, violence and other modes of terror, and has been and is 
illegally exacting financial and other forms of tributes from our peo- 
ple to raise funds and material resources to support its insur- 
rectionary and propaganda activities against our duly constituted 
government and against our peace-loving people; 

WHEREAS, in order to carry out, as in fact they have carried 
out, their premeditated plan to stage, undertake and wage a full scale 
armed insurrection and rebellion in this country, these lawless ele- 
ments have organized, established and are now maintaining a well 
trained, well armed and highly indoctrinated and greatly expanded 
insurrectionary force, popularly known as the "New People's Army", 
which has since vigorously pursued and still is vigorously pursuing a 
relentless and ruthless armed struggle against our duly constituted 
government and whose unmitigated forays, raids, ambuscades, as- 
saults and reign of terror and acts of lawlessness in the rural areas and 
in our urban centers brought about the treacherous and cold-blooded 
assassination of innocent civilians, military personnel of the govern- 
ment and local public officials in many parts of the country, notably 
in the Cagayan Valley, in Central Luzon, in the Southern Tagalog 
Region, in the Bicol Area, in the Visayas and in Mindanao, and 
whose daring and wanton guerrilla activities have generated and sown 
fear and panic among our people, have created a climate of chao* and 
disorder, produced a state of political, social, psychofogica/aWd eco- 



15 



nomic instability in our land, and have inflicted great suffering and 
irreparable injury to persons and property in our society; 

WHEREAS, these lawless elements, their cadres, fellow-travel- 
lers, friends, sympathizers and supporters have for many years up to 
the present time been mounting sustained, massive and destructive 
propaganda assaults against our duly constituted government, its ins- 
trumentalities, agencies and officials, and also against our social, po- 
litical, economic and religious institutions, through the publications, 
broadcasts and disseminations of deliberately slanted and overly 
exaggerated news stories and news commentaries as well as false, vile, 
foul and scurrilous statements, utterances, writings and pictures 
through the press-radio-television media and through leaflets, college 
campus newspapers and some newspapers published and still being 
Published by these lawless elements, notably the "Ang Bayan", M Pu- 
>ang Bandila" and the "Ang Komunista", all of which are clearly 
well-conceived, intended and calculated to malign and discredit our 
d "ly constituted government, its instrumentalities, agencies and of- 
ficials before our people, making it appear to the people that our 
government has become so weak and so impotent to perform and 
discharge its functions and responsibilities in our society an d to our 
People, and thus undermine and destroy the faith and loyalty and 
allegiance of our people in and alienate their support for their duly 
constituted government, its instrumentalities, agencies and officials, 
and thereby gradually erode, and weaken as in fact they have so 
eroded and weakened the will of our people to sustain and defend 
our government and our democratic way of life; 



16 



WHEREAS, these lawless elements having taken up arms against 
our duly constituted government and against our people, and having 
committed and are still committing acts of armed insurrection and 
rebellion consisting of armed raids, forays, sorties, ambushes, wanton 
acts of murders, spoilage, plunder, looting, arsons, destruction of 
public and private buildings, and attacks against innocent and de- 
fenseless civilian lives and property, all of which activities have se- 
riously endangered and continue to endanger public order and safety 
and the security of the nation, and acting with cunning and manifest 
precision and deliberation and without regard to the health, safety 
and well-being of the people, are now implementing their plan to 
cause widespread, massive and systematic destruction and paraliza- 
tion of vital public utilities and services, particularly water systems, 
sources of electrical power, communication and transportation facili- 
ties, to the great detriment, suffering, injury and prejudice of our 
people and the nation and to generate a deep psychological fear and 
panic among our people; 

WHEREAS, the Supreme Court in the cases brought before it, 
docketed as G.R. Nos, L-33964, L-33965, L-33973, L-33982, 
L-34004, L^34013, L-34039, L- 34265, and L-34339, as a conse- 
quence of the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus 
by me as President of the Philippine* in my Proclamation No. 889, 
dated August 21, 1971, as amended, has found that in truth and in 
fact there exists an actual insurrection and rebellion in the country 
by a sizeable group of men who have publicly risen in arms to over- 
throw the government- Here is what the Supreme Court said in its 



17 



decision promulgated on December 11, 1971 : 

"x x x our jurisprudence attests abundantly to the 
Communist activities in the Philippines, especially in 
Manila, from the late twenties to the early thirties, then 
aimed principally at incitement to sedition or rebellion, as 
the immediate objective. Upon the establishment of the 
Commonwealth of the Philippines, the movement seemed 
to have waned notably; but, the outbreak of World War II 
in the Pacific and the miseries, the devastation and havoc, 
and the proliferation of unlicensed firearms concomitant 
with the military occupation of the Philippines and its 
subsequent liberation, brought about, in the late forties, a 
resurgence of the Communist threat, with such vigor as to 
be able to organize and operate in Central Luzon an army 
- called HUKBALAHAP, during the occupation, and re- 
named Hukbong Mapagpalaya.ng Bayan (HMB) after libe- 
ration - which clashed several times with the armed forces 
°f the Republic. This prompted then President Quirino to 
'ssue Proclamation No. 210, dated October 22, 1950, sus- 
pending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, the 
validity of which was upheld in Montenegro v. Castafieda. 

ays before the promulgation of said Proclamation, or on 
October 18, 1950, members of the Communist Politburo 
,n the Philippines were apprehended in Manila, Subse- 
quently accused and convicted of the crime of rebellion, 
they served their respective sentences.

"The fifties saw a comparative lull in Communist acti- 
vities, insofar as peace and order were concerned. Still, on 
June 20, 1957, Republic Act No. 1700, otherwise known 
as the Anti-Subversion Act, was approved, upon the 
grounds stated in the very preamble of said statute - that 
**x x x the Communist Party of the Philippines, 
although purportedly a political party, is in fact an 
organized conspiracy to overthrow the Government 
of the Republic of the Philippines, not only by force 
and violence but also by deceit, subversion and other 
illegal means, for the purpose of establishing in the 
Philippines a totalitarian regime subject to alien domi- 
nation and control; 

"x x x the continued existence and activities of 
the Communist Party of the Philippines constitutes a 
deor, present and grave danger to the security of the 
Philippines; and 

"x x x in the fact of the organized, systematic 
and persistent subversion, national in scope but inter- 
national in direction, posed by the Communist Party 
of the Philippines and its activities, there is urgent 
need for special legislation to cope with this con- 
tinuing menace to the freedom and security of the 
country x x x." 

In the language of the Report on Central Luzon, sub- 
mitted, on September 4, 1971, by the Senate Ad Hoc 



19 



Committee of Seven— copy of which Report was filed in 
these cases by the petitioners herein— 

"The years following 1963 saw the successive 

emergence in the country of several mass organiza- 
tions, notably the Lapiang Manggagawa (now the So- 
cialist Party of the Philippines) among the workers; 
the Malayang Samahan ng Mga Magsasaka (MASAKA) 
among the peasantry; the Kabataang Makabayan 
(KM) among the youth/students; and the Movement 
for the Advancement of Nationalism (MAN) among 
the intellectuals/professionals, the PKP has exerted 
all-out effort to infiltrate, influence and utilize these 
organizations in promoting its radical brand of na- 
tionalism." 

Meanwhile, the Communist leaders in the Philippines 
had been split into two (2) groups, one of which - com- 
posed mainly of young radicals, constituting the Maoist 
factton - reorganized the Communist Party of the Philip- 
Pines early in 1969 and established a New People's Army. 
This faction adheres to the Maoist concept of the "Protrac- 
* ed People's War' or 'War of National Liberation.' Its 

'Programme for a People's Democratic Revolution' states, 
intergfia: 

"The Communist Party of the Philippines is de- 
termined to implement its general programme for a 
people's democratic revolution. All Filipino com- 



20 



munists are ready to sacrifice their lives for the 
worthy cause of achieving the new type of democra- 
cy, of building a new Philippines that is genuinely and 
completely independent, democratic, united, just and 
prosperous. . . 

XXX XXX XXX 

'The Central task of any revolutionary move- 
ment is to seize political power. The Communist 
Party of the Philippines assumes this task at a time 
that both the international and national situations are 
favorable to taking the road of armed revolution. . / 

"In the year 1969, the NPA had-according to the 
records of the Department of National Defense-conducted 
raids, resorted to kidnappings and taken part in other 
violent incidents numbering over 230, in which it inflicted 
404 casualties, and, in turn, suffered 243 losses. In 1970, 
its record of violent incidents was about the same, but the 
NPA casualties more than doubled. 

"At any rate, two (2) facts are undeniable: (a) all 
Communists, whether they belong to the traditional group 
or to the Maoist faction, believe that force and violence are 
indispensable to the attainment of their main and ultimate 
objective, and act in accordance with such belief, although 
they disagree on the means to be used at a given time and 
in a particular place; and (b) there is a New People's Army, 



21 



other, of course, than the armed forces of the Republic 
and antagonistic thereto. Such New People's Army is per 
se proof of the existence of a rebellion, especially consider- 
ing that its establishment was announced publ icly by the 
reorganized C PP. Such announcement is in the nature of a 
Public challenge to the duly constituted authorities and 
may be likened to a declaration of war, sufficient to estab- 
lish a war status or a co nd iti on of belligerency, even before 
the actual commencement of hostilities. 

"We entertain, therefore, no doubts about the 
existence of a sizeable group of men who have publicly 
risen in a ^ms to overthrow the government and have thus 
been and still are engaged in rebellion against the Gov- 
ernment of the Philippines. 

ERE AS, these lawless elements have to a considerable ex- 
tent sue 

et * m impeding our duly constituted authorities from 

ng their functions and discharging their duties and responsi- 
bilities in 

accordance with our laws and our Constitution to the great 

damage 

' pre ' udi ce and detriment of the people and the nation; 

ERe AS, it is evident that there is throughout the land a 
te of anarrh 

rcny and lawlessness, chaos and disorder, turmoil and 

^ruction of * 

a magnitude equivalent to an actual war between the 
forces of 0Ur . t 

^ au| y constituted government and the New People's 

an their satellite organizations because of the unmitigated 
forays, raids, ambuscades, assaults, violence, murders, assassinations,

I 

acts of terror, deceits, coercions, threats, intimidations, treachery, 
machinations, arsons, plunders and depredations committed and 
being committed by the aforesaid lawless elements who have pledged 
to the whole nation that they will not stop their dastardly effort and 
scheme until and unless they have fully attained their primary and 
ultimate purpose of forcibly seizing political and state power in this 
country by overthrowing our present duly constituted government, 
by destroying our democratic way of life and our established secular 
and religious institutions and beliefs, and by supplanting our existing 
political, social, economic, legal and moral order with an entirely 
new one whose form of government, whose notion of individual 
rights and family relations, and whose political, social, economic and 
moral precepts are based on the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist teaching$ 
and beliefs; 

WHEREAS, the Supreme Court in its said decision concluded 
that the unlawful activities of the aforesaid lawless elements actually 
pose a clear, present and grave danger to public safety and the se- 
curity of the nation and in support of that conclusion found that: 

<x x x the Executive had information and reports— sub- 
sequently confirmed, in many respects, by the above-mentioned 
Report of the Senate Ad Hoc Committee of Seven - to the 
effect that the Communist Party of the Philippines does not 
merely adhere to Lenin's idea of a swift armed uprising; that it 
has, also, adopted Ho Chi Minh's terrorist tactics and resorted 
to the assassination of uncooperative focal officials; that, in line 
with this policy, the insurgents have killed 5 mayors, 20 barrio 



23 



captains and 3 chiefs of police; that there were fourteen {14} 

•meaningful bombing incidents in the Greater Manila area in 

1970; that the Constitutional Convention Hall was bombed on 

June 12, 1971; that, soon after the Plaza Miranda incident, the 

N AW ASA main pipe at the Quezon City - San Juan boundary, 

Was bombed; that this was followed closely by the bombing of 

the Manila City Hall, the COMELEC Building, the Congress 

Gilding and the MERALCOsub-station at Cubao, Quezon City; 

ar, d that the respective residences of Senator Jose J. Roy 

a0d C °ng<-essman Eduardo Cojuangco were, likewise, bombed, 

as *eretheMERALCO office premises, along Ortigas 

Avenue, and the Doctor's Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Building, in 
Caloocan City. 

x x x the reorganized Communist Party of the Philippines 
' mot "eover, adopted Mao's concept of protracted people's 

War 

' a,me d at the paralyzation of the will to resist of the gov- 

nrnent| °* the political, economic and inteHectuaf leaderships 
and of th 

L "e people themselves; that conformably to such con- 
cept the P 

' Party has placed special emphasis upon a most exten- 
sive and . 

In ^nsive program of subversion by the establishment 

Of front 

organizations in urban centers, the organization of 
city Partisans and the infiltration in student groups, labor 
m °n$ f and farmer and professional groups; that the CPP has 
mar *aged to infiltrate or establish and control nine (9) major 
labor organizations; that it has exploited the youth movement 
and succeeded in making Communist fronts of eleven (11) 
major student or youth organizations; that ihere are, according- 

24 



ly, about thirty (30) mass organizations actively advancing the 
CPP interests, among which are the Malayang Samahan ng Mag- 
sasaka (MASAKA), the Kabataang Makabayan (KM), the Move- 
ment for the Advancement of Nationalism (MAN), the 
Samahang Demokratiko ng Kabataan (SDK), the Samahang Mo- 
lave (SM), and the Malayang Pagkakaisa ng Kabataang Pilipino 
(MPKP); that, as of August, 1971, the KM had two hundred 
forty-five (245) operational chapters throughout the Philip- 
pines, of which seventy -three (73) were in the Greater Manila 
Area, sixty (60) in Northern Luzon, forty nine (49) in Central 
Luzon, forty-two (42) in the Visayas and twenty-one (21) in 
Mindanao and Sulu; that in 1970, the Party had recorded two 
hundred fifty -eight (258) major demonstrations, of which about 
thirty-three (33) ended in violence, resulting in fifteen (15) 
killed and over five hundred (500) injured; that most of these 
actions were organized, coordinated or led by the afore- 
mentioned front organizations; that the violent demonstrations 
were generally instigated by a small, but well-trained group of 
armed agitators; that the number of demonstrations heretofore 
staged in 1971 has already exceeded those of 1970; and that 
twenty-four (24) G f these demonstrations were violent, and re^ 
suited in the death of fifteen (15) persons and the injury of 
many more. 

"Subsequent events x x x have also proven x x x the threat 
to public safety p 0sed b y the New People's Army. Indeed, it 
appears that, since August 21, 1971, it had in Northern Luzon 



25 



six (6) encounters and staged one (1 ) raid, in consequences of 
which seven (7) soldiers lost their lives and two (2) others were 
wounded, whereas the insurgents suffered five (5) casualties; 
that on August 26, 1971, a well-armed group of NPA, trained 
by defector Lt. Victor Corpus, attacked the very command post 
of TF LA WIN in Isabela, destroying two (2) helicopters and one 
(1) plane, and wounding one (1) soldier; that the NPA had in 
Central Luzon a total of four (4) encounters, with two (2) 
killed and three (3) wounded on the side of the Government, 
one (1) BSDU killed and three (3) KM-SDK leader, an unidenti- 
fied dissident, and Commander Panchito, leader of the dissident 
group were killed; that on August 26, 1971, there was an en- 
counter in the barrio of San Pedro, Iriga City, Camarines Sur, 
«ween the PC and the NPA, in which a PC and two (2) KM 
^embers were killed, that the current disturbances in Cotabato 

the ' 6 Una ° Pr ° VinCeS have been re ndered more complex by 
e '"volvement of the CPP/NPA, for, in mid-1971, a KM 
group, headcH k 

uea D y Jovencio Esparagoza, contacted the Higa-onan 
tribes i n t u • 

offe ' settlement in Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental, and 

e them books, pamphlets and brochures of Mao Tse Tung, 
<*s well 

was Conducte d teach-ins in the reservation ; that Esparagoza 

reportedly killed on September 22, 1971, in an operation 
' th e pr :„ „ . . 
NPA reservation; and that there are now two (2) 

Acad resi n Mindanao. 
f ll should, also, be noted that adherents of the CPP and its 
organizations are, according to intelligence findings, de- 



26 



finitely capable of preparing powerful explosives out of locally 
available materials; that the bomb used in the Constitutional 
Convention Hall was a 'Claymore' mine, a powerful explosive 
device used by the U.S. Army, believed to have been one of 
many pilfered from the Subic Naval Base a few days before; 
that the President had received intelligence information to the 
effect that there was a July-August Plan involving a wave of 
assassinations, kidnappings, terrorism and mass destruction of 
property and that an extraordinary occurrence would signal the 
beginning of said event; that the rather serious condition of 
peace and order in Mindanao, particularly in Cotabato and 
Lanao, demanded the presence therein of forces sufficient to 
cope with the situation; that a sizeable part of our armed forces 
discharges other functions; and that the expansion of the CPP 
activities from Central Luzon to other parts of the country, 
particularly Manila and its suburbs, the Cagayan Valley, Ifugao, 
Zambales, Laguna, Quezon and the Bicol Region, required that 
the rest of our armed forces be spread thin over a wide area." 
WHEREAS, in the unwavering prosecution of their revolutio- 
nary war against the Filipino people and their duly constituted gov- 
ernment, the aforesaid lawless elements have, in the months of May, 
June and July, 1972> succeec j e d in bringing and introducing into the 
country at Di goyo p ojn ^ Pa | ana n, Isabela and at other undetermined 
points along the p acifjc coast line of Luzon, a substantial quantity of 
war material consisting of M-14 rifles estimated to be some 3,500 
pieces, several dozens of 40 mm rocket launchers which are said to 



27 



be Chicom copies of a Russian prototype rocket launcher, large 
quantities of 80 mm rockets and ammunitions, and other combat 
paraphernalia, of which war material some had been discovered and 
captured by government military forces, and the bringing and intro- 
duction of such quantity and type of war material into the country is 
a mute but eloquent proof of the sinister plan of the aforesaid law- 
less elements to hasten the escalation of their present revolutionary 
war against the Filipino people and their legitimate government; 

WHEREAS, in the execution of their overall revolutionary plan, 
the aforesaid lawless elements have prepared and released to their 
various field commanders and Party workers a document captioned 
"REGIONAL PROGRAM OF ACTION 1972", a copy of which was 
captured by elements of the 116th and 119th Philippine Consta- 
bula ry Companies on June 18, 1972 at Barrio Taringsing, Cordon,

"CENTRAL COMMITTEE 
COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE 

PHILIPPINES" 

WHEREAS, in line with their "REGIONAL PROGRAM OF 
ACTION 1972", the aforesaid lawless elements have of late been 
conducting intensified acts of violence and terrorisms during the cur- 
rent year in the greater Manila area such as the bombing of the Area 
building at Taft Avenue, Pasay City, on March 15; of the Filipinas 
Orient Airways board room at Domestic Road, Pasay City on April 
23; of the Vietnamese Embassy on May 30; of the Court of Indus- 
trial Relations on June 23; of the Philippine Trust Company branch 
office in Cubao, Quezon City on June 24; of the Philamlife building 
at United Nations Avenue, Manila, on July 3; of the Tabacalera Cigar 
& Cigarette Factory Compound at Marquez de Comillas, Manila on 
July 27; of the PLOT exchange office at East Avenue, Quezon City, 
and of the Philippine Sugar Institute building at North Avenue, 
DiMman, Quezon City, both on August 15; of the Department of 



31 



Social Welfare building at San Rafael Street, Sampaloc, Manila, on 
August 17; of a water main on Aurora Boulevard and Madison 
Avenue, Quezon City on August 19; of the Philamlife building again 
on August 30; this time causing severe destruction on the Far East 
Bank and Trust Company building nearby; of the armored car and 
building of the Philippine Banking Corporation as well as the build- 
ings of the Investment Development Inc. and the Daily Star Publica- 
tions when another explosion took place on Railroad Street, Port 
Area, Manila also on August 30; of Joe's Department Store on Car- 
nedo Street, Quiapo, Manila, on September 5, causing death to one 
woman and injuries to some 38 individuals; and of the City Hall of 
Manila on September 8; of the watermains in San Juan, Rizal on 
S?PLJ_2, of the San Miguel building in Makati, Rizal on Sept. 1 4; 
and of the Quezon City Hall on September 18, 1972, as well as the 
attempted bombing of the Congress Building on July 18, when an 
unexploded bomb was found in the Senate Publication Division and 

the atte "ipted bombing of the Department of Foreign Affairs on 
August 30. 

WHEREAS, in line with the same "REGIONAL PROGRAM OF 
ACTION 1972", the aforesaid lawless elements have also fielded in 
the Greater Manila area several of their "Sparrow Units" or "Simbad 
Units to undertake liquidation missions against ranking government 
officials, military personnel and prominent citizens and to further 
heighten the destructions and depredations already inflicted by them 
upon our innocent people, all of which are being deliberately done to 



32 



sow terror, fear and chaos amongst our population and to make the 
government look so helpless and incapable of protecting the lives and 
property of our people; 

WHEREAS, in addition to the above-described social disorder, 
there is also the equally serious disorder in Mindanao and Sulu result- 
ing from the unsettled conflict between certain elements of the 
Christian and Muslim population of Mindanao and Sulu, between the 
Christian "llagas" and the Muslim "Barracudas", and between our 
government troops, and certain lawless organizations such as the 
Mindanao Independence Movement; 

WHEREAS, the Mindanao Independence Movement with the 
active material and financial assistance of foreign political and econo- 
mic interests, is engaged in an open and unconcealed attempt to 
establish by violence and force a separate and independent political 
state out of the islands of Mindanao and Sulu which are historically, 
politically and by law parts of the territories and within the jurisdic- 
tion and sovereignty of the Republic of the Philippines; 

WHEREAS, because of the aforesaid disorder resulting from 
armed clashes, killings, massacres, arsons, rapes, pillages, destruction 
of whole villages and towns and the inevitable cessation of agricul- 
tural and industrial operations, all of which have been brought about 
by the violence inflicted by the Christians, the Muslims, the M llagas", 
the "Barracudas", a nd the Mindanao Independence Movement 
against each other and against our government troops, a great many 
parts of the islands of Mindanao and Sulu are virtually now in a state 
of actual war; 



33 



WHEREAS, the violent disorder in Mindanao and Sulu has to- 
date resulted in the killing of over 1,000 civilians and about 2,000 
armed muslims and christians, not to mention the more than five 
hundred thousand of injured, displaced and homeless persons as well 
as the great number of casualties among our government troops, and 
the paralyzation of the economy of Mindanao and Sulu; 

WHEREAS, because of the foregoing acts of armed insurrec- 
tion, wanton destruction of human lives and property, unabated and 
unrestrained propaganda attacks against the government and its insti- 
tutions, instrumentalities, agencies and officials, and the rapidly ex- 
panding ranks of the aforesaid lawless elements, and because of the 
spreading lawlessness and anarchy throughout the land, all of which 
have prevented the government to exercise its authority, extend to 
■ts citizenry the protection of its laws and in general exercise its 
sovereignty over all of its territories, caused serious demoralization 

among our people and have made the public apprehensive and fear- 
f u I 

u » and finally because public order and safety and the security of 
th ' S nation de mand that immediate, swift, decisive and effective 
action be taken to protect and insure the peace, order and security of 
country and its population and to maintain the authority of the 
government; 

WHEREAS, in cases of invasion, insurrection or rebellion or 
imminent danger thereof, I, « President of the Philippines, have, 
under the Constitution, three courses of action open to me, namely: 
(a) call out the armed forces to suppress the present lawless violence; 



34 



(b) suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus to make the 
arrest and apprehension of these lawless elements easier and more 
effective; or (c) place the Philippines or any part thereof under mar- 
tial law; 

WHEREAS, I have already utilized the first two courses of 
action, first, by calling upon the armed forces to suppress the afore- 
said lawless violence, committing to that specific job almost 50% of 
the entire armed forces of the country and creating several task 
forces for that purpose such as Task Force Saranay, Task Force 
Palanan, Task Force Isarog, Task Force Pagkakaisa and Task Force 
Lancaf, and, second, by suspending the privilege of the writ of 
habeas corpus on August 21, 1971 up to January 11, 1972, but 
inspite of all that, both courses of action were found inadequate and 
ineffective to contain, much less solve, the present rebellion and 
lawlessness in the country as shown by the fact that: 

1. The radical left has increased the number and area of 
operation of its front organ izat tons and has intensified the 
recruitment and training of new adherents in the urban 
and rural areas especially from among the youth; 

2, The Kabataang Makabayan (KM), the most militant and 
outspoken front organization of the radical left, has in- 
creased the number of its chapters from 200 as of the end 
of 1970 to 317 as of July 31, 1972 and its membership 
from 10,000 as of the end of 1 970 to 1 5,000 as of the end 
of July, 1972, showing very clearly the rapid growth of the 



35 



communist movement in this country; 
The Samahang Demokratiko Ng Kabataan (SDK), another 
militant and outspoken front organization of the radical 
left, has also increased the number of its chapters from an 
insignificant number at the end of 1970 to 159 as of the 
end of July, 1972 and has now a membership of some 
1,495 highly indoctrinated, intensely committed and 
almost fanatically devoted individuals; 

The New People's Army, the most active and the most 
violent and ruthless military arm of the radical left, has 
increased its total strength from an estimated 6,500 (com- 
posed of 560 regulars, 1 ,500 combat support and 4,400 
service support) as of January 1, 1972 to about 7,900 
{composed of 1,028 regulars, 1,800 combat support and 
5,025 service support) as of July 31, 1972, showing a 
marked increase in its regular troops of over 100% in such 
a short period of six months; 

The establishment of sanctuaries for the insurgents in 
Isabela, in Zam bales, in Ca marines Sur, and in some parts 
of Mindanao, a development heretofore unknown in our 
campaign against subversion and insurgency in this coun- 
try; 

The disappearance and dropping out of school of some 
3,000 high school and college students and who are report- 
ed to have joined with the insurgents for training in the 
handling of firearms and explosives; 



36 



7. The bringing and introduction into the country of substan- 
tial war material consisting of military hardware and sup- 
plies through the MV Karagatan at Digoyo Point, Palanan, 
Isabela, and the fact that many of these military hardware 
and supplies are now in the hands of the insurgents and are 
being used against our government troops; 

8. The infiltration and control of the media by persons who 
are sympathetic to the insurgents and the consequent in- 
tensification of their propaganda assault against the gov- 
ernment and the military establishment of the government; 

9. The formation of the grass-root level of "political power 
organs", heretofore unknown in the history of the Com-
