capacity to be corrupted even by *»***®“ . , 

No one deserved that fame more f 'o 

for her life was an immolation to an ideal 
But always, it was a life pushed selflessly in

ATROCITY COMPOUNDED 
The nation is in niourniiif? today 
at the death of a ^rcai lady. 

It is more than shocked at the 
nature of her death, and that of 
close members of her family and 
others in the amlniscade that 
ended the life of Aurora Aragon 
Quezon. 

There is a revulsion of the na- 
tional spirit at the perpetrators 
of the crime. There can be no 
doubt that they were Hukbala- 
haps. The general knowledge of 
the advent of Mrs. Quezon and 
her party to Baler makes it seem 
unlikely that the ambush was less 
than intentional and planned. The , 
news had been broadcast and an- 
nounced in. thQ press and the wel- ^ 
come signs were up. 

The people of the country liard- ; 
ly knew how much they revered 
and respected the widow of the • 
hile Prosideot Quezon. Her quiet ; 
influence for good, her conscien- 
tious and effective work on behalf 
of the R(hI Cross, her concern for , 
the people and the beautiful grace ; 
with which advancing years rested j 
upon her had made her more of a , 
national symbol than i>erhaps she 
herself realized. 

It took sudden death to bring 
about a realization of her position 
in the land. In reality it >^as that 
of First L.ady, both yesterday and 
today. And it seemed to require 
an atrocity of the magnitude of 
yesterday’s to bring the people to 
full realization of the desperate 
wickedness and senseless bravado 
of those who call themselves 
. Huks, they and their misguided 
followers. 

XheiH; seems no alternative now 
to a determined pursuit and liqui- 
dation of the dissidents of central 
Euzon. They have finally com- 
mitted the unpardonable ^n. 
There may have been a residual 
sympathy for the Huks because 
of their economic underprivilege, 


^ but when they seek to call na- 1 

tlonal attention to their plight by 
' lliiown far and wide as a per- deliberately destroying a national-; 

non tvhose heart, like, tliat of her - ly-loved symbol of decency, of 
distinguished husband/ welled up goo<l deeds, of long-loved tradi- 


^vith compassion for our oeivi - tion and of the highest feminine 

dcred masses, her sudden death virtue, then the law-abiding peo- 

at the hands of law ess ^ ® V 1’^^ have no clioice but 

latisfaS/y /^ndZ/i of ?;eace 

and order in that part of the 'owe abandoned all claim to 


country, belying official claims ^ 
to the contrary less than two 
iveeks ago. . , r j 

In mourning their death, ana 
condemning those who perpc'^ 
trated the doMardly attack, let 
us, from this day, make a firm 
resolve that the heart of our na- 
'tional policy shall he to remove 
the conditions that lead men to 
extremes such as we have just 
witnessed, and let the lawful 
arm of the government go af- 
ter the attackers, whoever they 
may be, and bring them to ins- 
tice. 


con- } 


.sideration. 





, The gi’eatest tragedy of all is ^ 
S the plight of those thousands of i 
‘ l>eople caught in the middle, too ! 
frightened to defy the Huks, too 
bewildered to trust their govern- 
' too involved in the misdeeds 

of the Huk lenders to escape 
suspicion and punishment at the 
hands of government forces wlio 
now have no choice but to try 
their best to destroy the roots of 
a great evil In the land. 




The homage paid by a stricken nation 
, is ample testimony to a people’s love for 
- a^ great' soul, for .that people’s understand- ' 
^ ing of !,.all that that soul has meant to them 
—to the poor' and lowly among them. 

The name of Quezon resounds in his- 
■ tory. The -clangor of trumpets and the 
thunder of drums is only an echo of the 
g'pnd diapason that was the life of Ma- 
nuel Quezon,) who led a nation to liberty. 
That was .for the people and the world, to 
hjonqr. • ' y - 

V ) As dde'p .and as sonant are the muted 
' y-fet etrbng - tones that touch the heart — 
tiie hearts, Of the httle people who cannot 
feel as far— yet who feel far bey^ond the 
'■ pomp aia.d circumstance of -statesmanship. 

; These tones were of the pattern of the life 
of Aurora J^'agon de Quezon. They too 
were for the world, and for the people. 

< The bri^e, .insensate murder that broke 
those tones brought to her a martyrdom 
that will forever enshrine her memory in 
the hearts of the people whose love she 
gained. 

, In this time of mourning, of horror, the 
Filipino people may well rise above sor- 
row in the thought of this addition to their 
heritage — the Quezon name. 





STOP THOSE AMBUSCADES 

THE record shows that there have been 
■ seven ambuscades during the month in 
Nueva Ecjja alone. That’s too many acts of 
lawlessness within such a short span of time. 
Ihe last of these occurred only nine’ hours 
after the trag*ic killmgr of Mrs. Aurora A 
Quezon and eleven others while on their wav 
to Baler, Quezon. 

Two ambuscades a weelc should provide 
sufficient waming- to those in authority to 
take greater security measures in order to 
protect innocent lives. Too many^have al- 
ready been lost. It should be apparent from 
these frequent depredations that there is 
no sense in allowing ourselves to be lulled 
into a false sense of security. 

There must be constant vigilance on the 
part of those in whose hands depends pub- 
lic security. Nothing should be taken for 
We cannot regard the frequent, 
f scattered, attacks as mere symptoms. 

1 he more realistic attitude would be to con- 




theni part of a pattern, an organized 
‘ which constitutes a grave menace to 

i '4. 1 1^ _ 



\ y, . ^ 4! — I ”'vrv . ^ menace to 

‘ ‘ The ambush which took 

^ Nueva Ecija several hours after the 


' dastardly attack that cost the life of Mrs. 
; Quezon could easily be a diversionaiy tac- 
to draw away law enforcement agents 
scene of the murder of the Que- 

zons. 

; Until such time as the country is rid of 
u®® elements, security measures 
should be' taken to give the public max- 
imum assurance of safety in their peaceful 
endeavors to help make a go of this repub- 
lic. 

It should help a great deal to prevent am- 
buscades and highway robberies and kill- 
ings if mobile patrols are put to work in 
known dangerous sections of highways. 
During dangerous hours, busses and other 
vehicles could be stopped at checkpoints and 
convoyed by well-armed patrols. This should 
assure a reasonable amount of safety and 
should help facilitate the task of bringing 
to justice those responsible for an attack 
when and if it is perpetrated.

Dejad Al Gobierno .. 

En la histeria wxdional, causada por la fatal enibosca- 
dtt contra nuestra Uorada Dona Aurora de Quezon y su co- 
^itiva, los primei'os en apresurarse a “pescaid’ han sido los 
que mas parte tuvieron por common o por omiskm en la 
Creadon del estado de cosas que produjo la tragedia; y los 
primeros en exigir responsabilidades, son los que, si no con- 
iribuyeron directamente a crear la dtyaeion desesperada, 
ftieron corespoTisables del incremento, que ha tenido el 
deterioro de la paz y el orden en Filipinas. 

Fatalmente, tristemente se ha cumplido lo que desde 
hace tres ahos “Voz de Manila" ha venido pronosticando, 
jen el sentido de que “habria necesidad de que la sangre su- 
hiera a la cumbi'e, al olimpo," para que politicos, asociaciones 
cvdcas, periodicos e institvdones se dieran cuenta del dolor 
que tantos huerfanos de honrados' soldados, abnegados vo- 
luntarios, victimas propiciatorias entre hacendados y pro- 
Jetarios, venian sufriendo por la sedicion, por la tolerancia 
“^democratica" de elementos socidles perdidos en divagacio- 
nes ideologicas, de acrobatas de la demagogia promotora de 
la lucha de closes, de politicos interventores en toda accion 
polidaca no solo para parar el golpe de la fusticia, sino para 
qmtar de sms puestos a oficiales celosos de su deber, que 
propugnaban la prevcdenda del respeto a la ley, de gobei'- 
nantes acomodaticios a todos los vaivenes producidos por el 
Wjertinaje de la prensa en manos de nobles corazones im- 
pulsivos, pero de bisoha experiencia de la vida que viven de 
cara a los atrevidos progresos en renovar ideas y procedi- 
mientos, pero de espcddas a las irrefutables, inescapables 
lecdones de la historia de veinte siglos desde que Cristo 
cdyrio los brazos en la cruz pidiendo "amaros los unos a los 
otros", y mas miles de ahos desde la tragedia de Cain y 
Abel. 

La primera etapa del cumplimiento de nuestro pronos- 
Uco fue cuando la tragedia del Jvoz Bautista, que provoco 
la primera proscripcion de los sediciosos; ya no se trataba 
simplemente de soldados de la nacion, con ser los soldados 
lo mas heroico y abnegado que tiene el pueblo, sino que la 
bla criminal hatha subido al estrado judicial. El gobierno, 
secundado por el publico poseido de las primeros emociones 
histericas ante und realidad que aterraba ya, comenzo su 
labor de represion sistematica. 

La politicd, la comodidad acobo por abdndonar el em- 
peno policiaco, y como no caian mas que soldados, gentes 
senciUas, unos cuantos representantes menores de la auto- 
ridad; por eso no se volvieron a tener en cuenta la esenda 
del crimen de sedicion y la presencia de la perversidad. 

Vino la accion sincronizada de los representantes de la 
sedicion en los periodicos, en los circulos politicos, en el go- 
bierno mismo, y a pesar del charco de sangre que separaba 
del resto de la sociedad a los sediciosos, se penso en dar 
nuevas oportunidades a los enemigos publicos, se- die por 
consejo y consentimiento de todos la amnistia . . . 

Hubo ridiculo para el gobierno, burla sangrante contra 
las honrados ihtenciones presidendales, procaz contumacia 
de la sedicion, y volvimos a oir del sacrificio de los soldados, 
voluntaries, pobres masas campesinas entregadas a und vida. 
nomada... mientras los grandes pensadores empotrados 
en la prensa, en los selectos grupos dvicos, en los escahos 


legislativos, seguian intercediendo directa e indirectamente 
por la sedicion, con un pretexto m otro, con una razon m 
otra. 

Pero la ola crirriinal de la sedicion sintio en el oceano 
inmenso del comunismo internadonal un empuje arrollador. 
y la ola, dejando en la resaca las piltrafas de soldados, vo- 
luntaries, victimas y verdugos de menor categoria, se agito 
mas soberbia, subio al mismo santicario nacional de los afec- 
tos populates, arrastro tambien a la madre de su pueblo y 
a distinguidos seres de nuestra comunidad. 

Y ahi hemos llegado, segun' el pronostico que jamas hu- 
bicra querido “Voz de Manila" hacer en tres ahos de constan- 
te Uamada de atencion al gobierno y al pueblo, para que se 
tomara en honrada seriedad el avance del mal. 

Ahcyra que se ha llegado a parte de lo pretendido por 
^ mal imperante, (parte porque no dismulan torvamente su 
sed de mas sangre “escogida"), ahora resurge la propaganda 
de concejedes, legisladores, periodistas, caudiUos sociales en 
favor de la sedicion con EL PRETEXTO DE ATACAR EL 
MAL EN SU ORIGEN, en la necesidad de reforma social, 
empujando al pueblo a olvidar el pisoteo a la ley, a olvidar 
el crimen contra tbdo derecho natural, para recordar la re- 
forma social, para decir que no es soiamente con tiros, sino | 
con buena voluntad, con ilustracion, con medidas sabias de ' 
gobierno como se puede terminar con la aisis. 

INSEN8ATOS. No les impoHa el hecho de que esta- 
mos en plena guerra, declarada, proclamada, jurada de la 
sedicion contra el gobierno, contra el Estado. Es que espe- 
ran esos “angelitos modernos del pensamiento y de la accion 
democratica," que los criminales lleguen al terror general 
en todas las poblaciones donde van penetrando, y como en 
los tiempos de la barbarie. vayan las gentes abriendo su 
, corazon y sus entrahas al reformador Munfante a sangre 
y fuego? Es que tanta gente honrada e inofensiva quiere 
que, si por acaso muera dambien en el reinado del tenor, 
haya quien anuncie en los periodicos que ‘‘era contribuyente 
a la causa do los huhs^’, cornio oh BLASFEMIA, se difo de la 
Santa Doha Aurora en el sentido de quo era de las que mas 
sostenian el movimiento. . . y eso lo publicaron los que die- 
ron a la estampa la ultima carta de Taruc? 

Que el recuerdo de Boabdil, al Uorar sobre Granada per- 
dida, no se repita en nuostro gobierno y en nuestros ciuda- 
danos de alguna influencia social y oficial, pues si no vence- 
mos cotno hombres el empuje de la sedicion, muy pronto 
tendremos que Uorar su triunfo, con lagrimas do mujer. 

Por eso insistimos: estamos en plena guerra, y en la 
guerra no se permiten titubeos do hermafroditas, caricias al 
enemigo ni estorbo al militar. Dfjad a la Cruz Roja que 
vaya con temuras, a los capellanes con la conmiseracion, a 
los nihos con el panico del temor. Al Gobierno y al brazo 
armado de la nacion dejad que limpien el campo, y una vez 
limpio este levanten sus tiencRis de campaha de altruismo los 
reformadores civicos, los honrados videntes de la justicia 
social. Entonces, no antes, no vaya un tiro a secar la mano 
del que da pan, no vaya una ametraUadora a perforar el co- 
razon quo da amor, no vaya la granada de mano a levantar 
la tapa do los sesos a la cabeza, que busca para los des- 
graciados sediciosos la realizacion de un ideal. Entonces y 
no antes. Y ahora dejad tranquUo dl gobierno en accion, 
ahora mientras todavia hay Uempo, no despuea cuando ven - ' 
ga la desesperacion total. ■ 1

DONA AURORA 

Unanime es la indignacion como profundo y ge- 
neral el dclor que ha pvoducido el asesinato de la que 
por muchos titulos era el simbolo reconocido de la mujer , 
filipina de nuestros tiempos que, a las virtudes carac- 
teristicas de Maria Clara, sup6 juutar las cualidades 
civicas y el progreso intelectual de hogano. 

No haj^ vticablos bastantes para expresar cunapli- 
damente esos sentimientos de pena y condenacion que 
embargan el corazon de la nacidn filipina, y el de cuan- 
tos aman el bien y admiran la' virtud. Dona Aurora era 
amada y respetada quiza no tanto por la altisima posi- 
cion social que dignisimamente ocupo, cuanto por la 
caridad que constantemente ardia en su corazon y que 
sabia manifestarse de mil diyersos modos. Su excelsa 
personalidad era una alborada continua de buenas ' 
obras, de virtudes cristianas y civicas cuyos rayos 
iluminaban todos los confines sociales, lo mismo las 
suntuosas moradas de los ilustrados y pudientes que 
los humildes hogares de los desheredados de la fortuna. 
y el saber. Por esto, con su muerte han caido las som-

SLAYING OF MRS. QUEZON 
SHOCKS NATION 


AND DAUGHTER 



MKS. AURORA A. QL’I.ZOX 




]P A few days after President Elpidio 
Quirino had rounded out his one year 
of administration which he commemo- 
rated with a rousing fire-side chat enu- 
rrferating his accomplishments including 
the establishment of peace and order, 
afternoon newspaper readers and radio 
listeners were stunned with a special 
news flash;. Philippine National Red 
Cross Chairman Aurora Aragon Quezon, 
Baby Quezon and members of their 
party were slain or seriously wounded 
by armed attackers in Nueva Ecija. 
In a matter of hours the whole country 
learned the shocking details of the story. 
Besides Mrs. Quezon, Baby and Mayor 
Pcnciano Bernardo of Quezon City, 
nine others had died on the spot or soon 
after the ambush. 

According to integrated reports the 
Quezon motorcade travelling in eleven 
cais, station wagons and jeeps with a 
light Constabulary escort was just en- 
teiing Quezon province on its way to 
. Baler to unveil the historical marker 
. on Manuel Quezon’s birthplace when 
^ It was suddenly fired upon by a strong 
force of bandits and/or ^ukbalahapsl 
- Ex-Chief ,of Staff of the Philippine 
j Army Major General Jalandoni who 
■ was with Mrs. Quezon in a leading 
) car was the only person to crawl out 
I alive after a concentrated macliinegun 
: fire from the outlaws. Displaying an 
amazing complacency reflecting the op- 
timism of the administration the escort 
failed to put up any defense, much less 
provide the military intelligence work 
that could have averted the ambush. On 
this point many observers unanimously 
agreed. There was complete agreement 
too in the people's opinions regarding 
the national loss: the Philippines’ great- 
est humanitarian and first lady and her 
daughter Baby, a young socialite social 
worker — both of w hom did much to 
keep the people from forgetting the 
Quezonian service-to-country tradition.

So Tbis is Peace lot Order 



H ardly two weeks after President Quirino an- 
nounced that peace and order had b^en restor- 
ed — an “achievement” of his administration, Mrs. 
Aurora Aragon de Quezon, her daughter, her son-in- 
law and nine others were massacred in the most 
shocking tragedy the Philippines has experienced. 
The ambuscade, all the more barbarous because of 
the dignity and innocence of its victims, was never- 
-!-theless only one of a series of recent daring, succes- 
sive and similar raid by Huk bands on civilian trave- 
lers. It is only too evident, and increasingly so, that 
there is no peace and certainly no order. 

Editorial writers, national leaders, governmerit of- 
ficials and even the little man on the street have laid 
; the blame squarely at the door of the administration. 
■ And in the very last analysis one can reach under the 
circumstances, after all the emoting, the reproaches 
and regrets, the if-only’s and the what-might-have- 
been’s— after all that, jt remains that the govern- 
ment has failed, and with what revolting consequen- 


* ces, in giving the Filipino citizens what their con- 
stitution guarantees: protection to life and property. 

It took the death of the Quezons and their com- 
panions in death to jolt the government, and the na- 
tion with it, out of its egotistic politicking, out of 
its sdiug and blind complacency, out of its hay-mak- 
ing escapism, out of its cowardly refusal to recognize . 
that the Huks are still here, stronger if anything. In 
spite of amnesty, all-out campaign, firm assurance 
from general and department secretary and pres- 
ident, it has become painfully apparent everything is 
not all right, that the demon of Huklandia will not 
he exorcised by the incantation that “all is quiet.” 
nor appeased by ineffectual government crop loans, 
seedlings and irrigation systems nor annihiljited bv 
PC and AFP bombardments. 

Neither is it enough for the administration to 
claim now shamefacedly, in the face of such terrible 
proof of failure, that it has done its best. But has it? 
Or if it has, isn’t it undeniable that its best is far 
from being good enough? *

WHY? 

Even now the question is still being asked: Why was Mrs. 

Quezon killed? Nothing the Huks had done aroused so much anger 
all over the Philippines as the murder of Mrs. Quezon, her daughter 
and son-in-law, and nine others. The attack was sudden and trea- 
cherous. Dehberation was evident in the gun emplacements that 
had been prepared days in advance at the point of the ambuscade. 
Men were held captive, to make more deadly certain the success of 
the well-laid plan. For weeks in advance, it was generally known 
in the surrounding area that on that day Mrs. Quezon and P^^ty 
would pass along that road to Baler to honor the memory of her 
husband. The Huks boast of possessing a first-class inteUigence ser- 
vice, better, it is even said, than the Constabulary’s. The Huks knew 
that’ Mrs. Quezon was in tlie party when they opened fire on it. 
One of the killers said as Mrs. Quezon’s body lay dead, plundered 
of valuables by the forces, as the Communists like to term them, of 
national liberation: “Your Mrs. Quezon with the wliite hair is dead. 

But why was Mrs. Quezon killed? What possible benefit did 
the Huks expect from the murder? Tame has come out with a state- 
ment deploring the death of Mrs. Quezon. In his own way, he tried 
to praise the dead by claiming that she had contributed money to 
the movement of which he is the head. He places blame on the 
government and the Americans, pointing to the arrival of former U.S. 
Ambassador Paul V. McNutt as an ominous sim, but surely even 
Tame does not believe that the government and the Americans de- 
sired and plotted Mrs. Quezon’s death. „ 

Ta.ruc admits the possibility of a breach of the Iron Disciphne 
of the Huks and, if there is such a breach, promises punishment to 
the limits of severity” for the guilty. Is Tame then, no longer in 
full control of his men? Has he sowed the wind and now reaps the 
whirlwind? That the Huks murdered Mrs. Quezon and her party 
is beyond doubt. If Tame is in control of his men, if the Iron Disci- 
pline^’ he boasts of has not been breached, then one can only conclude 
that Luis Tame coldly ordered the massacre, that the slaughter of 

the innocents was his wiU. .o rpi, ^ 

But why? Was it, perhaps, to discredit the government? There 
may lie the answer. President Quirino has said more than once 
with complacency, and mihtary authorities have echoed him, that 
peace has been restored. The ambuscade - was it not Tames de- 
fiant answer to that claim?

?r;iir™ ■" • 

reoorf'^f'!i,°^ Manila and nearby provinces were shocked. by the 
New * f f members of her family. 

leve It at first, but passion and sorrow ran high when the citv 
newsnapers and radio stations confirmed the story. 

The follownie day the news of the undeserved killing of the 
beloved widoj of the “emblem of the greatness” of our departed 

cornL^^f J ?T’ ^ Quezon, reached all 

^o^ners of the Jslands. 

fu JrM? ’■’' ®®”''o Salubusob on a bend of 

the Villa Aurora-Zigzag Bongabon. It was near the approaches 
to Baler and wthin Nueva Ecija. 

The Quezon party was a motorcade of several cars including 
ippDs aiin.cT constabulary men who served as escort. 

The group was bound for Baler to attend ceremonies for the 
unveiling of a marker of the birthplace of the late President Que- 
7.on. 

Included among the known killed were: ‘Col. Primitivo San 
Agustin and Lt. Col. Antonio San Agustin; two lieutenants, and 
Tour other persons. 

Wonnd.“d were Maj. Gen. Rafael Jalandoni, ex-Chief of Staff 
of the Philippine Army, Cant. O. Manalang and a corporal. 

After the massacre, the killers robbed their victims of their cash 
and other valuables. 

The mortal remains of the Quezon family were brou£:ht to the 
UST chapel where milling crowds of admirers and sympathizers, 
from the humblest to the hiirhest, eagerly souerht entrance. 

The deceased were survived by Nini and Nonong Qu-°zon, who 
wm‘e heard to have collansed when told of what had happened. 
Nini is the wife of Philip, by whom they have a child. 

The following day, the nation mourned as the remains of the 
Quezons were laid to rest at the^ Cementerio del Norte,, beside the 
tomb of the ‘"grand old man.” - ’ 

The funeii'al was attended by a* crowd estimated from 200,000 
upwards, which lined the streets from the UST chapel to the ce- 
metery. 

Everyone was bowed in grief. In the same breath, each felt 
unbounded anger at the heartless, savage murderers. 

To avenge the death of the nation's beloved family, -a joint 
aimy-PC force of 2,000 armed men at once went on a punitive drive 
against Hubs and bandits around the area where Mrs. Quezaji and 
paity were ambushed.

Editorial Digest 


In unison, the Manila papers cry out for swift 
justice against the perpetrators of *the murder of 
Mrs. Aurora Aragon Quezon and 11 members of 
her party. It’s the last straw, they all say in effect, 
in words as follows: 

The Manila Times: “A people cowers in sor- 

row today. The most revered woman in the land, 
her daughter, ten others were massacred, while 
traveling on a public road... this fact cannot be 
explained, cannot be excused, cannot be rational- 
ized. . . Doha Aurora, the widow of Manuel L. Que- 
zon, the quiet shining lamp th,at held before the 
people the memory of that flaming light of free- 
dom that was Quezon, was murdered. And the 
people cowers in sorrow — and waits — for more 
murders? 

The Manila Chronicle: “The question is WHY. 
Why a movement whose leaders claim to be ins- 
pired by a passion to improve life must needs des- 
. troy innocent life to attain its ends. Why the tra- 
gic hand of chance must fall on a woman, beloved 
of her people: on a woman whose heart went even 
for those who snuffed out her life. No crime could 
be more heinous. The circumstances which 
brought to fruition the tragedy of ye.sterday must 
be rooted out once and for all or Mrs. Quezon shall 
have died in vain.”-* 

>« >€ >« 

The Manila Daily Bulletin* ‘‘There seems no al- 
ternative now to a determined pursuit and liquida- 
tion of the dissidents of Central Luzon. They have 
: finally committed the unpardonable sin. There 
may have been a residual sympathy for the Huks 
; because of their economic underprivilege, but when 
they seek to call national attention to their plight 
by "deliberately destroying a nationally-loved sym- 
bol of decency, of good deeds, of long-loved tradi- 
tion and of the highest feminine virtue, then the 
law-abiding people of the land have no choice but 
to tum» against them.” 


A people cowers in sorrow today* 

Never before In remembered histoi^ has this people sqf- 
iered such a blow. 

The most revered woman in the land, her daughter, ten 
others, were massacred, while traveling on a public road. 

These are the facts. 

They cannot be explained, they cannot be excusedy they 
cannot be rationalized. 

The killers knew whom they were killing. All the evi- 
dence points that way. They were told. Yet they killed. 

It is fatuous to make distinctions. It is fatuous to say 
that the killers were this and that, and not that and this. 

The simple fact stares out, that this was premeditated 
attack, carefully arranged t6 bring the maximum of attacking 
force on the prey which the attackers knew was going to be 
at a certain place at a certain time. 

Dna. Aurora Aragon de Quezon, the widow of Manuel 
L. Quezon, was murdered. The quiet, shining lamp that held 
before the people the memory of that flaming light of free- 
dom that was Quezon, was murdered. 

Aurora Quezon, that bright, sparkling flash that was 
such a vivid reflection of a world-great father, was murdered. 

Ten other innocent people werer murdered. 

And a people cowers in sorrow — and waits — for 
more murders? 


I d i t o r i a I — 


No Greater Crime 

The que3?:Ron is WHY. 

Why a movemefiit whose leaders claim to be ins- 
pired by a passion to improve life must needs de- 
stroy innocent life to attain its ends. Why the tra- 
gic hand of chance must fall on a womauj, beloved of 
her people; on a woman whose heart went even for 
those v/ho snuffed out her life. No crime could be 
more heinous. 

Let us remember. 

Mrs. Aurora Quezon was on her way to honor 
the memory of her husband, a man whose career 
was founded on an abiding love for the common 
man. She had made that love the mamspring of 
her life. And so the ironic overtones of her death 
cannot be lost even to those who killed her. 

And Mrs. Quezon was not alone. There were 
others with her in her fatal trip and all of them 
must now be chatked up as victims of the relentless 
pursuit of ends through violent means. 

But there is no time for recrimination, only for 
justice. 

The crime speaks out loudly and eloquently for 
the government to act swiftly — and wisely, to 
bring its implacable force on the authors of the deed. 

^ No compromise is possible any longer. 

Those in authority cannot hide the situation from 
the rest of the people any more. The truth must 
be out — the sad, bitter truth that the Huks are still 
' ' « problem, shocking us by the impact of their excess- 

es. Gratuitous statements from government officials 
shifting the deed of Mrs. Quezon’s death to other 
than the most possible perpetrators thereof must be 
dssrnissed as an attempt to hide a terrible failure. 

The niurder of Mirs. Quezon and her daughter 
.. and her friends is not an isolated case in the violent 
career of the Huks. The question is why they must 
resort to naked lawlessness, why they must use ter- 
ror to remold the world nearer to their hearts’ de- 
sire. 

But there must be no more violence, no more 
killings. The Huks have committed no greater out- 
rage. The problem they pose must be solved.. This 
should be our goal and the circumstances which 
brought to fruition the tragedy of yesterday must 
be rooted out once and for all or Mrs. Aurora Que- 
a woman beloved of all, shall have died in vain

los complices del crimen con su obra quintocolumnista, su 
obra de espionaje y de ayuda econdmica y tdctica a los se- 
diciosos. Guerra'dn cuartel, pero guarra de verdad, con to- 
dos los recursos de' nuestras organizadones armadas, pues . 
si eso no se hace, esta RepPblica se verd envuelta en tiempo 
prdximo en la mas horrenda guerra dvU. El gobemante 
que no ordene esto, el dudadano que no acepte esto, el ser- \ 
vidor publico refractario o negligente sobre esto, redlnrdn 
la maldidon de la historia. < 

Adoptemos esta resoludon, recordando al Presidents 
Quezon, padre de nuestro pueblo, cuyos pedazos del alma la 
sedidon asesina ha descuartizado con horrenda crimen, ha- 
dendo de su sdnta esposa y de sus hijos juntamente con un 
grupo de amigos y leales, las vtctimas propiciatorias para 
el restabledmiento total, literal, sin dibujos retdricos, de Ic 
paz y el orden en FUipinas, que por reinar aparentemente en 
dudades y pueblos fueron proclamados existentes, mientras 
la tecnica represiva se contento con ahuyentar y arrinconar 
a la fiera, sin poner fin a ella. Adoptemos esta resoludon con 
toda la honradez dudadana, olviddndose el legislador de los 
cortes de presupuesto para la defensa armada de nuestra 
tranquilidad social. 

La tragedia que ahora nos tiene en duelo nadonal, es 
cribe ominosa la condenacion de los que de un modo u otrc 
han hecho rektjarse la disciplina sodal, el respeto a la ley % 
a la autoridad, de los que con teorias novedosas sobre avancc 
democrdtico han olvidado la prdctica antigua de la perver- 
sidad criminal del libertinaje en la democracia. Y esta tra- 
gedia, esta catdstrofe que siembra dolor y tristeza en laf 
conciencias honradas, manda que may oria y minoria, go- 
bemantes y oposidonistas, se unan para el exterminio de l( 
sedicidn. 

Por los manes de la patria, por los caudillos que en vide 
velaron por la felicidad de la nacion, no olvidemos LA TRA- 
GEDIA QUE ESCRIBE Y MANDA. 


. A People In Sorrow 

A people cowers in sorrow today. 

before !n remembered histoi^ hos this people suf- 
fered such a blow. 

Th® rnost revered woman in the land, her daughter, ten 
ners, were massacred, while traveling on a public road. 

These are the facts. 

They cannot be explained, they cannot be excused, they 
ccnnot be rationalized. 

The killers knew whom they were killing. All the evl- 
qence points that way. They were told. Yet they killed. 

. " fatuous to make distinctions. It is fatuous to say 

TU *^1*’®**^ fhafr anc* not that and this. 

The simple fact stares out, that this was premeditated 
attack, carefully arranged t6 bring the maximum of attacking 
orce on the prey which the ottackers knew was going to, be 
of a certain place at a certain time. 

. Aurora Aragon de Quezon, the widow of Manuel 

©uezon, was murdered. The quiet, shining lamp that held 
before the people the memory of that flaming light of free- 
that was Quezon, was murdered. 

Aurora Quezon, that bright, sparkling flash that was 
such Q vivid reflection of a world-great father, was murdered. 

Ten other innocent people were' murdered. 

And a people cowers In sorrow — and waits — for . 
fnore murders? 


1 d i t o r i a i — 


No Greater Crime 

The question i» WHY. 

Why a movement whose leaders claim to be ins- 
pired by a pasftion to improve life must needs de- 
stroy innocent life to attain its ends. Why the tra- 
gic hand of chance must fall on a womamij, beloved of 
her people; on a woman whose heart went even for 
those who snrj*ffed out her life. No crime could be 
more heinous. v 

Let us remember. 

Mrs. Aurora Quezon 'wes on her way to honor 
the memory of her husband, a man whose career 
was founded on an abiding love for the common 
man. She had made that love the mainspring of 
her life. And so the ironic overtones of her death 
cannot be lost ex^en to those who killed her. 

And Mrs. Quezon was not alone. There were 
others with her in^ her fatal trip and alii of them 
must now be chalked up as victims of the relentless 
j5ursuit of ends through violent means. ^ 

But there is no time for recrimination, only for 
justice. 

The criiffijie speaks out loudly and eloquently for 
the government to act swiftly — and v/isely, to 
. bring its implacable force on the authors of the deed. 
No compromise is possible any longer- 

Those in authority cannot hide the situation from 
the rest of the people any more. The truth must 
be out — the sad, bitter truth that the Huks arc atill 
^ ' « problem, shocking us by the impact of their excess- 

es. Gratuitous statements from government officials 
shifting the deed of Mrs. Quezon’s death to other 
than the most possible perpetrators thereof must be 
^ dismissed as an attempt to bide a terrible failure. 

The murder of Mrs. Quezon and her daughter 
vBnd her friends is not an isolated case in the violent 
career of the Huks. The question is why they must 
resort to naked lawlessness, why they must use ter- 
ror to remold the world nearer to their hearts’ de- 
sire. 

But there must be no more violence, no more - 
kflltiings. The Huks have committed no greater out- 
rage. The problem they pose must be solved.- This 
should be our goal and the circumstances which 
brought to fruition the tragedy of yesterday must 
be rooted out once and for all or Mrs. Aurora Que- 
zon, a woman beloved of all, shall have died in vain.

Quirino Mourns 
At Quezon Bier 


President Rushes 
Down From Baguio 


Sadness was written, all-over 
[President Quirino’s face as "he 
prayed for the Quezon family at 
the UST chapel this morning. 

I 

The President, in a white linen 
I suit, with a black tie and a black 
band around his left arm, entered 
the chapel about 9:26 a.m. to- 
day with his daughter Vicky. A 
hush fell on the chapel as he 
cttme escorted by aides. He had 
just arrived by plane from Ba- 
guio a few minutes before. 

The milling hundreds in the 
chapel willingly gave him room as 
he went directly near the altar 
at which the caskets lay. He 
moved as if to approach Mrs. Que- 
zon's casket, but instead knelt 
down to pray. 

Almost at the same time, NinI 
and Nonong Quezon appeared at 
the altar, to which they had quiet- 
ly slipped by a backdoor. No- 
nong, his eyes red, immediately 
proceeded to pray. Nini looked at 
the caskets for a while, then told 
a friend, ‘T want to know where 
they are,” meaning she wished to 
find out which body was in what 
coffin. She refused to have the 
caskets opened. 


The cask^^ts of Mw Quezon and . 
Mayor Ponciano Bernardo were 
draped with Red Cross flags. 
Quezon City policemen stood vigil 
over Bernardo’s casket, Red Cross 
personnel over Mrs. Quezon’s, . and ' 
Girl Scouts over Baby’s and Philip 
^ Buencamino’s. 

j Gen. Rafael Jalandoni, former 
' APP chief of staff, was. the cen- 
ter of attention at the XJST cha- • 
pel this morning. He had a small 
scratch on his right cheek. 

An atmosphere of quiet trag- 
edy hang over the chapel as peo- 
ple came and went. 

Mrs. Bernardo and the mother 
of the late mayor declined to go 
near the altar and view the re- 
mains. On Mrs. Bernardo’s face 
; was a look of unbelief. 

High officialdom had been rub- 
bing elbows with common citizens 
at the chapel since early this 
morning. Among the first to pay 
their final respects wefe Senate 
President Mariano J. Cuencor 
Speaker Eugenio Perez, Senate 
President Protempore Melecio Ar- 
- ranz, Auditor General Manuel 
Agregado, Secretary Primitive Lo- 
vina, Senators Carlos P. Garcia 
and Fernando Lopez, Manager 
Sergio Bayan, Undersecretary Re-

Lockett, Generals Jonathan Ander- 
son, CalLxto Duque and Alberto 
Ramos, RPC Governor Delfin 
Buencamino, Secretai*y Teodoro 
Evangelista, and Governor Grego- 
rio Santayana. Mesdames Trini- 
,dad Roxas, Consuelo Salazar Pe- 
rez and Col. Andres Soriano also 
went to the chapel early. 

Many of those who went to the 
I chapel were disappomted at not 
; having been able to'^have a last 
look at Mrs. Quezon. They said 
their had no opportunity to see 
the late President’s widow in per- 
son in her lifetime.

The President will rush to Manila 
at 8 a.m. tomorrow to attend per- 
sonally to all the necessary arrange- 
ments for the last honors and in- 
ternment of the Quezon family. 

Cabinet meetings and other ap- 
pointments here for Fricray were 
summarilji cancelled as a result of 
the incident. 

The President expressed the bp- 
lief that the ambuscades was engin*. 
eered by pure bandits and discount- 
ed reports that the Huks had a. 
hand in it, adding that the Huks’ 
love the Quezon famity. • 

The President’s statement on the 
incident follows: 

“I received shocking news with 
the feeling that it was the news of 
the death of my own mother. I 
offered the use of my plane to Mrs. 
Quezon and party, which was going 
to attend the fiesta in Baler but 
she refused. I understand there, 
were eight cars in the party that 
left Manila. People evidently were 
informd ahead of time about Mrs. 
Quezon’s arrival. I am not sure 
this ambush was by Huks. If they 
knew before hand that it was Mrs. 
Quezon’s party, they wouTd not 
harm her because the Huks like 
Mrs. Quezon. To me it is pure' 
banditry and the whole country is 
enraged because of this incident. I 
have ordered the immediate con- 
centration of armed forces not only 
in Xueva Ecija but in the vicinity 
to clean up the whole region o"f 
bandits. I have asked Mr. Yulo to 
make preliminary arrangements as 
my personal representative for the 
disposition of the bodies of the dead 
as well as the care of the wound- 
ed before I go down to Manila early 
tomorrow. 

“I will attend personally in Ma- 
nila to all riecessarj’ arrangements 
and discuss more expeditious mea- 
sures to be adopted in connecUon 
with this most unfortunate incident 
tn a family very much loved by the 
entire Filipino people. I know the I 
whole country mourns Mrs. Qu^-| 
zon’s death. She was a real mother! 
to her people.” , ‘ ■

Quezon province. Mrs. Quezon’s part}^ were on the way- 
to the late President’s hometown to inaugurate a marker^ 
that the government, on orders of President Quirino, had

at the massacre. The incident appeared to have revised general 6pi^-|

SHOCKED NATION 
CLAMORS FOR DRIVE 
ON LAWLESSNESS 


Funeral Of Mrs. Quezon 
And Children This P.M.; 
Sorrow Felt Everywhere 

B?; ’VICENTE L. DEL FIERRO and LUIS M. DE LEON 

Of the Star Revorter Staff 

The stark tragedy that fell on the nation with the killing* in 
^Dush on the road to Baler, yesterday, of Mrs. Aurora Aragon dl. 
Quezon, her daugnter Baby Quezon, ner son-in-law r elipe ijuenca- 
mino III, Mayor Ponciano Bernardo of Quezon City, and eight others, 
has roused people in all sections of life in all parts of the country 
to demand for. a determined drive to root out lawlessness completely 
from the Republic. 

Messages poured in Malacahan and in newspaper offices, from 
all points of the compass this morning, mourning the death of the 
distinguished widow of the greatest Filipino of the 20th Century, and 
truly the most outstanding representative of Filipino motnerhood. 

. Surch^ged with grief, these messages are one in demanding that 
'President Quinno use the full might of the lawful arm of the gov- 
e rnment to go after the^ lawles^elements and bring them to justice, 

^I'while at the same time demanding 
an all-out offensive to bring light 
and hope to our bewildered mas- 
ses. 

The tragedy was big news 
around the world. President Tni- 
man was shocked by the report. 
Wherever the report of the trage- 
dy was flashed, within and out- 
side the Philippines, the feeling 
was one of revulsion and grief. 

Last night, endless thousands 
struggled to see the bodies of the 
I deceased at “the Funeraria Nacio- 
nal blocking traffic blocks away 
on either side of the parlor on 
Rizal Avenue. 

The burial, in obedience to the 
wishes of Nonong and Mrs. Nini 
Quezon Buencamino, surviving 
children of the former First Lady 
of the Land, will take place this 
afternoon, at four oVlock. 

Funeral arrangements were 
completed this morning in Mala- 
cahan under the personal charge 
of former Speaker Yulo, as perso- 
nal representative of President F’pidio Quirino. 

Top government officials, the nation’s top business and civic lead- 
ers and representatives of the common man whose welfare has been 
the life-long concern of the Quezon family will attend the funeral 
rites.

The ndws of the tragic incident 
i swept the country yesterday with 
; a biugeouing shock that people at 
, first would refuse to believe the 
: reports. 

The factory workers, the street 
cleaner, the lowly government em- 
ployee and the plain laborer whose 
lot have been ameliorated by the 
social justice program, inunci ated 
and carried out by the late Pre- 
sident Quezon, and the disaster 
victim whose spirit has been lift- 
ed by the mere mention of Doha 
i Aurora’s name, more than any one 
.else feel the tragic loss. 

1 Grief not less bitter than those , 
obsei*ved when the ^death of Pre-; 
.sident Quezon was announced 
swept the length and breadth of 
the land. 

The bodies of the Quezon fami- 
ly were transferred last night 
from the Funeraria Nacional to 
the UST chapel where people from 
all walks of life, in visible mourn- 
ing trek to view the remains of 
the beloved of the people. 

Masses for the deceased were 
said at the UST chapel from 6:00 
to 9:00 this morning. Bishop Ru- 
|fino Santos officiated at the 9:00 
a.m. mass. Mons. Santos will al- 
so perform the last blessing at 
the cemetery this afternoon. 

Only Nini Quezon Buencamino 
and her child, and Nonong Que- 
zon are the survivors of the il- 
lustrious family. 

First reports of the tragedy 
were received in the city when 
Governor Juan 0. Chioco wired 
I the department of the interior 
(about the ambuscade. 

I President Quirino directed the 
I Constabulary and the Army yes- 
terday to comb the areas around 
the ambush site, to locate the ban- 
dits or whoever perpetrated the 
^ dastardly deed. He also came 
down this morning for the fune- 
ral, and was present this morn- 
ing at the Sto. Tomas Universi- 
I ty chapel, where the bodies were 
removed and where requiem mas- 
ses W’ere held. A requiem mass 
was also said at the Gilmore Ave- 
nue home of the Quezons. 

General Rafael Jalandoni, for- 
mer AFP chief of staff, and once 
one of the protegees of the late 
First Lady, related dn Malacahan 
last night, still in his bloodstain- 
ed polo shirt, how the dastardly, 
crime was perpetrated even as he 
shouted out the name of Mrs. 
Quezon as leading the party. 

Dr. Eduardo Quisumbing, who ; 
was also unhurt contrary to first! 

! reports, was the cynosure of inte-l 
rest in Funeraria Nacional lasti 
night as he related his own ver-: 
.‘‘•'on of the tragedy. 

Mrs. Nini Quezon Buencamino 
was rendered prostrate by the ‘ 
triple tragedy and she lay weep- - 
ing all night, comforted by friends 
of the family. Nonong Quezon was 
also grief -stricken . the whole 
night long. 

Another person who miraculous- 
ly escaped unhurt was Hilarion Si- 
layan, PACSA executive officer 
Two blowouts in his ^ar, forcing 
him to cliange tires and be left 
behind, proved ])rovidential. 


SURVIVORS' 
ACCOUNT OF 
AMBUSCADE 


Members of the motorcade that 
accompanied Dha. Aurora Ara- 
e:on de Quezon' on a trip to Baler, 
Quezon, yesterday morning, who 
miraculously escaped alive from 
the fatal ambu'^cade which claim-, 
cd the lives of 12 victims g*ave 
the STAR RFPORTER a vivid 
account of their harrowing’ expe-^ 
rience. ! 


Mrs. Quezon's car, which led 
.the motorcade, was negotiating a' 
hilly bend when the first volley 
was fired by what was believed 
■to be a Huk band of no less than 
100 strong. According to General; 
Rafael Jalandoni, former PA 
chief of staff, the ambush was so 
swift that the PC escorts of the 
entourage had positively no op- 
nortunitv to jump in to the de- 
fense of 4Trs. Quezon. ' 

Genera^ Jalandoni said that ho 
and Mayor Ponciano Bernardo of 1 
Quezon City, who were then rid- ' 
ing with Mrs. Quezon, imme- 
diately jiimped out of the besieg- 
ed car with hands up in the air. 
Mayor Bernardo shouted to the ^ 
attackers that Mrs. Quezon was ! 
inside, probably in the belief that 
she would be spared by them. 

Before he could gather his ; 
wits, however,"^ Jalandoni stated ■ 
that he was rendered unconscious 
bv a gun butt blow on the right 
cheek. When he came to, after 
several minutes, Jalandoni found 
that all of his companions in the 
automobile were already dead, ex- , 
cept Philip Buencamino, III, 
vrhn was serioii^iv wounded. On 


closer scrutiny, the retired army; 

' boss further discovered that fhe: 

I attackerjs had .also relieved Mrs. 
Ou^zon and the other victims of, 
their jewelry and valuables. I 

Mrs. Amparo Aragon de An-; 
gara, sister to Mrs. Quezon, de-: 
c’avpd that she was riding in a 
c^ntiol^ v.^agon some four or five- 
cars behind tha^ of Mrs. Quezon.

O the people whose nation it was his destiny to 
X mould into a state, Manuel L. Quezon became a 
symbol of their aspirations whom they readily ac- 
^pted to be one who belongs to the ages. As though 
it were his creation, his country seemed to mirror all 
his qualities — his self-confidence, his quick temper, 
his stubbornness. He was a man whose name they 
had learned to swear by, whose shades they called up, 
whose standard they gauged his successors by. 

That is why . the happy faces pictured on this 
page — ^his wife’s and two daughters’ — kept filling wiUi 
pride whenever grouped around the living man 
(above) or, with Quezon already gone, when they 
posed beside a portrait or a bust of him. If his fa- 
ther had gone the hard way steering his country’s 
course, young Quezon {left) would be at it too, if in 
a negative manner. 

To the family he had left, Quezon had given 
prestige, dignity and, above all,, his own name. Be- 
cause they could not help reflecting his glory, wher- 
ever they went the Quezon family seemed to walk 
in the shadow of the great man, and his people res- 
pected and accorded them a recognition such as has 
never been, given any other family. People heeded 
the words of Doha Aurora and whether it was poli- 
tics or charity campaigns she was in, they responded 
to her call. Always hovering around her were poli- 
tical hopefuls, many of whom she had launched to a 
successful career. She had built the Philippine Na- 


bonal Red Cross into the biggest charity organization 
m the country. In public ceremonies, she cut an in- 
dispensable figure, and her mere presence endowed 
any event with dignity, decorum and honor. Every- 
where she was welcomed with the same warmth and 
spontaneity that she used to be greeted with when 
her husband was still alive. To occasions intended 
to perpetuate his memo^, like the one pictured at 
*^sht, she was certain to be invited, as though *it 
would lose all meaning if she was not around. 

To Baler three days ago, in the remote northern 
strip of the province renamed after her husband, Dona 
Aurora went on a trip, along with daughter Baby and 
a party of friends, to officiate in one such occasion. 
She would have given anything to be there — ^Baler 
was her own hometown, and for the first time in 
Baler, history, a marker would be unveiled on the 
very spot» where Quezon was born. 

She didn’t make it; three kilometers from. Baler, 
the motor party was ambushed over frenetic protests 
that Doha Aurora and Baby Quezon were in it. 
As the news reached them, a vague rumor at first, 
then an incredulous news story that required news- 
paper extras, a scandalized nation wondered what 
could be wrong — and how much farther it could be 
wrong — with a country in which two Quezons were 
murdered in cold blood. , Perhaps by force of habit, 
they again swore by Quezon’s name, called up his 
shades, gauged his successors by his standard. 





Huk, PC or 

Quezon he hod no name 


The men on this page were first in the heart of the gieat Queaon. They had no 
names; to him a tao was neither Huk, PC nor civilian— he was a fnend. He 
took Malacanan to that friend frequently. He stayed in a Palace, rode in a 
limousine or sailed in a yacht, but he lived with them. At least, that was how 
he impressed his people. In him and his wife, the tao had two fnends. When 
0uc2on died, there was left only one. But his widow turned out to be the equi- 
valent of two. Wherever she went— as a Red Cross manager, a church worker, 
a social representative, or merely a neighbor, she carried perpetually the me- 
mory of Quezon. 

It was the biggest tragedy for the Philippines that one such tao, or group 
of taos, misguided, misdirected and crazed, ambushed her party and killed her, 
her daughter, her son-in-law, and nine others, and incidentally also killed the 
respect of her people for these elements.

The two officials, who were * 
riding in separale cars, said 
they got lost on the way. They 
recalled that when they were 
about to arrive at the scene ot 
the shooting they met constabu- 
lary soldiers in a jeep who were 
on their way to get reinforce- 
ments from the Bongabon de- 
tachment. They said the soldiers ; 
told them to return. 

Marquez and Guevarra said the 
incident took place at a H'eache- 
rous terrain of Sierra Madie 
mountain near the boundary of 
Nueva Ecija and Quezon province. 

Marquez and Dr. Quisumbing 
said the party 

residence at about d :30 a. m.^es 
terday. There were about 3 (r pei- * 
sons in the group who were ac- 
commodated in 12 cars. 

According to Marquez, the main 
mission of Mrs. Quezon and party 
was to unveil 

Ar at the birthplace of hei hus- 
hlnd the late President Quezon, 
a^wel as to inaugurate the Baler 
memorial hospital and to attenu .

Alandy .said also that the . 
bers of the party with Mrs. Que- 
zon in Mayor Bernardo’s Biiick 
were shot in cold blood. Buenca- 
mino was fatally shot in. th^ left 
arm pit with a high calu -^nn. 

The weapon must have been 
pressed against his chest by his 
assailant because the flesh around 
the entry point of the bullet was 
burned, he added. 

Marquez said the personnel of 
the department of agriculture and 
public works joined Mrs. Quezon 
iin different missions. He said the 
public works officials were sche-, 
duled to inspect irrigation anef 
flood control, while the agricul- 
ture officials were on a seven-day 
inspection of a land for mecha- 
nized farming and general food 
production. ’ 

Another eyewitness who was in 
the thick of the ambush but who 
miraculously survived is Joaquin 
Villadelgado, chauffeur of Mrs. ; 
Quezon since 1946 . After the 
shooting, he drove the jeep he was 
driving to Cabanatuan and later 
from Cabanatuan to Manila alone. 

He arriv’ed at Malacafian short- 
ly before 8 p. m., his khaki shirt 
and pants splattered with blood 
stains. He said there were three 
others with him in the jeep, which 
was the fourth vehicle from Mrs, 
Quezon’s car. Two of his passen- 
gers were killed but one, whose 
name he did not know, survived 

The youthful, chauffeur said the 
convoy was going up a hill along a 
zig-zag road at kilometer 168 
when the ambuscade took place. _ 
Firing was from the elevated 
ridges on both sides of Ihe ^’oad, 
but the chauffeur said "bullets 
came from all directions. In the 
first volley he saw Col. San 
Agustin and his lone companion in ■ 
the jeep just ahead of his, killed . 

The chauffeur said that. 
he realized it was an ambush he 
jumped out of the car into a di ch 
on the side of the road. After the 
firing had died down, an armed 
man^came and stood right over 
him and poised his rifle to shoot. 

At that moment.

La Trag'edia Segun 
Relat^n Testigos 



. Una verdadera camiceria fue 
];la que hicieron los Huks en las 
personas, que iban en el coche 
•de Doha Aurora Aragon Vda. de 
Quezon durante la emboscada, 
que tuvo lugar ayer mahana en 
la carretera entre Baler y Bon- 
■ gabon, segun la descripcion de los 
supervivientes, que llegaron ano- 
che a Manila acompahando los 
siete cadaveres, que fueron lle- 
vados a la Funeraria Nacional a 
.eso de las 7:00 p.m. 

La Sra. De Sixto de la Costa, 
Amparo Aragon Vda. de Angaya, 
el Dr. Vicuna, la Sra de Ma- 
ximo Rodriguez, el Dr. Eduardo 
Quisumbing, (a quien se conto 
entre los muertos), la Srta. En- 
riqueta Amador, y otros llegaron 
anoche, 

El relate de los supeivivientes 
fue que la comitiva estaba com- 
puesta de 14 coches y ‘'Jeeps’* quo] 
partieron de Manila con rumbo 
a Baler. Cerca ya de la linea di- 
visoria de la provincia de Quezon, 
y estando aun en territorio de 
Nueva Ecija, los pasajeros de los 
coches oyeron la primera descar- 
ga. El coche de Doha Aurora fue 
el que recibio por delante los ba- 
lazos de las ametralladora de los 
disidentes. El chofer*fue mortal- 
mente herido y detuvo el coche. 
Doha Aurora se reclino a un lado 
con un balazo en la cabeza. Esta- 
ba muerta. El Alcalde Bernardo 
se asomo la vcntanilla para gri- 
tar a los atacantes que se acer- 
caban al coche, que Doha Aurora 
Vda. de Quezon estaba dentro del 
vehiculo. La lespuesta fue otra 
descarga de los que componian el 
grupo Huk. 

Mientras caian muerto el Al- 
calde Bernardo, Baby, y el cho- 
fer, fue cuando el General Rafael 
Jalandoni, que estaba dentro del 
vehiculo, cogio una ametrallado- 
dora de mano y trato de bajar del 
coche para hacer frente a los 
Huks, que rodeaban el vehiculo. 
Un culatazo en la cabeza le hizo 
caer sin sentido al general. 

Despues de nriatar a todos los 


que iban en el coche de Doha 
Aurora, los Huks despojaron a 
Doha Aurora y a Baby de las al- 
hajas que llevaban y a los hom- 
bres tambien. Solo el General 
Jalandoni quedo con vida por ha- 
bersele tornado por muerto. 

Los otros coches a las primeras 
descargas pudieron volver y re- 
troceder pues el camino iba zig- 
zagueado. La escolta de consta- 
bularies que iba en un “jeep’' ba- 
jo el Teniente Lasam hizo frente 
a la gruesa banda de Hulcs. El 
Teniente Lasam y tres. de sus sol- 
dados cayeron muertos al primer 
encuentro. Los otros soldados 
continuaron atrincherados resis- 
tiendo el fuego de los Huks hasta 
que llegaron refuerzos. 

En el relate de los supervivien- 
tes anoche se echaba de ver que 
los Huks sabian quienes eran los 
que iban en el coche de Doha A‘u- 
rora, cuando asesinaron a los que 
sobre vivieron a la primera des- 
carga de la emboscada. 

Los cadaveres que llegai'on 
anoche, fueron los de Dha. Auro- 
ra, Baby, Alcalde Bernardo, Pri- 
mitivo Agustin, Antonio San 
Agustin, el de Felipe Buencamino 
III y el chofer. 

Felipe Buencamino murio ayer 
tarde en el hospital provincial 
de Cabanatuan, debido a las heri- 
das sufridas. Antes de expirar 
llamo a la Srta. Amador y le dijo 
en ingles: “Take care of my darl- 
ing! (Cuida de mi amada), refi- 
riendose a su esposa Nini Que- 
zon. Esta quedo postrada ayer 
mahana al ser informada de la 
muerte de su madre, pero hasta 
anoche no so le habia infonnado 
del tristc final de su esposo. 


Miles de curiosos y simpatiza-V

de llegar los cadaveres.

MANILA, April 29 — (Friday) 
— (INS) — A major military 
campaign was launched today 
against Central Luzon rebels 
who killed Mrs. Aurora Quezon, 
widow of the Philippines* first 
president, and eleven f.thers 
when they were ambushed a 
motorcade yesterday. 

Ten Ollier nersou-s were woun- 
dd as the bandits ra ;ed the cars 
with machine gnu fire. 

President Elpidio Quirino 
immediately ordered mobiliza- 
tion of all available troops for 
an all-out 'offensive against the 
brigands, and several thousand 
constabulary troops were hurl- 
ed into the drive. 


Army Giv^eu Aid 

The Philippine Army has decided to help l:he 
constabulary in wiping out the dissidents in Central 
Luzon, the department of the interior announced this 
morning 


Silayan said that one rebel 
leaped out onto the road and 
ordered the^ first velucle to >'op. 
The bandit ordered Maj. Gen. | 
Rafael Jalandoni, former chief ; 
of staff of the Philippine Army, 
out of the auto, and struck him ^ 
in the head with the butt of his , 
rifle. 

Gen. .Talandoni collapsed, Si- 
layan related, and this was fol- 
lowed immediately by burst of 
machine gun and small arms 
fire from men hidden in hushes 
along the side of the highway. . 

The gunfire instantly killed 
the occupants of the first few 
cars of the group,. Silayan re- 
ported, while the other motor- 

wm 


f 


tlve joint operations will be for the purpose of 
“ending it all,” referring to the lawlessness in Cen- 
tral Luzon. 


The aid of the army was decided at a conference 
between President Quirino and Secretaries Ruperto 
Kangleon of national defuse, and Sotero Baluyu_t of 
the iriter-ror yesterday, the^department of the interior 
disclosed. 


Sometime today, Majo^Genera.1 Majjan^ 


heda. chief of staff of the Philippine Army,' 
duled to confer with Secretaries Kangleon and La- 

luvut. 


Meanwhile, all flags on government ^buildings 
and plazas were ordered at half-mast by the

The Armed Forces of the Phil-

ulary. Brig. Gen. Calixto Du^ue, 
AFP deputy chief of staff, urged 
a drastic ‘‘zoning"' program in the 
dissident area for total extermi- 
nation of the Huks. 


Suspicion brewed among solons 
today that the fatal ambuscade 
was a deliberate idan^ to m 
Mrs. Aurora Quezon and' her 
family by former tenants on the 
Quezon family’s Arayat hacienda 
who have turned Huks. 


Meantime, an opinion was ex- 
pressed that disgruntled former 
tenants of the one-time Quezon 
hacienda in Pampanga were re- 
sponsible for the outrage. 

Indications were shown that 
the ambuscade was deliberately 
planned for the extermination of 
- the Quezon ^mily.

The sneak attack took place 
in barrio Salubiisob, 62 kilome- 
ters away from Bongabon, Nue- 
va Ecija, Col. Macario Asistio of 
the PC disclosed this morning 
as he left for the ambush scene. 

Information reaching PC 
headquarters said that about 300 
■ dissidents participated In the 
ambush. They were led b:^ 
Commanders Viernes, blarzon^^ 
hupo, and Mulong. 

A combined PC-AFP force 
estimated at 1,600 is participat- 
ing in the manhunt. Reports 
that PC troops had (fontacted 
the fleeing dissidents were con- 
firmed this morning. No de- 
tails were available although 
“fighting was in progress.” 

TanKs at the PC headquarters 
compound and in the Southern 
Luzon Zone command in Balara, 
Quezon City, were ordered last 
night to proceed to Nueva Ecija. 

About 1,000 PC troops from the 
1 st combat oattalion were alerted 
for the all-out offensive against 
the Nueva Ecija dissidents. 

Gov. Juan O. Chioco of Nueva 
Ecija ordered town mayors, police 
Bgencies. and civilian guards in the 
province to press the manliunt 
for the ambushers. . 

Rep. Justiniano Montano (L, [ I 
Cavite), today whipped up con-!-' 

^ gress seaxtiment for immediate ^

the constabulary as th 0 govern- ’ >

ambuscades that culminated in a i ! 
'near-massacre of Mrs. Aurora. 
Quezon’s party yesterday. 

Rep. Manuel Soza (L, Cebu), 
eaid ^‘the sentiment in congress' is t .

Othe^* solons, particularly Reps.- 
Eduardo Barrette (L Laguna),; 
pacifico Lim (L, Sorsogon), and- 
Pedro Munoz (L, Batangas) urged 
a probe of the PC commands in 
Cabanatuan and Quezon. 

They said that the PC troops 
there should have cleared the way 
first for the party, knowing the 
highway was very unsafe and lit- 
tle used because holdups and kill- 
ings were frequently . committed 
there 

Senators and congressmen led 
the countiT in expre.ssing shock 
and grief at yesterday’s tragedy. 

Senate President Mariano Je- 
gus Cuenco. mourning the death 
of Mrs. Quezon and others in the 
hands of Huks. declared the gov- 
ernment must continue without 
letup its war against Huks and 
bandits. 

Last night PC headquarters an- 
nounced that a constabulary force 
had contacted the ambush band 
near the scene of the attack. A 
pitched battle is in progress, it was 

Senator Pablo Angeles David, 
one time governor of Pampanga, 
cwid one of the arch enemies of 
the Hukbalahaps, said that know- 
ing the Huks as he does he is in- 
clined to believe that the band 
which ambushed Mrs. Quezon and 
her. party are members of the 
Hukbalahaps and not mere ban- 
dits as the PC chief would want 
to believe. 

“I do not think the Huks would 
• not ^have attacked if they knew 
that the party was that of Mrs. 
Quezon. As far as I understand 
the Huks, they are out to kill 
anyone who are not one of their 
i kind. Anybody who is not a mem- 



At 


Mrs. AURORA A. QUEZON 

ber of the organization is a want- 
ed man,” David declared.' 

David blames the poor intelli- 
gence system of .the constabularj^ 
for being ignorant of the move- 
ment of the dissidenits. specially 
the Nueva Ecija command “who 
should know what is going on 
within their territory.” 

The Pampanga senator took a 
dig at his political rival, Interior 
Secretary Sotero Balu^iit. for 
making the people believe that 
peace and order has been restored 
in Central Lu^n, 

Only officials like Baltiyut who 
have not lived in Central Luzon 
cal, that the Huk problem is 
solved, he said. • 

conversations with PC 
lief Alberto Ramos this morning, 
advocated an all-out offensive 
apmst dissident elements and 
leave no more quarters this 
tune,” he said. 

“If the Hukbalahaps speak no 
other language but force, the gov- 
ernment must speak the same lan- 
guage to make itself understood” 
he emphasized. 

Zulueta, 

m an interview with the Evening 
News, said peace and order in the 
country was “artificial.” He sLss- 
ed that peace cannot be restored 
Tf wavering pofiev 

of the department of the interior, 
^lueta castigated “officials in 


the government charged with the 
duty of restoring and maintaining 
peace and order and who, through 
their pronouncements, have blind- 
ed ‘the people into believing that 
peace and 'order has been re- 
stored.” 

Zulueta’s statement was prompt- 
ed by the killing of Mrs. Quezon. 
The SPC boss is the godson of 
the late President and Mrs. Que- 
zon. His eyes moist with tears, 
Zuliieta refused to talk further on 
peace and order “lest it might be 
misinterpi’eted as a political 
.stunt.” 

He scouted talks that Huk 
groups are now disorganized, say- 
ing they are as well-organized, if 
not better organized now than be- 
fore. The SPC chief said he had 
pleaded with officials to tell the 
people actual peace conditions. 

Of Mrs. Quezon’s death, Zulue- 
ta said: “I mourn her death deep- 
ly. Tlie late President and Mrs. 
Quezon w^ere to me, like my own 
father and mother.” 

The death of Mrs. Quezon 
caused immediate political reper- 
cussions, with President Quiiino’s 
candidacy suffering the brunt of 
adverse effects. 

Quick to see a strong point in 
their fq^ or, anti-Quirino elements, 
led by suspended Senator Jose 
Avelino, and Nacionalista bigwigs, 
mth Minority Floor Leader Cipria- 
no Primic.ias leading the attack, 
assailed the administration’s peace 
and order campaign and indirect- 
ly blamed Quirino for the death 
of Dona Aurora. The attacks 
centered on Quirino’s recent fire- 
I side chat, delivered less than two 
I weeks ago in which the President 
; declared that peace and order has 
; been completely restored through- 
' out the country. They pointed out 
that Quirino’s statement was .not 
a true picture of the peace and 
; order situation and gave citizens 
a false seiLse of security. 

I Even the man on the street, 
commenting freely on Mrs. Que- 
zon’s death, showed um'estrained 
contempt . for the government’s 
peace and order campaign and in- 
I creased hatred for dissident ele- 
ments. Taxi drivers talking among 
themselves as th^y hurriedly sip- 
ped their morning coffee in cor- 
ner Chinese stores, low-salaried, 
government employes riding in 
' jeeps on their way to office, labor- 
ers trodding the sidewalks and 
hugging their meager lunch wrap- 
ped in yesterday’s newspaper to 
begin the day’s toil, housewives 
goTng to market with their buri 
bags or baskets, — all sported 
gloomy faces and were of heavy 
heart. They, too, expr^sed bitter- 
ness oyer the failure of the admi- 
nistration to suppress banditry 
and lawlessness in the country. 

With such a strong current of 
adverse public opinion against the 
failure in the peace drive sweep- 
ing the country like a prairie fire 
on a .summer day, it is generally 
believed that Quirino’s chances of 
reelection will be greatly set back. 

Meanwhile, the lower house met 
in early session at 3 p.m. to enact 
a resolution of condolence over the 
death of Mrs. Quezon and her 
* daughter. 


that he had converted this into a- 
'model farm for the tenants to owm. 

After liberation, hov/ever, Mrs. 
Quezon and her children sold this 
hacienda to the Rural Progress ad- 
ministration for P600,000. 

It was possible, ether solons 
; averred, that change in ownership 
! worked towards dispossession of 
I some tenants. These must have 
become disgruntled and turned 
Huks, carrying resentments against 
the Quezon family. 

Even Hilarion Silayan, w^ho was 
with the Quezon party, disclosed 
today his belief that it was a 
planned attack. 

The Huks apparently knew Mrs. 
Quezon because the Huks even ut- 
tered her name and pointed her! 
out to other companiens as the I 
lady with the white hair. 

Silayan disclosed that the am- ; 
bushing Huks let pass two jeeps I 
heavily loaded with PC soldiers 
before stopping the cavalcade 
headed by Mrs. QuezonS car. 

The sudden appearance of the 
two PC jeeps when firing started 
prevented Huks from mowing ^ 
down the other members., of the 
Quezon motorcade, 'Silayan 
averred. 

Brig. Gen. Calixto Duque, APP 
deputy chief of staff, said this 
morning he advocates “zonifica- 
; tion” of Huk areas to apprehend 
I the killers of the Quezon family. 

1 “There ca(n be no half-way 
Imeasures now,” Duque added. 

* ‘lliey have proved that they de- 
serve to be killed one by one.” 


Foreign Undersecretary Felino 
, Neri today declared that since the 
Bongabon tragedy in w^hich Mrs. 
Aurora A. Quezon and companions 
lost their lives became known, the 
department has been continually 
swamped by messages of sympathy 
and condo ience from government 
and private sources abroad. The 
goodwill and friendship that the 
Philippines now enjoys with the 
other nations “is in a measure due 
to the foundations laid down by 
the late President Quezon especial- 
ly during the war years,” he said, 
Among the first foreign govern- 
ments to transmit diplomatic notes 
of condolence was Australia. The 
Australian note was lianded this 
morning personally to Neri by 
Consul-General John K. Waller. 
Its full text follows: 


“The Australian Government ' 
and People have learnt with deep 
horror of the "murder of the wi- 
dow of yrur beloved leader. The 
death of one who has played such 
a part in the development of the 
Philippine republic and who was 
so intimately connected for uiany 
. years with its most historic mo- 
iment is a bereavement which will 
be felt by every Filipino. We join 
with you In mourning the loss of 
one who was beloved by all w^ho 
knew her.” 


After brief eulogies the solons 
adjourned to attend the funeral. 

The solons. he'^ded by Speaker 
-S Eugenio Perez, heaid mass offered 
,;by Monsignor Sancho for Mrs. 

, Quezon, Baby Quezon, and Philip 
LiBuencamino III, Mayor Ponciano 
• Bernardo, and other victims at the 
Santo Tomas university chapel 
: this morning. 


Rep. Vicente Logart?. (N, Cebu) 
recalled that when the late Pres- 
ident Quezon was stiU. living, he 
had told tenants on their 106-hec- 
tare Arayat farm in Pampanga 


In the meantime, Consul Sofro- 
nio Abrera of the Philippine con- 
sulate at Los Angeles, California, 
cabled the home office that 
all the Los Angeles newspapers 
i played up in “banner stories” the 
[tragedy, recalling how the late Pre- 
jsident Quezon and his family made 
their home at Los Angeles during • 
the last war. Filipinos and Ameri - 1 
cans in Southern California shared ‘ 
a common .sorrow, and at the same ; 
time strongly urged strong reprisal ! 
measures against the authors of j 
the gruesome tragedy, according to ! 
Abrera. 

The Neri statement follows:

The Ambuscade. 
How It Happened: 


More Photos On Ambuscade 


A reconstruction ot the 
cade on Mrs. Quezon’.s Party ^ 

' gleaned from reports of the “V®- 

ning News correspondent, in u 
Ecija and from accounts of eye- 
' witnesses follows: wnq 

The site of the .sneak attack was 
:;in barrio Salubusob on a bend 

•^on the Villa Aurora _ zigzag 
;-,Bongabon. It was near the ap- 

' proaches to Baler and within 
l\va Ecipa province. in.qn 

" The ambush was .sprung at 10 
I yesterday morning. 

1 The Quezon party was 
cade of several cars including two 
' jeeps bearing constabulary men on 
: security detail. The Party was 
(bound for Baler to attend cere^ 

1 monies for the nnveihng o 
marker which marks the birth- 
place of the late President Quezon. 

Mr.s. Quezon was in the f hst car, 
a Buick sedan owned by Mayor 
Ponciano Bernardo of Queozn City. 

At the wheels was Lt. Col. Antonio 
San Agustin. assistant manager of 
• the Philippine Charity Sweep- 
^ stakes office. Seated on his rieht ^ 
. was Philip Buencamino III and to 
Philip’s right was Baby Quezon. 

Seated in the rear were Mrs. 
Quezon, who was right behind San 
(Agustin. Maj. Gen. Rafael Jalan- 
Idoni. retired AFP chief of staff (in 
center) , and Mayor Bernardo. 

The second vehicle was a jeep- 
with a constabulary guard detail 
under the command of Captain 
. Olimpio Manalang. Pedro Payu- 
mo, Mrs. Quezon’s cook, was in 
this car together wdth Cpl. Ray- 
mundo Silverio and other consta- 
bulary personnel. 

Third came a jeep with Juan 
Molina as driver. Beside him was 
seated Col. Primitivo San Agus- 
tin, .chief of the military intel- 
ligence section, G-2, AJPP. Seat- 


ed behind were five constabularv

men . 

The fourth vehicle v;as a sta- 
tion wagon owned by Mrs. Quezon 
with Teodulo Villadelgado. No- 
nong Quezon’s driver, and two pas- 
sengers whom the driver was un- 
able to identify. These passengers 
v^ere killed. Villadelgado escaped 
' unhurt. 

The fourth car was occupied by 
Dr. Eduardo Quisumbing, Dr. 
Francisco Bigornia, Dr Luis Alan- 
dy, and Mrs. Amparo A. Angara. 
Mrs. Quezon’s sister. 

PACSA Director Hilarion Sila- 
yan’s car was originally the third 
car in the line but was delayed by 
two flats on the way and at the 
time of the incident was trailing 
two kilometers away. 

The party left Cabana tuan early 
in the morning atjataout .5, o’clock 
and. at 10:30 reached a bend where 
there ’i^as a, man standing in the 
middle of the road motioning them 
to stop. 

. Ma^or Bernardo, sensing that 
1 some danger was afoot, shouted 
I that the party was Mrs. Quezon's. 
This was answered by a sudden 
volley concentrated on the first 
car. All persons i.n the car were 
killed except Jalandoni and Buen- 
camino, who was badly wounded, 
in the chest. The attackers thenj 
rushed at the car and as Jalandoni 
was making an effort to pull out 
his gun and fight he was hit on 
the face with a rifle butt and was 
downed unconscious. The general

said that when he came to, the| 
bodie.s of Mrs. Quezon and Baby! 
Quezon were slumped on top of 
him. Apparently the Huks mis- 
took him for dead. 

Indications are that the bodies 
of all the occupants cf the first 
car were dragged outside, and; 
shorn of all jewelry. Jalandoni 
was divested of a signet ring and 
his wallet. 

After the first volley which 
crippled thQ 'leading car Huk fire 
was concentrated on the constab- 1 
ulary guards. Capt. Manalang and 
, ; Cpl, Silverio were able to escape 
;; death by jumping cut of their jeep 
4 ^; and taking cover under the vehi- 
I cle. Manalang was wounded in 
j the left leg and arms while Silve- 
rio, who said he feigned death, was 
; ] wounded in the right leg. 

■J.V . ^ - • » 


The attack was so sudden, ac- 
cording to Jalandoni, that the 
guards had no time to fire ''back. 
As far as reports indicate, only 
. three armed forces men survived 
the ambush, Jalandoni. Manalang, 

' and Silverio. The rest were killed, 
j The identity of the ambush gang 
i as Huks was confirmed by drivers 
‘ of the Cabanatuan Lumber com- 
pany who were ambushed on the 
same spot earlier. The drivers ,, 
said that they were detained by 
the Huks until the attack on the 
Quezon party was over, following 
which, they were released. One 
' of the Huks, the drivers said, told 
them: “Go now as your white- 
haired Mrs Quezon is already 
. dead.” ! 

1 The driver of the -fourth car was • 
; quick enough to back up his vebi- ! 


cle, make a TJ-turn and ^ 

awky to safety and bring news 
the tragedy to Cabanatuan. 

Several other cais at the tail of , ^ ^ 
the party also were able to make . 
a getaway. In one of these was , 
Director Silayan who sped to Bo- 
ngabon and was able to ask Capt 
Dominador Alo’s A Company, 1st 
combat battalion, PC to rush to 
the scene. 

Seeing the reinforcements 
come, the attackers scampeied 
away. The bodies of the dead and 
: wounded were then gathered and 
taken to Cabanatuan. 
s News of the ambuscade reached 
j Col. Angel Magallanes. provincial 
comniailder, while he was confer- 
ring with Governor Juan O. Chio- 
c.o yesterday noon. Magallanes 
immediately left taking along all , 
available reinforcements and , 
rushed to the scene of the am- 1 
bush. I 

Chioco wired Secretary Sotero 
Baluyut for a reconnaissance 
plane to be dispatched to the area. 

The wounded arrived at the Ca- 
banatuan provincial hospital by i 
mid-afternoon. A serious problem 
of blood plasma supply faced the 
, doctors. Jalandoni made an ef- 
' fort to get a plane and fly Buen-

at Mrs. Oiiezoii. Tlie cry failed 
to stop the splutter of machine-

to ask for .the imposition of mar- '

Thousands Grieve as Bodies

A nation bowed its. head in grief yesterday as Mrs. Aurora 
Quezon, her daughter Baby and her son-in-law ^Philip Biiencami- 

r»r» irr wpnf fn rliPii' ■finsil I'oofinrv ..-.1 ^ .n . 


JjAST a IKW. — J‘..ag(*r to see tiie ra.skefs of uie tnree virtniis ot 
tlio ainhusciule a.s they were about to be i>Ia<*ed at their final 
resting place in the Xortli t'eimUpry, young and old clung pre- 
i..carionslr to the railings of .some graveyard. Hundreds upon 
Imndieds lined the streets along whicli the funeral ]>ro<*essio!i 
]>assed and more were at tfie cemetery to attend the last necnM 
logical rites in honor <»f the three. 


“ The remains of the three — in- 
[noe.ent victims of a nameless 
— were interred side by 
side in the family plot at the 
North Cemetery Where the late 
President Manuel Quezon is en- 
tombed. 

Three hu-idred thousand peo- 
ple turned out yesterday either 
to take part in or witness the 
funeral cortegjb as it wended its 
way slowly and solemnly from 
the University of Sto. Tomas 
chapel to the cemetery. 
dent Qiiirino walked part of the 
way immediately behind the fu- 
neral van. A great number of 
cars, estimated at no less than 
1,000, formed part of the pro-. 


As early as 2 o'clock in the 
afternoon, thousands upon thou- 
I sands gathered at the UST 
; grounds, lined up both sides of 
the streets where the funeral 
‘ would pass and filled the North 
Cemetery. The blazing sun beat 
down mei'cilessly on the milling 
crowd. But they stood their 
ground . and wSitea patiently. 
Leaving the chapel at 4:30 o- 
clock, the cortege reached the ce- 
metery at QXSLctly ^ o'clock. 

At exactly 4 p.m., President 
Quirino accompanied by his 
daughter Vicky and aides-de- 

camp arrived at the U.S.T. cha- 
pel and knelt down before the 
chair which was especially pro- 
vided for j)im. The President 


was the principal pall bearer for 
Mrs. Quezon. In the morning, 
the President attended the re- 
quiem mass. He went direct to 
the chapel upon his return from 
Baguio.. He left the chapel fol- 
lowing the mass to meet his ca- 
binet at Malacanan. 

There was some difficulty at , 
the Quezon family burial j 
grounds. The crowd kept pour-' 
ing in and ..he police and cons - 1 
tabulary soldiers spent quite a* 
: time pushing their way in and 
clearing the way for the cortege. 

Suddenly, there was a hush 
and silence, broken only now and 
; then by a sti fled aob. The peo- 
'“pie bowed their heads as pall-' 
bearers carried In the caskets 
[one by one to the strains of 
(“Nearer My God To Thee," play- 
jed by the constabulary band. 

{ Mrs. Quezon's remains came 
[first. Draped in a Filipino flag,, 
iher casket was laiid a few feet 
[from the gate of the Quezon bu- 
rial grounds to await her daugh- 
ter and Philip. Baby’s coffin 
was carried by members of the 
; Ylac, an organization of young 
ladies of which she was the pre^- 
sident; that of Philip by his fa- 
ther, sister and 'close relatives. 

As soon as the three casket.Sj 
, were laid side by side. Bi.shop 
Rufino Santos of Manila took 
his place at the head of the cas- 
kets and conducted the burial 
services. President Quirino, 
former Speaker Jose Yulo and 
other government officials and 
] relatives of the dead stood on 
•the opposite side. 

After ^he biers were blessed, 
the pall-bearefc once more lift- 
ed Mrs. Quezon casket and car- 
ried it to the niche that was 
still wet and soft built beside 
that of her husband. At exact- 
ly 6:15 it was slowly pushed in- 
to the crypt. 

Then with their eyes dimmed 
by tears, Baby's co-members of 
the yiac, lifted her bier and 
•slowly carried it to her assign- 
; ^ed place on the far end of the 
lot. Philip’s turn came later. 
'Baby’s and Philip’s tombs were 
built side by side. 

At 6:20 the crowd slowly dis- 
;persed. still with bowed heads. 

Among the early arrivals at 
the cemetery yesterday were 
’Minister Thomas H. Dockett, 
Col. Andres Soriano, and top 
i^hilippino and United States, 
government officials. 

1 Also seen among the thick 
-*'c]foWd were Mrs. Trinidad L. 

Roxas and her daughter, Ruby, 

‘ and the two. surviving Quezon 
children, Maria (Ninl) Que^on-

Fue entonces cuando se me ' 
ocurrio pedirla una entrevista pa- "T 
ra La Voz de los Domingos. A 
la primera oportunidad y esto fue 
hace una semana, me presente en ' 
las oficinas de la Cruz Roja y : 
pregunte por Dna. Aurora. Me 
respondieron que aun no habia 
vuelto de Baguio. Deje entonces 
mi nombre y el encargo de que 
hicieran el favor de avisarme tan 
pronto como llegara, pues queria 
que me arreglaran una en- 
trevista con ella. Me prometie- 
ron hacerlo. 

Pero Dna. Aurora ya no volvio. 

Una bala traidora arranco de 
su cuerpo la vida que le era aun 
tan necesaria, que tan preciosa 
era para su pueblo. 


Activa y energica siempre, Dna. Aurora, como Presidenta 
de la Cruz Roja Nacional, no cesaba en su labor en pro de esta 
organizacion humanitaria que tan dignamente encabezaba.

Asi debio haber comenzado poco 
mas o menos, esta entrevista con 
Dha. Aurora A. de Quezon, de 
haberse llevado a cabo. Pero des- 
graciadamente no fue asi. No me 
cupo tal suerte. 


Y es triste pensar que manos 
filipinas quitaron la vida a esta 
filipina ilustre que qui^o tanto e 
hizo tanto por su Filipinas^. . Nos 
queda el consuelo, sin embargo, 
de que los asesinos de Dha. Au- 
rora son un puhado de hombres 
sin ley, y que todo el pueblo, 
dolorido, llora hoy la muerte de 
su primera Primera Dama. . . 


La ultima vez que vi a Dha. 
Aurora fue en una de las con- 
ferencias que dio en Maiula el 
Dr. Blanco Soler, el eminente me- 
dico y conferenciante espanol. 
Hacia milcho que no la veia y 
esta vez me dejo hpndamente im- 
presionado. Nunca, con anterio-

digna, tan llena de encantadora 


Y que del brazo otra vez de su

Woman Sense 

The Viewpoint Of A Filipina 

By PVRA SANTILLAN CASTRENCE 


It is very ironical that members 
of the family of the man who so 
articulately enunciated and so sin- 
cerely worked for social justice 
in 'the Philippines during his life- 
time should be the victims of peo- 
ple purportedly fighting to carry 
out that principle. President Que- 
zon's name was inextricably linked 
with the ideal of fairness and 
equity for the masses and Mrs. 
Quezon’s w'ork and interests 
showed that she shared that ideal. 
Mrs. Pecson was right when she 
said that her assailants lost a 
stout friend when they killed her, 
and 'the Philippines a great leader. 

Quite apart from the sincere' 
sorrow felt over losing such splen- 
did pillars of Philippine citizenry 


(and this includes ' the constab- 
ulary men and other members of 
the party, who died without being 
able to defend themselves), the 
nation's shock also stems out of 
the fact that apparently outlawry 
and banditry in this countrv have 
grown to such an extent that there 
is no safety of the road even for 
men and women of peace. The 
mention of Mrs. Quezon’s name, 
according to the radio reports, 
seemed to infuriate, rather than 
appease the bandits who became 
even more violent after hearing it. 

While saying a prayer for the 
innocent victims of that blood- 
curdling assault, the country may 
well say a prayer for itself too, — 
that it many eventually enjoy real 
peace within it.

HEN WE reedved the 
news of the Quezon 
ambuscade yesterday we were 
so sttinned that as we read 
the dispatches fi'om our cor- 
respondent in the provijnee 
we couldn’t believe it at first. 
As the hour dragged on and 
more dispatches flowed into 
the office, we still muttered 
to ourself : “It can’t be 

true.” 


And as we sat down before our 
typewriter, we didn’t even want to 
jlook at the column we’d prepared 
I earlier yesterday. We felt it^ to 
be out of line and out of time 
before thiiT national tragedy and 
we knew we had to write another 
one. 

* t m 

Wc hardly knew the people 
who lost their lives in the ambush, 
except perhaps from what we've 
read from the papers. Yes, we 
had met the soft-spoken, grand 
lady Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon, quite 
a number of times at the Phil- 
ippine National Red Cross head- 
ijj^uartcrs at San Rafael street. We 
remember the many occasions 
where she helped us get stories. 
But we also know that Mrs. Que- 
zon was not only kind. She was 
one of the most accommodating 
public figures we ever met. We 
never knew her to turn down any 
sports promoter who needed her 
lielp. That was how unselfish she 
jwas. 

* ♦ # 

Xs* for her daughter, Baby, It 
'was nothing more than seeing her 
from a distance. We used to see 
her every time there w^as an im- 
portant sports event at the Rizal 
Memorial stadium. We can’t eva- 
luate properly, lest we do her in- 
’(justice, how much she encoumged 
our sports' by lending her pre- 
sence, how she inspired some of 
cur tennis stars. We 'wall miss her 

I cheers and her laughter. 

* ♦ ♦ 

We remember how Baby used 
to make a late entry into the sta- 
dium with her sister, Nini escort- 
ed by Philip Buencamino ni. 
Everybody would look toward 
I their direction as they walked be- 
Ihind the long roiws of seats to 
!find their places among the 
crowd. And, oHentimes, the play- 
ers felt grand that the Quezons 

were present. . 

* ♦ • 

As for the late Quezon City Ma- 
yor Ponciano Bernardo, we knew 
’how sports-minded he was, 
through some of our friends. The 
' late Mayor Bernardo was largely 
responsible in promoting sports 
in Quezon City. He took time out 
from his official duties to inau- 
gurate basketball courts and lea- 
gues and almost eveiT sports- 
minded resident of the city look- 
' , ed up to him for support. 

♦ * ♦ 

These arc some of the people 
we lost in that ambuscade whose 
loss Philippine sports will mourn.

Oh 


By H. Q. BORROMEO 


Now it is too late to mourn. It is too late to explain. The 
woman we revei*ed so much and whom the people held so dear 
to their heart is dead. Explanations, promises of swift and im- 
T^iacable justice, will not bring* her back to life. 


Huks or plain bandits, w^hat difference does it make? The 
government cannot shirk its responsibility. It was mass murder 
in cold blood, made possible because of the failure of the govern- 
ment to restore peace and order despite assurances by its spokes- 
men that ‘'it is now safe to travel in Central Luzon.'’ 

The question we ask is why. Why did it have to be the innocent 
to sacrifice their lives and whose deaths could not possibly serve their 
murderers any good purpose? 

If the killers were Huks-, they might have had an understand- 
able reason for using violence. But violence employed against the 
innocent against the widow of the man who had dedicated his own 
life to ibe same fundamental cause for which they now claim to 
fight. . , that cannot be explained. If they must resort to violence, 
there are so many we have in mind on whom it could have been 
used to the lasting benefit of the country. 

If the killers were plain bandits, in search of loot, the less rea- 
.son was there for such an orgy of bloodletting. The victims would 
have gladly allowed themselves to be stripped of everything of any 
value in exchange for their lives which could so easily have been 
spared. But killei-s maddened and driven to audacity by a sense 
of immunity from punishment derived from continued and so far 
successful defiance of duly constituted authority feel they can af- 
ford to be merciless. How long they shall continue to defy the 
goyernment, only the government alone can telL

In Memoriam 


Until ncnVy I can^t quite get over Philipps tragic deaths He xvas 
first of all, a very close friend of mine. I saw him married, and 
was one of his best men at his wedding. I also satv him hurted, 
and it is not a pleasant thing to remember. 

Philip was such a nice, clean boy, friendly, warm-hearted 
generous, so full of life and laughter, that I learned to love bim. 

Of course he had his faults, but you* take your friends as tl^y 
are, not as you would want them to be. And Philip, for all nis 
faults, was quite a man. In all the years that we kept close to- 
gether, I never knew him to deliberately do a mean thing. 

Because he was by nature easy-going and amiable, he exaspe- 
rated times by failing to take things more seriously and 

using his considerable talents to point out the many evils . 

^r aovlrmZnt is cursed. Actually, he was not wholly indifferent 
to them. He could on occasions become quite

Mr. Quirino has much to answer for. These are the wages of 
impatient ambition, these are the wages of his double-cross of the 
Huks, and his brutal policy of extermination. Daily, in Central 
Luzon, innocent men, women and children die. caught between those 
two contending knights in shining armour, the Huks on one side, 
and the PC and their civilian guard allies on the other. Thousands 
have already died, and many more will die in the days to come 
now that Mr. Oilirino, in an effort to ease his troubled conscience, 
Insanelv cries all-out war. Whole barrios and pohlaciones w*ll again 
be shelled and blown to bits, there will be savage retaliation, and 
the bloody butcher’s list will grow long. It is ironic that a socially 
nrominent and beloved family had to be ^viped out before the whole 
mation woke up to the terrible and t'»'agic fact that Filipinos arc 
dying every day in bloody Central Luzon.

the death of Dona Aurora,, Baby, Philip and nine others who wei’c 
frapvrd in that Hiik ambuscade. Because of Mr. Quirino they went 
to Baler. Thry njent trilstina his boastful assurance as President 
and Comwander-in-Chief of all the armed, forces of the Philippines 
that peace and order has been comvlcteht restored, and they met 
their death on the highway, oiddled hy hidlets that were meant for 
Elpidio Quirino. 

The blame for this rests on the conscience of El^idio Ouirino. 
I hope it re^ts there heavily. God damn him, and God damn the 
men who killed my friend! , »

murder of ."Mrs. Quezon as more 
than the hilling of an innocent 
person, “it is a dastardly at- 
tempt to hill the nation”, he 
said, “for no nation can long 
survive without love, without 
charity, and if ever there was 
a person w'ho in our .gene- 
ration incarnated charity, love, 
kindness, It was she— -the sweet 
eom passionate lady whose me- 
mory binds us in prayer today". 

Father Ortiz who was the spi- 
ritual adviser of the Quezons 
■aLTomyanied the family from Ma 
nila to Australia and the Unit- ' 
(?d States. “Behind the man 
We all admired”, Father Ortiz 
continued, “stood tiie w'uman we 
all loved; behind the champion 
of social justice, stood the lady 
of charily, w’ho like a mother, 
kept 113 together; healed brok- ; 
eu friendships; bound up poll- i 
tical wounds, poured the oil of : 
compassion on the social ulcers 
o( our age, cherished and guar- ’ 
-•ded the sanctities of our homes."

Aurora when he said, “Her I 
name will be uttered in bene»

Aurora wiien he dedicated his 
hook The (Jood Fight thus: “To 
my wife and children, whose 
courage in the presence of the

Tlie Common Man Speaks On Ike ttlltZflll Tragedy 


• THOUGH it is now a week since the incredible murder oj Mrs. 
Aurora Quezon and 11 others by a band of Htiks, people in Manila 
and the provinces continue to express deep sorrow as well as burning 
indignation. A cross-section of public feeling is disclosed in the fol- 
lowing informal comments of citizens. They are reported by Staff 
Member Tij who overheard them in restaurants, buses, stores and on 
the street. 


“The Quezon massacre happened 
because our officials are not thinking 
of the people, especially the common 
tao. They think only of themselves, 
of how to rebuild their houses, of 
how to increase their wealth and blind- 
fold the voters at election time.” 

★ ★ ★ 

“The Constabulary are not the only 
ones to blame. High government of- 
ficials should share the blame. They 
themselves are waging war against 
each other. If these officials who 
should be the first to uphold the se- 
curity and welfare of the people are 
committing grievous blunders, should 
the low-salaried Constabulary soldiers 
be blamed for doing likewise?’^ 

★ ★ ★ 

‘‘The government is to blame. . .be- 
cause there would be no Huks and 
bandits if the people were contented.” 

★ ★ ★ 

“The officials do not think of their 
countrymen. . .They think of nothing 
but their ovcm good. So what do the 
poor people do? They turn to law- 
lessness.” 

★ ★ 


“Mrs. Quezon was a mother to the 
Filipinos. Why did the Huks kill her 
when she was always domg good?” 

★ ★ ★ 

‘T used to sympathize • with the 
Huks but after what they have done 
to our first First Lady, 1 hate them 
now. ril even volunteer to fight with 
the Constabulary if my services will 
be needed ” 

★ ★ ★ 

“The Huks are ex-guerrillas who 
had been fighting for our country and 
at last they were not able to get their 
recognition and their backpay. They 
were not recognized because some 
racketeering employees in the govern- 
ment fooled them and stole the mon- 
ey intended for these recognized guer- 
rillas.” 

★ ★ ★ 

“Peace and order in our coimtry are 
just words.” 

★ ★ ★ 

“The only need now is to feed the 
Huks. Once they are fed, they won’t 
commit any harm.” 

★ ★ ★

The Cause 

Ralph Waldo Emerson has right- 
ly said that nothing is got for 
nothings that the effect is caused. 
The tragic death of Mrs. Aurora 
Aratron Quezon, which shocked the 
nation, is caused. What is the 
cause? What brought about the 
effects? 

The answer to the thought pro- 
voking question is in the words of 
Senator Geronima T. Pecson who 
qaid: “Grieving was not enough for 
there must be something of greater 
import that must be looked into. 
Why was she allowed to the 
^ea without assuring her safety? 
There was dereliction of duty some- 
.ihere and it must be localized. 

In a similar vein, ex-Secretary 
Gntera B. Cabahug of public works 
communications ^observed: 
mother of the Third Republic 

= a Victim of official blindness. 
'^Ireliction of duty,” and “official 
v^P^dness,” significant words of the 
o fmoort, is the effect of the 
Jellyfish attitude of the

In Memorsam 


OurGreatestTeacher 

These words and this our deep 
grief are hopelessly futile and 
inadequate to express the great 
loss that we have suffered from 
Doha Aurora's tragic death. 
She was our ideal Filipina 
mother, the personification of 
everything that was sublime 
and noble in Filipino woman- 
hood. Her devotion to her fa- 
mily, her solicitude over the 
poor, her indefatigable efforts 
at social amelioration, her 
exemplary self-effacement, the 
soothing influence of her ra- 
diant and pleasing personal- 
ity, — all of these qualities will 
forever enshrine her in our 
hearts. The death of Mrs. Que- 
zon and Baby Quezon completes 
the martyrdom of the Quezons 
for the c/iuse of the masses. It 
is for us the living to emulate 
Doha Aurora’s glorious exam- 
ple, for her life truly made her 
the greatest teacher of us all!

IRREPARABLE LOSS 
Dear Editor: 

If President Quirino, in 
the words of. Justice Recto, 
did not stop being president 
in order to be the politician, 
we may still have the loved 
figure of Doha Aurora 
around us, the best symbol 
of Filipino w'omanhood. 

If President Quinno re- 
presented the peace and or- 
der situation as it should 
have been represented, in 
terms of security to the com- 
mon tao, however lowly he 
may be, and not in terms of 
public votes, the irreparable 
sacrifice of precious blood 
may not have been so bra- 
zenly exacted.

Dona AURORA A. DE QUEZON 
“Pure and spotless must the vic- 
tim be that the sacrifice may be 
acceptable.” . These words of Jose 
Rizal, naturally come to our minds 
in this hour of our national be- 
reavement. For Doha Aurora, ai i 
victim of our fratricidal hatredr. is ‘ * 
indeed a pure and spotless martyr. [: 
Divine Providence, has willod to ' 
demand from our country the mo.^it 
precious life of our citizenry. Let 
us hope and pray, that this our 
great loss will serve the great pur- 
pose of opening (he eyes and touch- 
ing the hearts of all our nationals, ^ 
that this fratricidal strife may be 
. put to an end. 1 

j Doha Aurora, will be remember- 
! ed by many noble deeds, but I like 
I to believe that our posterity will 
' consider that her appeal to the na- 
tion, through the Catholic Hierar- 
chy, for a month of May dedicated 
to our Lady Mediatrix of all Graces, 
hollow^ed with prayers and penan- 
ces, is her spiritual testament to . 
her beloved country, and as such 
the most significant of her good 
deedB. 

With the sacrifice of her life in 
the altar of her country, her ap--. 
peal acquired a very poignant j 
meaning. She had to die a-martvr \ 
of our fratricidal strifes, for us \o ^ 
realize that we are facing a .great ; 
national crisis, which demands 
from all of us, more prayers, 
penances, and a new w^ay of life,' if* 
thJs our beloved country of ours 
is to be saved.

T\T« remain^ of Mrs. Aurora Aragon de Quezon, her daughter 
;Mana Aur^a (Baby) and nine other victims of a Huk ambuscade 

brought to Manila last night in a 
funeral motorcade for interment in Manila as the nation slowly 
recovered from the shock of the first report on the ambush. 

1 -n daughter and members of her party were 

Kiilea on the Bongabon-Baler interprovincial road at 11:30 a m

Quezon’s motorcade had stopped and had 
Identified the party as that of Mrs. Quezon. Then the bandits strips 
ped the bodies of jewels and valuables. 

The widow of President Quezon met tragic death with loved 
ones and friends as she led a party of about 50 relatives and asso- 
ciates on a motor trip to Baler, Quezon, her hometown, to unveil the 
historical marker on the birthplace of President Quezon and to attend 
the town fiesta and the inauguration of the Baler hospital. 

The party was approaching Villa Aurora, still on Nueva Ecija 
soil, and was passing through a zig-zag road on hilly terrain when 
the leading cars were subjected to heavy enfilading fire. 

Quezon City Mayor Ponciano Bernardo, who was in the leading 
car with Mrs. Quezon, Baby Quezon, Maj. Gen. Rafael Jalandoni, 
Philip Buencamino III and Antonio San Agustin, left the car with 
his hands up in token of surrender and shouted: “This is Mrs. 

Quezon’s party.” He was shot dead as he yelled. 

As all cars screeched to a stop, men swarmed around the leading 
car. When Gen. Jalandoni saw the outlaws, he grabbed a .45 caliber 
automatic pistol and was cocking it when an outlaw struck him on 
the cheek with the butt of a rifle. As he dropped to the floor of the 
car, he heard volleys fired into its occupants.

Upon being intormed of 
e(jy^ the President took the fol- 
lowing measures: 

1 He ordered former Speaker 
^ose Yulo to serve as his personal 
■ representative and 

with Secretary of Justice Sabmo 
Padilla. Executive SeCTCtary Teo.- 
V doro Evangelista and Secretary of 
-National Defense Ruperto Kang- 
leon to make immediate arran^- 

- ments for the temEKirary cust^y 
' of the remains of the victims. 

' -This would indicate that the Pres- 
ident will formulate more fitting 

' arrangements for the dead. 

- 2. The President called upon 

- General Mariano Castaneda ana 

- - General Alberto Ramos to summoif 

aH the available forces for a imi- 
J* dress campaign to eliminate tne 
> bandits in the Nueva Ecija area. 

3. At the same time the Pres- 

-"-ident ordered Secretary Evange- 
lista to mobilize all possible assist-^ 
ance to the wounded. 

-V The President was said to have 
i expressed the belief ihat the^^- 
sailants were not Huks. - The 
president reportedly said he could 
. not believe that Hulcs meant to 
'--do any harm to lilrs. Quezon be- 
; cause she was loved even by them. 

First official reports from Gen- 
; eral Jalandoni received in Mala- 
cantan said that the ambuscade 
V occurred between 10 and 11 yes- 
^ * terday morning beyond pie Que- 
" ' 1 zon boundary about 60 Idlometers 
r.from Bongabon, Nueva Ecija. 

According to a wire from Gen-| 
eral Jalandoni, the “highway rob- 
- . bers had all gone after they have i 
- ' looted us.“ ' 

y Acting on the orders of the Pres- ' 
^ ident, Secretary Evangelista mob- 
: ^ ilized the Red Cross and the Phil- 

- ippine Air Force to fly blood plas- 
r , ma and other medical supplies to 
' Cabanatuan in an army plane. >■ 

At the same time arrangements 
^ ^ were made to convey blood sup- 
" ply from Clark Field by a U.S. hel- 
icopter to Cabsinatuaii after the 

- U.S. army authorities had volun- 
teered to assist. 

It was understood Mrs. Quezon

; April 28. — ^Mrs. Quezon, widow of 
the late President Quezon, and 10 
others, including her daughter, 

’ Babyi and son-in-law, Philip 
' Buencamino III, were lulled when 
they were ambushed by a band of 
1 no less than 100 armed Hukbala- - 
haps at 10:30 o’clock this morning | - ‘ 
near the boundary of Nueva Eci- j 
^Ija, and Quezon provinces, about 
H 62 kilometers east of Bongabong. 

General . Jalandoni is the lone 
^-survivor in the car of Mrs. Que- 
;izon. He related that when the 
i ambushers came near the car he 
' was given up - for idead a}so be- 
^ ^ i cause he was buried under the 
bodies of the Quezons, Mayor 
[ Bernardo and Tony San Agustin. 

‘ He said he regained consciousness 
when the PC troops led . 

jor Burgosino Fausto started iir- - 
' ■ ing at the outlaws who then re-]£ 

>. ^ treated in disorderly fashion to- 
■ awards the Sierra Madre moun-| .. 
tains. ‘ 

A strong PC reinforcement v 
’ from Cabanatuan and Bongabong f

sued the fleeing dissidents, ac- i

fighting was still going on, one ^

Mrs. Quezon and her party were 
reportedly on their way to Bqler, 

Quezon, to attend the town fiesta . 
there and at the same time to 
witness the inauguration of the 
Baler hospital. - 

Immediately upon reaching Que-

Quezon party. About 20 other 
cars which comj/osed the long mo- - 
torcade returned towards Bonga-

Occupants of the two other ve- 
hicles who escaped unhurt were 
Hilarion Silayan, director of the 
PACSA, Dr. Francisco Vicuna, 
chief of the Quezon Memorial hos- 
pital; Dr. Eduardo Quisumbing 
and several others. 

Reports of this incident created 
a stir .here. Some informed 
! sources blamed the present Liberal 
party squabbles in the Senate for 
ha\dng failed to give due atten- 
tion to the worsening condition in 
Central Luzon, especially in Nueva 
^ Ecija. . 

Governor Juan O. Chioco who 
rushed to the scene of the am- 
bush with Provincial Board Mem- 
ber Sixto Ilustre wired the Pres- 
I ident and the secretly of the in- 
terior about the incident. 

! Meanwhile the news of 
:tal killings spread like wildfire 
■throughout the province. PL 
' troops had a difficult time, keep- 
J ing thousands of people from 
i crowding at the provincial hos- 
‘ pital as they clamored to have 
; a glimpse of the body of Mrs. Que- 
zon and her daughter. Ray- 

mundo Bernardo, brother of the 
slain mayor of Quezon City, was 
speechless. 

Philip Buencamino HI died at 
the provincial hospital before he 
. could be taken to Manila by plane 
for treatment of his wounds. All 
! the victims were taken to Manila 
j late today as government forces 
intensified their pursuit of the 
Huks responsible for the ambush. 

Those who were able to escape 
" to Bongabon said that almost the 
entire force of the 1st combat 
team, headed- by Capt. Dominador

ambush. Lt. Col. Angel Magalla-

By PACIENCIA TORRE- GUZMAN 

In Baguio, last Friday, I talked 
' with Mrs. Aurora Aragon Quezon. 
It was siesta time when I barg- 
at the Quezon home on Le- 
street. She was , wearing a 
navy wool dress and all smiles 
when she came out on the terrace 
to find my photographers already 
in possession of the place. She 
crinkled her eyes at me in good- 
■ . ' ^ nature'd response when I told her 
I was lucky to be able to feature 
^ : her Baguio home in an Evening 
' News article. 

I recall now that almost her 
- very first words to me were, ^‘I 
going down tomorrow because 
I sni going to my home town.** 

: /' ' She ushered me and my two 
photographers to the living room. 
She lifted a vase here, an. ash tray 
’ there, moved a floor 'lomp hearer 
to the piano — she was all help, 
despite her daughter Nini*s fears 
-' -■' - that she was unnecessarily strain- 
ing herself. 

She took me to an oil painting , 
^ in the dining room. Mrs. Quezon , 
- pointed to me painstakingly how' 
^ every known Philippine fruit was: 
included in the painting . This 
V was Presented, she said, to the late,; 
■ President Quezon by Dr. Eduardo;i 
Quisiimbing, one of those in the’; 
. tragic party, on the President's 
birthday on August 19, 1941, just'! 
befor i the outbreak of the Pacific 
. war. 

What she relished narrating 
' about the painting was how it is 
the only reminder left of their fa- 
mous Pasay home which burned 
down during liberation. The paint- 
ing, Mrs. Quezon said, was snatch- 
_ ed by a Swiss gentleman from the 
burnliig house, and carefully roll- 
ed in a bamboo tube which the 
/ ■ nice gentleman carried with him 

to Switzerland to re^ore later to 
Mrs. Quezon. 

The painting is very dear to 
- -- Mrs. Quezon. She would gaze at 
‘ ’ it from- afar and leaf over precious 
memories from a happy past. 

We remarked at the soothing at- 
mosphere of permanency even in 
this vacation home, at which she 
again crinkled her eyes and smil- 
ed serenely as if to say, “That’s 
has always been my pattern of life 
—permanency, stability in any- 
thing T do.** 


A 1 ill collector ►'jame, whom she 
attended to with dispatch, saying, 
“I alv ays pay my bills in Manila, 
but if you say so, 1*11 pay you now.** 
Whicn she did. 

A service tray borne by a maid 
passed by on the way to Baby*s 
room where Lulu Reyes was be- 
ing entertained for lack of room 
space in the living and dining 
rooms which were for the moment i 
in complete possession of the pho- 
tographers. Nonong came out ana 
wanted to know if Doha Aurora 
was *:ot going along wdth him to 
attend Benediction. Nonong saun- 
tered out, and Mrs. Quezon took 
me to her bedroom to show me 
proudly her new altar with its 
new reigning image, the Lady of 
Fatima. 

Her room was a mess, she' was 
packing up for this fatal trip. 
Again she said: “I am leaving 

tomorrow, I have to visit my home 
town. This she said with much 
happy anticipation I T.inderstood . 

I knew what it meant going back 
to the old homestead. 

She pushed aside her shoes 
which were lined in a row prepa- 
ratory to going into shoe cases. She 
steered aw^y her grandson’s crib 
to give room to the photographers. 
“My grandson rooms with me,** 
she remarked. It was then I saw 
for the second time that after- 
noon the framed snapshot of 
gran‘tmother and grandson in 
close filiak communion resting on 
her d.resser. The camera froze 
the two just as the grandmother- 
ly kiss was being firmly planted 
on the chubby cheeks of gurgling,, 
inipish. 15 -month old “Pongoy** 
(as Mini teasingly calls her first-; 
bom.» * j 

Ea**iier in the afternoon, Nini; 
and her husband Philip showed 
me this photograph while we were! 
watching the photographers get 
busy on the terrace. 

It is a photograph the whole fa- 
mily is proud of. It is a portrait; 
of a golden life lived as the Lord 
commands. To me, that photo- 
graph best symbolizes the close- 
knit family life Mrs. Quezon had 
consistently maintained from the 
early years, through an unmatch- 
ed n.-itional career as wife of a 
people’s leader through the eter- 
nity of bereavement and on to the 
seren-^ days when ner grandchild- 
ren were beginning to come to 
give her joy in old age. 

Mrs. Quezon took off some two 
houi’s from her packing to attend 
to us. We apologized. And to our 
”feliz viaje*' she again crinkled 
her eyes and smiled the gracious 
we all knew.

chapel for the Quezons and 
Buencamino III beginning at 6 
a,ni. High requiem mass was 
sung at 9:30 by Msgr. Rufino 
Santos, bishop of Manila. 

From the UST chapel to the 
main gate of the UST campus 
.. the pallbearers will be members 
of the committee on arrangement, 
composed of Justice Jose Yulo 
chairman; Dr. Manuel Uim, 
vice-chairman, and Sec. ^imi- 
tivo Lovina, Senator Uorenzo M. 

' Tanada, Rep. Tomas B. Morato,

tonio G. Sison, and Aurelio In- 
tertas.

The remains will pass through 
the UST gate to P. Noval, P. 
Campa, Espana, P. Paredes, Que- 
zon boulevard, Azearraga, Rizal 
avenue, Blumentritt and into

Mrs. Qyezon 
Laid To Rest 


Under an overcast sky yes- 
/terday afternoon, a mournins 
nation buried tbe mo&t revered 
woman in the country, her 
daughter, and her son-in-law — 
innocent victi^ns of a brutal Huk 
ambuscade. 

The remains of the three, 
Mrs. Aurora Quezon, Baby Que- 
zon, and Philip Buencamino III, 
were laid in final rest at the 
Quezon family lot in the North 
Cemetery where the Tate Pres- 
ident Manuel L. Quezon Is en- 
tombed. 

As early as 2 o'clock in the 
afternoon, crowds began gather- 
ing on the UST grounds, lining 
the streets through which the 
funeral cortege was to pass. At 
4 o'clock. President Elpidio Qui- 
rlno, his daughter Vicky, and 
aides-de-camp arrived at the 
UST chapel. The President was 
the principal pall bearer for 
Mrs. Quezon. 

The cortege left the chapel 
at 4:30 o'clock arriving at the 
cemetery at 6 o'clock. Police 
and PC soldiers had difficulty 
at th© burial lot clearing the 
way for the procession. 

A hush, broken only by stifled 
sobs, suddenly fell as the pall 
bearers approached with the 
caskets, to the strains of “Near- 
er My God to Thee," played by 
the constabulary band. 

The caskets were laid down 
a few feet from the burial lot, 
MrL Quezon's, draped in a 
Filipino flag; IBaby's, borne by 
members of the YLAC — ^the cha- 
rity organization of which she 
was the president; Philip’s, car- 
ried by his father, sisters, and 
relatives. After the blessing, gi- 
ven by Bishop Rufino Bantos of 
(Manila, Mrs. Quezon's casket 
was lifted and laid into the 
niche, still wet, beside her hus- 
band's. Baby followed next, 
banked with flowers, her tearful 
friends her pall bearers. Phi- 
lip was last, his tomb and Ba- 
by's side by side. 

The crowd dispersed silently 
6:20, a few remaining to 
break off sprigs from the bloom- 
ing sbrubs on the burial lot for 
niemeutos.

lELL them I am Viernes.’ 


. -..vcr there was nee.l for selfless service: ann.iifj the teucli- 

1 he iawyers 


Yes, you are Viernes. You are a 
little god with a great big guu 
on your hip. Originally you had 
a Cause with- which few of us, 
considering ourselves decent, had 
quarrel; but you have grown big- 
ger than your cause and now you 
are Viernes and you boast of wo- 
man-killing. Off and on there is 
drivel that “it was not the Huks.“ 
No, it very likely was not the Huks 
as an organization, but ceUainly 
it was some of the Huks in an or- 
ganization running amuck for lack 
of leadership control. Definitely 
it was Viernes, so proudly claim- 
ing credit for his armed prowess... 

Down here in the lethargic low- 
lands, Viernes, there is a moral 
and mental evasiveness which 
avers we didn’t do it, you didn't 
do it. “they” did it. . • “they” 
indicating the imaginary margin 
for banditry. Thus we play pol- 
itics with the devil. Thus we 
avoid saying anything nasty about 
the likes of you lest we ourselves 
get a bullet in the back. The word 
for this, of course, cowardice, 
the language not having changed 
since the days the guerrillas scout- 
ed for and held the camps you 
now use. But a people can become 
only so afraid, Viernes, then no 
more; once the saturation point 
is reached, you will still be Vier- 
nes, yes, but the people will be 
The People. 

Though we of small stature 
(fannot answer for a nation, each 
human, in name of^humj 


can answer for himself, and by 
that token I for me. You . acclaim 
yourself one of the “little people” 

— the exploited tenant, the under- 
paid laborer, the nameless men^ 
and women in millions as against 
the unjustly favored few. As one 
of the “little people,” you have 
spoken with blind and final hat- 
red in the merciless murder of 
Mother Quezon, Baby, Philip, Ber- 
nardo, the others 1 may not have 
known personally but whose lives 
were equally precious. Nor have 
their nunian rights been more 
savagely denied, than the .ives 
of men, women and children slain 
in bloodv continuity through four 
years of pretended peace. 

Think you. Viernes, that all the 
“little people” are you? How about, 
me, and the millions like me? We 
have known labor in the fields, _ 
dishwa.shing in restaurants, th| 
picking and packing of fruit. W< 
are the little people^ too. come'^ 
earlier to maturity perhaps than 
you. Perhaps our fight for the 
same things is longer and harder 
but. God aive u*; strength to keep 
it 30, cleanejr. We reason with 
ideas, not with bullets. Bullets 
are for defense against aggres- 
sors. not for our brothers, not 
for the few truly noble in an ad- 
mittedly contemptible landlord 
(^ass, certainly not for those 
hundreds of simple, ignorant, 
struggling workers men like yon

In your ego, you natuiuliy think

wish I did not know, they weep 
for ^ou. Hesitating on Nini's 
'Inor^tep, fumbling fqr words of

word of explanation. I cannot tell 
her why this had to happen, why

grieving is short-lived. For what 
ycrtT-have done to Nini. which 
nTT^fs what you did to all the rest. 
i hate you. Believe me. you can 
never hate me a.s I hate you. And 
ating you, I bless the memory of 
oionel Roberto Mata who hunted 
down and killed in a cornfield one 
of us wlib committed highway rob- 
bery: I cherish the memory of 

Colonel Leon Z. Cabalhin, who 
tried and executed a rapist; I am 
even bumble before Marking 
whose headquarters was not only 
.1 guerrilla military school and 
hospital but also a reformatory 
where he personally by a combi- 
nat ion of persuasion and force 
-nade his followers into “gentle- 
man .fighters or I’ll break your 
goddam head. ’ I might quarrel 
with his languagfB^ but never with 
ojs results. 


If Quezon were Alive, he would 
rip down the £ence. toes the sit- 
ters to their sides, talk votes with 
voters, say it with bullets to k U- 
ers. Kor crime, corruption, for 
the distressing bad behavtor 
in the highest offices in the land 
he would turn this our beloved 
countrv upside down to -set t

Who first fought for Social 

Justice? Who went to you un- 
der the burning Pampanga sun, 
through the .Mufioz floods, to the 
farthest outposts to see you. hear 
vou. help you? Who had long 
conferences with that other great 
man, Pedro Abad Santos, and for 
hours stood before a hundred 
thousand of you at a time m sim- 
ple, honest debate? U was neither 
politics nor patience; it was for 
love of you. 

He knew about the creek dam- 
med by a rich man to make a 
fishpond at the expense of living 
water for hundreds of your fa- 
milies along the dried water- 
way... He knew about the caci- 
que's usurious wife and the 10- 
.•eiitavo bottle of niercurochrome 
she debitted against you for P2.- 
00. He knew how insufficient 
your share of the crops and, too, 
how barren the earth for so many 
mouths. . . I know he knew, for 
he allowed me to study reports 
meant only for him and his Ca- 
binet and to study them only un- • 
der Vargas’ watchful eye lest I 
make off with one he would him- 
self study further; many times 1 
studied until 11 o'clock or mid- 
night ill V^argas' Malacanan of- 
fice. And who was 1? — just a 
cub reporter, for a long time with 
more of a haircut than a name, 
yet even 1 could ask this great 
man questions, even 1 could 
quench the thirst for knowledge 
with a President’s secretary my 
librarian. 

None of us was too humble for 
his attention, neither you nor I. 
.\s he helped an ignorant, eager 
girl, so did he valiantly help you. 
He knew that what you wanted, 
the familiar but barren land un- 
der your feet, was at best an emp- 
ty heritage, so he pointed you 
to new land, to virgin land, and 
he loaned you the money to go, 
gave you NLSA' supervision, fo- 
cused national interest on you. 
Ho you think the landlords were 
bapTpy to have him ease you out 
of your bondage? He stood strong 
and alone in his humanity, and 
for this vou slew his family. 
Your own revered Pedro Abad 
Santos would cry out against your 
savagery. Wherever the gentle 
old bachelor lies in his hero’s 
grave surely his heart must ache 
for his political children who have 
become what? 


All through a great President’s 
years of service. Mother Quezon 
helped her husband and in that 
capacity was our first, and last. 
Lady of the Hand. Wherever 
there were those in service to 
country, she was there, not in self- 
glorification but in assistance to 
him and to them. . . among the 
teachers, the nurses, the writers, 
the welfare workers, the lawv^ers^

to whom she gave her life, only

Baby was the girl who should 
have been a boy. For her who 
is dead and cannot herself ask. in 
what w'ay did Baby harm you? ^ — 
by blasting public indifference to- 
ward the lepers’ misery? sweat- 
ing for funds for the Ylac slum 
schools? cramming law into her 
head, the better to carry on her 
father’s work? a fragile body, 
driven by an untiring spirit? 
Baby’s sharp tongue and cutting 
wit were only for us i n u r- 
ed to it, understanding and lov- 
ing her for it. Never did she jab 
at yo\i, to whom she was fiercely 
loyal, ft is even possible that she 
was a friend to me because slie 
considered me one of you. “Hi,” 
she w'ould say, /‘How's Yay the 
Underprivileged? Madrigal still 
overworking and underfeeding 
you?” And if I mourned my fi- 
nancial state, she would jibe, 
“Don’t be stupid! Strike!” 
Though the years, I was grate- 
ful for her frankness, for her 
rough, unpitying, challenging 
friendship, for her equality and 
because once, when we quarrelled, 
and she stamped her foot and 1 
stalked out in anger, when I 
reached the office she was on the 
telephone to apologize - . . 

Philip, too, is dead. What dra- 
matic irony that you butchered 
him. For Philip and Baby were 
your open door to a half-million 
hectares of free, virgin land. . . 
Only one other person knows what 
Haby and Philip knew - that 


there was a place for you to go. 
land for you, a new start. I’haJ 
person is Judge Barrera. He 
knows. Ask him. 

U started in the time of Pres- 
ident Roxas, the time when peo- 
ple, despite atrocities, gave you 
the benefit of the doubt. They 
could not see what Roxaa saw 
then, that the language you un 
derstand is the language of vio- 
leuce. They had no quarrel with 
your i'.ause, and only a doubt as 
to your methods. Fatuously they 
thought that secretly siphoning 
vou out of congested areas, spirt- 
ing you away under the noses of 
the soldiers, leaving them with 
nothing to fight and thereby sav- 
ing their lives too, would rescuse 
you from the circumstances of in- 
justice and hunger which justi- 
fied your desperate rebelHoi. 

It was so agreed. Baby and 
Philip would let you know if and 
when... 1 would point where. All 
your prohlemms were being con- 
sidered — food, tools, instruction, 
tree medicine, schools, markets for 
your produce, immunity from the 
past . . . 

It is your friends you have 
killed, your friends more than 
mine, more than anybody's. You 
snatched a necklace, and lost a 
loving heart. You tore a jewel 
from the one ear in the Philip- 
pines that would still listen to 
you. You poured bullets into frail 
Baby at the dawn of a legal career 
for the underprivileged. You 
mowed down a man who.. ailed 
out to you, not for himself 
those who defended you where 
you could not defend yourselves 
There is little loss in hating you: 
you cannot do worse to your ene- 
mies than you have done to yikur 
friends, — ‘i

Aurora Aragon Quezon 



WASHINGTON (By Air Mail) 
— The tragic end of Mr^,. Aurora 
Aragon Quezon and members of 
her family is truly a matter of 
universal sorrow. Beloved and 
respected by all because of her 
J own goodseK and 
jfe being the widow 
of the late la- 
mented President 
Manuel Quezon, 
even those who 
perp'etrated the 
dastardly murder 
must be sorrow- 
‘ <^4 ing now as they 
realize their fa- 
tal error in mis- 
identifying their 
victims, for sure- V. ATLLAMIN 
. ly Mrs. Quezon 
had not done anything #to them 
or to others of the common people 
fc - *• except what would be helpful and 
' advantageous to them. 

Mortal life is such a fleeting 
episode and so full of i uncertain- 
ties that while life lasts it were 
better to be happy by leading 
a useful and satisfying life that 
would earn the approbation of 
I j God and of mankind. Mrs. »Que- 
’ zon lived such a life and there- 
to fore she should be held up as a 
. model for other women to emu- 
i late. 

: I have met Mrs. Quezon in 

many different cities, but it was 
in Los Angeles where ! had long 
conversations with her. She en- 
joyed the charms and pleasant- 
> j ness of southern California in 
' * company with her three children. 
She occupied the house of her 
friend, Mrs. Pilar Hidalgo Lim, 
who, like her, is an outstanding 
^ leader of the Filipino people. 

Mrs. Quezon told me of her dif- 
^ ferent activities in which she put 
‘ ; her heart and soul. She con- 
• cerned herself with the welfare 
of the masses. Her ideas on pub- 
\ lie questions affecting them were 
\ simple and practical and showed 
a mind that was analytical. I men- 
tioned her efforts to increase the 
yield per hectare of rice on her 
farm in a talk I made to the fin- 
.ance committee of the United 
States Senate when it had under 
consideration the Philippine trade 
act of 1946. I was honoring her 
^ as a person with sound and prac- 
tical ideas. 

, By the press, I followed her 


Bij VICENTE VILLAMIN 


to Manila from the United States. 
She was a i>otent 'force In the na- 
tion, a dynamo of work, an angel 
of mercy, a faithful servitor of 
humanity and withal a mirror of 
natural modesty and democratic 
simplicity. Her memory will be 
cherished by the Filipino people 
from generation to generation. 

Her husband, the late first itres- 
ident of the Philippine Common- 
wealth, was a great and dynamic 
leader. By his genius and com- 
pelling personality he kept the 
government on an even keel and 
held the people together, galvaniz- 
ing and vitalizing their spirit of 
nationalism. Husband and wife, in 
separate fields of endeavor, 
formed a working team that func- 
tioned incessantly for the well-be- 
ing of the Philippines. 

The country has yet many 
anxious days to face. The bru- 
talizing effects of war on some 
j^eople are still untamed and un- 
diminished. A spirit of restless- 
ness is still stirring in the minds 
of the masses. To bring them 
back to normal is the first duty 
of government. Mrs. Quezon was 
helping powerfully in that task 
as a private citizen. The mur- 
derers got the wrong person when 
they slew her. 

The murderous incident is an at- 
tack against both the people and 
the government. And both of 
them must close ranks to repel 
further attacks. The President - 
of the nation must be solidly sup- 
ported to maintain law and order 
and to uphold the dignity of the i 
government. Every erring soul 
must be overwhelmingly convinced 
that every act of lawlessness and 
bestiality will be discovered and 
dealt with relentlessly. 

Mrs. Quezon’s fate should 
serve as a unifying force among 
the good people of the Philipjfines, 
irrespective of personal political 
differences and party affiliations. 
It should also serve to seeu: the 
soul of those few who believe in 
violence and cover the things that 
belong to others without earning 
them. 

Aurora Aragon Quezon, with ' 
members of her family and others, 
has departed from this earth. If 
every act of service and humanity 
that she rendered to others in 
her lifetime is represented by a 
beautiful rose, there will certain- 
ly be a mountain of beautiful roses

Pays Tribute To Mrs. Quezon 


, r , a, niunutam ujl utJciULUUl 

CIVIC activities since she returned sjTtibolizing her public life. 


f ■ S. 



While “everyone feels the poorer 
.because of her death,” yet “our 
people and our prosperity will be 
the richer because she has lived,” 
President Quirino said in his nec- 
rological speech during the memo- 
rial services in honor of Doha Au- 
rora A. Quezon given by the Phil- 
ippines National Red Cross at Ma- 
lacahan last night. 

Former Associate Justice Manuel 
Lim was another speaker at the 
gathering that was well attended. 

The President said in part: 

“Mrs. Quezon, devoted and at- 
tached to her husband as she had 
always been all her life, human 
enough to feel the immeasurable 
loss for her beloved husband’s 
demise, summoned all the courage 
and wisdom that she could muster 
from her heritage and determined 
to continue her husband’s life 
struggles while she lived. It was 
she who had served as the lever 
that had gauged the course of her 
husband’s public life. She had sta- 
bilized and steadied his movements 
and convictions as he had embark- 
ed upon his aggressive and com- 
pelling patriotic endeavors at the 
height of his strength, power and 
influence as leader of his people. 
The husband’s vicissitudes of for- 
tune in his great battles of life 
had made him turn his eyes upon 
the lot of the common man. But 
it was she who had touched and 
softened his heart and made him 
champion the cause of the masses, 
the underprivileged, the underfed. 
President Quezon’s social justices 
had been Aurora Quezon’s inspira- 
tion and passion. 

“But great as her influence had 
been, she had never abused it to 
further a justifiable personal pride 
when she knew that grave pro- 
blems of state were involved. She 
had asked nothing for herself. She 
had never - suggested that she 
would be sharing the criticism or 
gloiification of her husband’s con- 
duct even if it affected her feel- 
ings or dignity as the mother of his 
children. Nor had she minded be- 
^g dragged along up or down as 
her husband’s career had brought 
him higher or lower in the nation- 
al estimation. She had always 
risen to the occasion in the most 
helpful spirit. Because far and 
above her realization of some of 
her husband’s failings in his hu- 
man adventures, she had had ab- 
^lute confidence in her husband’s 
aevotion and respect for her. 
which she undoubtedly had in- 
spired by her conduct and her 


prayers. Quezon, the great manj 
and leader, became the greater be- \ 
cause of the inspiring influence V 
of Mrs. Quezon, the woman and 
wife. And Mrs. Quezon eventually 
became the rock of refuge and of J'i 
strength to many a Filipino lead-:^. 
er beset with , the burden of the ^ 
people’s problems. That she did^-^^ 
ail this quietly j^ritbin the private^ 
sanctuary of the home is a grate- 
ful fact and commentary on the 


womanhood of this country. 


■PM 






“Aurora Aragon Quezon was not ' 
only the first of the First Ladies i V 
of the land. In^er own right, she /h- 
was simply grand! The insuperable 
dignity, wisdom and grace with. 
which she carried her responsibi- 
iity to the nation after the death 
of President Quezop were no ac- 
cident; they came as the nature 
flowering of a lifetime of respon- 
sible, devoted and fulfilled com- 
radeship. When she undertook to 
head our National Red Cross, she 
simply acceded to giving formal 
confirmation, on her own right, of 
being in fact and in truth, mother 
to her people. She did not merely 
lend her name, great as it was, 
to the cause. She labored mightily, 
doing yeoman service like every- 
one else who belonged to - it, and 
provided its deepest, mast abiding 
inspiration. Our people may not^’j 
know now who was the greater, 

Quezon the Father of his coimtry, 
or Aurora Aragon Quezon, the tru- ; 
ly symbolic mother of her race. 

But history will record them both 
as the greatest benefactors of this 
generation, and Mrs. Quezon as 
the greatest woman in her coun- 
try. 

“The world has shared our peo- 
ple’s sorrow in her tragic passing. 

Those of us who knew her well can 
most truly say: to know her was 
to respect her, to admire her, to 
love her. No longer shall she gi*ace 
the halls of the land which were ^ 
wont to be exalted by her en- 
nobling personality; no longer 
shall welfare institutions feel the 
touch of her kind heart and hand. 

No longer shall these Palace halls |i 
be dignified by her handsome and ^ 

queenly figure; no longer shall 
these walls receive the impact of 
her gentle influence. No longer 
shall this atmosphere, which for 
many years she had enlivened with 
her wisdom and charm, be per- 
meated by her spirit of racial 
honor and pride — as embodiment 
of the noblest type of Filipino ■ ■ . 
womanhood.”

X' 




That Airs. Aurora A. Quezon 
was beloved by everyone was made 
evident last Thursday evening 
when moie than 200 people of al- 
most all nationalities residing in 
Manila flocked to the .Philippine 
National Red Cross blood bank to 
donate part of their blood. 

The tremendous response was in 
answer to the Red Cross appeal 
flashed over all Alanila’s radio 
stations for Type O blood urgently 
needed to help save the lives of 
those critically injured due to the 
Quezon party ambuscade. Earlier 
in the afternoon, the entire blood 
.Type 6 stock of the Red Cross 
was flown to the Cabanatuan prov- 
incial hospital where the injured 





were hospitalized. ' ‘ 

The an.swer to the radio blood 
appeal Hashed over stations 
DZMB DZRH, and DZPI was elec- 
tric Immediately after the first 

^ prospective 
donois started pouring into PNRC 
headquarters at the corner of 
Isaac Peral and Taft Avenue. 
Such was- Mrs. Quezon's prestige 
that even one woman, not know- 
ing that Che former first lady was 
dead, volunteered to donate even 
half of her entire blood thinking it I 
would save the PNRC chairman, i 

Only sixty among the many that 
registered, however, were classified 
as having type O blood.

Although many offered to give*.

CABANATUAN, April 28—, 
Philip Buencamino Ill’s last . 
words were “Dios ko!” He lapsed 
into a coma after uttering this ; 
cry and expired at 3 o’clock thi^ , 
afternoon. 

Earlier he had asked that his 
father, Dr. Victor Buencamino, 
be notified by telegram to Mani- : 
la. “Call a priest, I am dying,”- 
he said. He was.gi?ven the last 
sacraments of the Catholic •

‘ Buencamino v/as hit in the-j 
i chest and thigh but reinainedif 
alive for a few hours after heij' 
was brought to the ..provincial;:

Philip and Payumo were still: 

! alive when they were brought to]

Two injured in the ambush | 
^ are being treated in the provin-

were treated for minor injuries. 

An eyewitness to the ambush' 
who declined to be identified saidi 
Mayor Bernardo, came out of thej 
Quezon car with his hands up 
when the attack had begun and 
i shouted, “These are the Que- 
zons!”. Despite this, the eye- 
witness said, the r.ttackers con- 
tinued firing their machirreguns. 

PC e.scort soldiers killed in 
the ambush were Lt. D. M. Ara- 
; bejo, 'Lt. Diosdado Lazain, Cpl.

I statement here the attackers 
' were in a roadside ditch 'and 
; opened up on the Quezon party 
’ with a machihegun. The Quezon 
car was followed by a PC jeep 
in which he, Capt. Maniilang, 

,1 Lazam and two other soldiers 
I were riding. Three of them were 
j killed instantly hut Manalang 
I and Raymundo managed to jump 
I out of the vehicle. 

Ravmnndo said there was a 
• brief exchange of gunfire. He 
believed he was- able to kill three 
i| of the attackers. After the nm- 
! bush, the dissidents filed onto 
I the road, stripped the dead of 
1 jewelry and valuables, and 
: robbed the survivors. Raymundo 
said be feigned d^ath. probably 
, saving his life, and was picked 
up- by PC rescuers 15 minutes 
! later.

ceiveci the news of the massacre 
through a telephone call yesterday 
t p rnoo n . 

Mrs. Buencamino, courageous to 
-the last, called up Mansion House 
^'in 'Baguio for confirmation.^ She,-; 
;^next notified her brother Nonong) 
who was vacationing in Baclaran. 
Following that there was an end- 
Mess flow of friends of tlje family; 
and other visitors who "offered 
sympathy. : 

Mrs. Nini Quezon Buencami- ' 
no, here in Manila, learned ofi 
^Mhe tragic incident through 
^ phone call. Wanting to verify. 
^^_^§^she called up Mansion House, 

was informed that her mother! ' 
and sister Baby were dead. She?. 
Ihen relayed the news by' phone - 
her brother Nonong who had, 
gone to spend the day with Mrs. . 
^ Consiielo Cuyugan, tvhom the fam- ^ 
ily calls “Ninang.” 

Friends and relatives were on ■ 
v;hand to offer -what comfort they! 

^ could to the bereaved children of' 
the late Presidelnt Manuel Quezon. . . 
Among the first to call were ; 

3 Congressman Tomas B. Morato (L,

ip'the lot occupied by the late Pres-? 
Ident Manuel L. Quezon. 

Friends of Baby, especially YLAC! 
.girls who swarmed the Quezon re-r - 
I’Sldence, believed Baby had several;” 
premonitions about the impending.^ 
disaster. She told friends several' 
days ago that she did not know, - ; 
what it could mean, but that she* "v 
had been having dreams about hei'> - 
father for three nights. 

Some also said that she had jok-Hy 
ingly told them that she would getfe^C 
her insurance in order, and that^] 
she would not be around for theh?^ 
^next YLAC benefit as she would gof" ^ 
[to Huklandia and rest in peace.

Da. Aurora Quezon fue quien 
conmovio y ablando el corazon 
de su esposo el Presidente Que- 
zon, e impulso a este a luchar 
por la causa de las masas, y los 
desheredados de la fortuna, segun 
declare el Presidente Quirino en 
la oracion funebre, que pronun- 
cio anoche en Malacahan, en la 
velada necrologica celebrada por 
Da. Aurora, bajo los auspicios dc 
la Cruz Roja Nacional Filipina.

no de la Cruz Roja Manuel Lim,

se encargo del discurso de agra- 
decimiento.* 


Otros que hablaron en la ve- 


En su discurso el Presidente 
dijo: 

“La Sra. de Quezon, devota y 
apegada a su esposo, lo suficien- 
temente humana para sentir la 
incomensurable perdida por la 
muerte de aquel, reunio todo el 
coraje y sabiduria de que podia 
disponer de su legado, y se de^ 
cidio a continuar las luchas de su 
esposo cuando vivia. Fue ella 
quien sirvio de guia, que deter- 
mine el curso de la vida publica 
de su esposo. Estabilizo y afir- 
mo sus movimientos y sus con- 
vicciones, cuando se dedico a sus 
agresivas y patrioticas em^resas. 


en el pinaculo de su fuerza, po- 
der e influencia como caudillo de 
su pueblo. Las vicisitudes ddl 
marido en sus grandes batallas 
^ por la vida, le hicieron volver 
jlos ojos hacia la suerte del honv 
bre comun.. Pero fue ella la que 
! conmovio y ablando su corazon, y 
le impulso a ser campeon de las 
nm ras y de los desneredados de 
la fortuna. La justicia social del 
Presidente Quezon fue la inspi- 
racion y la pasion de Aurora 
Quezon.

VOZ DE MANILA, Miercoles, 3 de Mayo de 1949' 

SFilipinas, Piensa Y Despieria! 

Por J. M. CHICOTE 


Ha tenido que ocurrir una tra- 
gedia que afectara hondamente 
al pueblo filipino x^sira que este 
despei'tara de la somnolencia en 
que se encontraba con respecto 
al peiigro del comunismo en Fi- 
lipinas. 

Quiso tal vez la divina provi- 
dcncia ofrendar las vidas mas 
predaras y queridas del pueblo 
filipino para que cl archipielago 
d'tero se levantara indignado y 
demandara el castigo de los ver- 
dugos y la exterminacion total de 
ios disidentes que aqui los Uaman 
•^Hukbalaliaps*' y que en otras 
partes del mundo son mejor cono- 
cidos como comunistas, bichos as- 
querosos que han vendido sus al- 
Jnas a Rusia para derrogar go- 
bieAos constituidos por el pue- 
blo, crear el caos e implantar la 
**libertad'* del proletariado, esa 
“libertadV que en el diccionario 
del comunista significa libertina- 
je y defensa de unos principios 
tan bajos, mercenaries y nausea- 
bundos, que la iglesia catolica no 
ha tenido otro remedio que con- 
denar tan malefica doctrina, po- 
niendo en boca de su suprema ca- 
beza aquellas cinco palabras que 
encierran toda ima verdad: ‘‘El 

CX)MUNISMO ES INTRINSICA- 
MENTTn MALO‘\ 

El comunismo es un antrax cu- 
yas raices van poco a poco arrai- 
gandose en el cuerpo de una na- 
cion. Si no se extirpa a tiempo 
la afeccion, el cuerpo va decayen- 
do en salud y acaba ultimamente 
siendo victima de tan fatal enfer- 
medad. 

Vea Filipinas su porvenir en el 
espejo de otras naciones victimas 
del comunismo, que hoy gimen 
bajo cl terror moscovita, y deje 
aparte esas puntillosidades y re- 
milgos tan “suis generis*' en una 
democracia, paca que asi pueda 
facilmente atacar ese antrax que 
hoy empieza a extenderse por 
todo ei cuerpo del pueblo filipino. 

iMuerte y exterminio al comu- 
nismo! primero y ante todo, con 
armas, que son el bisturi que ha 
de extirpar el antrax que hoy nos 
qqueja, y despues, con ideas, doc- 
trinas e ideales sanos, que son la 
medicina que se debe aplicar para 
aplacar los dolores de la opera- 
Cion, atrayendo con ello ese gran 


numero de descan'iados, vicfinias 
de la ignorancia y equivocacion, 
pobres creyentos de las palabras 
de unos cuanto.s desalmados “je- 
fecillos” pagados con dinero de 
Rusia, que por treinta monedas,' 
venden su patria y abren sus 
fronteras al crimen y al desmem- 
bramiento nacional. 

jAbre los ojos Filipinas! y con- 
tempta esos cuerpos destrozados 
por las balas y piensa que otros 
mas caeran mientras tu no des- 
piertes de tu letargo. No des la 
mano a esos escritores que en la 
prensa justifican la actitud de los 
disidentes y que con el veneno de 
la tinta de imprenta, les animan 
a cometer mas depradaciones. 
Piensa que la Democracia nos da 
libeilad de culto, de palabra y 
de prensa, cuyas tres libertades 
no respetan los comunistas; pien- 
sa que el dia que estos se hagan 
fuertes, ardei'M las iglesias y ro- 
daran las cabezas de hiUes que 
no piensen como ellos; piensa que 
tu libertad, la de tus hijos y la 
de los hijos de tus hijos esta en 
peiigro de desaparecer. ;PIEN-'

El Senador Emiano T. Tirona 
declare que como ciudadano pri- 
vado leunentaba profundamente 
la muerte tragica de la Sra. de 
Quezon, la cual, siempre habia 
mantenido relaciones amistosas 
aun con los que durante el tiem- 
po del difunto Presidente Quezon 
estaban en la oposicion. La Sra. 
de Quezon fue la madrina de la 
hija menor del Senador Tirona. 
‘Mi senora y yo nunca olvidai'e-

que estaba gravemente enferma 
cuando fue bautizada, y tambien* 
por su afecto y atencion a nues-

Con respecto a Philip Buenca- , 
mino III, el Senador Tirona re- 
cordo que este fue . muy cortes y 
atento a los senadores filipinos, 
que asistieron a la conferencia de 
la union inter-parlamentaria en 
Roma. Finalmente expreso su 
profundo pesar por la muerte de 
Baby Quezon y otros miembros 
de la comitiva de Quezon, como 
el Coronel Primitivo San Agus- 
tin, el Teniente Coronel Antonio 
San Agustin y los Tenientes La-

El Comandante Eugenio To- 
rres, jefe del servicio secreto de 
a Policia de Manila, asigno ayer 
a un teniente y dos agentes secre- 
tos para que sirvan de guardaes- 
paldas de Nini Quezon Buencami- 
y de Nonong Quezon, en vista | 

i:>or^^^c anonimas recibidas 

iw los dos unicos supervivientes 
ue la familia Quezon. 

Los asignados ayer tarde por 
el Jefe Torres fueron el Teniente 
Giron y dos agentes. Estos se 
Qirigieron anoche mismo a pre- 
sentarse a los Quezon para la 
kasistencia de estos en las exequias 
jpunebre por Dna. Aurora y su 
I'lja Baby celebradas en la capi- 
lla de Malacanang. 

Las nptas amenazadoras, en las 
qua se decia que habia el plan 
de “liquidar" a toda la familia 
Quezon, se recibieron hace unos 
dias, por lo que se xnovilizo a los 
agentes de la NBI y la Constabu- 
laria alrededor de la residencia 
de los Quezon en Gilmore Ave- 
nue, New Manila. Ayer, el Ma- 
gistrado Manuel Lim pidio al Jefe 
del Servicio Secreto que, dentro 
de la Ciudad de Manila, se toma- 
ran las mismas precauciones. 

Aunque las agencies policiacas 
estan trabajando para lograr des- 
! cubrir la iden tided de los autores 
1 de la carta anonima, la teoria 
predominante es que la nota reci- 
bida fue escrita por algun sujeto 
que esta tratando de despistar a 
las autoridades, en relacion con 
' la salvaje emboscada, o para 
, amedrantar y mortificar a los dos 
hijos de Dna. Aurora por alguna 
razon personal. 


V Of Quezon Family 
Receive Threats 




The Philippine constabulary and ■ 

Quezon City police adopted secu- vf ^ 
rity measures upon receipt of re- 
ports that the surviving members _ / ^ , 
of the Quezon family were being 
threatened with harm by ‘'un- 
known elements.” 

Reports on the threats were re-^. ^• 
layed to the police authorities by 
Dr. Luis Alandy, a friend of the . . 
Quezon family and survivor of the 
Huk ambuscade on the Bongabon- ■ 
Baler road which claimed the lives / y_\ 
of Mrs. Aurora A. Quezon, her.\'*\’^ 
daughter Baby, her son-in-law > . 

Philip Buencamino III and nine 
others. • ’ ' 

Both the constabulary and the

Reports of Seatli 
Threats Berated 


The reported receipt of death 
notes by Mayor de la Fuenta 
and City Fiscal Fugeiiio Ange- 
les was described bv the Com- 
nninist party last night as an- 
other diversionary move of the 
administration to mislead the 
people from the real problems 
confronting the people today. 

Ihe death notes allegedly, 
mentioned that “your with-* 
draw'al of the charges against 
our leaders will not stop us to 
kill^ you." They evidently re- 
ferred to the charges of illegal 
association preferred by Mayor 
De la Fuente recently against i 
Mariano P. Balgos, secretary-*; 
general of th.e local Commun-^^ 

1st Party, and Guillermo Capa-? 
docia, and which have been;^ 
withdrawn from Fiscal Ange- 
les’ office. 

In a joint statement to the 
press last night, Balgos and 
Capadocia declared that "Com/ V' 
munists are not terrorists." 

They called the threat letters 
as "part of the world-wide pro- 
vocation of the reactionarie.s„ .yji . 
and Imperialist to smear and^ 
provoke the Communist par- 
ties." They said that its pur- 
pose is "to mold a public opi-' 
nion which will justify any act 
of gangsterism against the 
Communists and the progres- 
slves/’ '

For otro lado, las cartas ano- 
nimas amenazadoras se ban po- 
. pularizado en Manila, y tres fun- 
cionarios de la ciudad las ban re- 
cibido tambien en relacion cornel 
propuesto enjuiciamiento de jefes 
I comunistas de Manila. Los tres 
funcionarios arhenazados son: el 
Alcalde Manuel de la Fuente, el 
i Fiscal de la Ciudad Eugenio An- 
igeles y el Jefe Investigador Abe- 
lardo Subido. Los tres fueron 
amenazados de muerte, se presen- 
ten o no las denuncias contra Ma- 
riano Balgos, Guillermo Capafdo- 
- cia, y otros. 

: r "El retiro de las denuncias con- 
tra nuesti'os caudillos no ban de

son las palabras contenidas en 
//^;;las cartas amenazadoras. Al la- 
, , .// do izquierdo del final de las car- 
tas, esta escrita la palabra ‘Li- , 
bertad” y al lado dereebo "Eman- 1 
cipacion'"- 

E1 Alcalde Manuel de la Fuente 
habia retirado provisionalmente | 
' los papelcs denunciando a Balgos, : 
Capadocia y otros, por activida- ; 
des subversivas, pero despues las' 
YQjyjlQ a enviar al Fiscal Ange 
les para su revision. 


De la Fuente dijo que habia 
pedido al Fiscal AngeJes la revi- 
sion de las actividadcs del "Ea- 
tallon do Trabajadores" y de la 
"Asociacion de Vigilar.tes Contra 
Ataques Aereos" que estan enca- 
bezados por Balgos y Capadocia. 
Si las actividades de estas dos 
asociaciones tienen aigo de sub- 
versivas, la accion sera endosada 
a las autoridades nacionalcs, 
dijo el Alcalde. 

La cuestion de declarar sub- 
versiva una asociacion, segun Dc 
«n Fuente, esta en manos de la.s 
autoridades nacionales. Si estas 
lo declaran asi, entonces, pond re 
en vigor la decision, dijo De le 
Fuente. 

El Alcalde dijo taml ien quo la 
publicacion de la supuesta denun - 
cia contra Balgos y Capadocia, 
rra incorrecta, pero que habia sa- 
cado a la luz el hecho de quo 
los caudillos comunistas estan 
cobrando una cuota de P2.90 do 
los miembros de las dos asocia- 
ciones mencionadas, con el pre- 
texto de lograr el "back pay” de 
los mismos. El Alcalde De la 
Fuente dijo que el estaba dis- 
puesto a trabajar por el "back 
pay” de » los mismos, sin cobrar 
un centimo.

Manila, May 7, 1949 


The nation was plunged into mourning Thursday last week when tt 
learned of the tragic death of Mrs. Quezon, and 11 others in her part^ 
including her daughter, “Baby” Maria Aurora and her son-in-law Philip 
Buencamino III, while they were on their way to Baler, Quezon. It wa^ 
incredible that anyone should want to do harm to the kindly widow of thJ 
late President Quezon or to any member of her family. She was belove| 
bv the people not ohly because she was the widow of the great leader bii 
also because of her own character. 

Since her return to the Philippines after liberation, no longer the First 
Lady of the land, Mrs. Quezon had devoted herself to social welfare work./ 
At the time of her death, she was national chairman of the Philippine NaJ 
tional Red Cross. I
