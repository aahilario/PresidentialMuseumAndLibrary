CERTIFI GATE 


THIS IS TO CERTIFY that Lt. Colonel Jose Ozamiz 
of the Philippine Array was contacted by me In connection with 
the establishment of an Intelligence Net in Manila during the 
month of April 1943, and that as a result of my communications 
to him, he made a trip from Manila to Mindanao where he ar- 
rived 25 May 1943. 

This is further to certify that he was placed on 
active duty effective 25 May 1943, by Paragraphs 5 and 6, 

USAFFE Special Orders No. 48, dated 17 February 1944. He 
served as head of an Intelligence Net in the Philippine Islands 
continuously until apprehended by the enemy at Manila in Feb- 
ruary 1944. He was sentenced by the Japanese to life imprison- 
ment for anti-Jap activities, having been found guilty of es- 
pionage by a military court martial, and when last heard of was 
in prison at Manila during the month of December 1944. He was 
removed from prison and reportedly executed, although confirma- 
tion of this has not been posted to date. 

We worked together very closely and I know his work 
to have been courageous and efficiently handled at great risk 
to himself and family. He voluntarily took on this hazardous 
task, demonstrating a patriotism -which would well set a pattern 
to others of his country. He did this unselfishly and with 
utter disregard for his personal safety.
