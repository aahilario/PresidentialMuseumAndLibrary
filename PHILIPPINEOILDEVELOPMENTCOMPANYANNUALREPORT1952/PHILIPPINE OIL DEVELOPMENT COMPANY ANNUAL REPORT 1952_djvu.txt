ANNUAL REPORT 
FOR 1952 



PHILIPPINE OIL DEVELOPMENT CO. INC 



REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT FOR 1952 



TO THE STOCKHOLDERS: 

Since our last annual meeting we have made two more aftempt.s io discover a com- 
mercial oil field in the Philippines: one on the Bondoc Peninsula with funrls advanced by 
your General Managers and the other on Panay under the agreement between your C^om- 
pany and the Philippine-American Drilling Company, the partnership formed by my two 
sons and myself. Unfortunately, these drilling operations have not met with any more 
success than our previous efforts. Especially disappointing was the i-esult of our drilling 
on Panay where the structure v\'as ideal and the formations adequate in porosity — but 
yielding no commercial quantity of oil or gas. 

In addition to the following report on our drilling oix^rations, we attach reports 
by Mr, E. F. Richards, President of the Kern Drilling Corporation of Long Beach, 
California, and Mr. Benjamin Daleon, our paleontologist, wMth reference to the Panay 
operation. Also included is a report from the Petroleum Technologists, Inc. of Montebello, 
California, regarding the analysis performed on three of the core samples from our hole 
in Pana}'. 

OPERATIONS 

BONDOC DRILLING 

Drilling of Bondoc Well No. 4, using a cable tool rig, commenced Januaiy 18th 
1952. Progi-ess of drilling - comparatively slow when a cable tool rig is used ~ was delayed 
by mechanical difficulties, principally with resix.ct to casing. In the course of the drilling, 
gas showings with some traces of oil were observed at lo7 feet, and at from IMO to 450 feet. 

On March 9th, after the hole had reached a deptli of 450 feet and wliile welding the 
casing, a flow of gas set the hole on fire. The fire was brought und.r control and ex- 
tmguished after burning for ai.nnf h ir 

, . , ^^'"^^^^ ^^^'^ lioui'. Ak a result of the fire, lx)tli the eight-inch 

and six-mch ca>sings in the hn\r, ^^.u i 

^ ^me paued, and it was nocossaiv to pull them out. The upper 
section was recovered easilv [)iif n 

^ui iiHUmg out the lower portion presented a serious problem. 



2 



After careful consideration, the ^Management decided to stai-t. a new hole in the 
vicinity of the hole which had caught fire, using a small rotar}'' drill to speed up drilling 
of the hole from the surface to the objective; thereafter, changing to a cable tool rig. 
Accordingly, a Failing portable rotary I'ig was obtained on lease. 

Moving operations and installation of the rotar}' rig as well a.s haulage of equii> 
mcnt and supplies to the new location occupied the period from April 4th to I\Iay 7th. 
Drilling of the second hole, Bondoc No. 5, stai-ted on May Sth and reached a. depth of 
458 feet in the morning of May 24th, the drill having penetrated the fault at this depth. 
On hitting the fault, the hole stai'ted to cave in at a point 230 feet above lx)ttom and it 
was necessary to come out of the hole and go back into the caving area with other tools 
and start cleaning. At this juncture, however, the mud pump and hydraulic syst?em of the 
rig broke down and it was not possible to attempt to control the caving. 

Since we were still at the stage where the hole was shallow and it was, therefore, 
more economical to start a new hole than to tr\^ to overcome the caving problem, the 
Management decided to drill a fresh hole approximately 503 feet north. 

On June ISth, after new parts for the rig were obtained from the United States, 
the third hole (Bondoc No. 6) was spudded and drilling continued uninterrupted until 
reaching a depth of 380 feet on June 26th. 

At this depth, the drill stem ^^'as pulled out to change bit and while going back 
into the hole with a new bit, a bridge was encountered at 150 feet caused by the caving 
of a limestone stringer at 130. This bridge was cleaned out, however, and immediate plans 
were made to run 12'' casing past this area to protect the upper hole. 

While rigging up the cable tool to run this casing, additional hole was made 
with the rotaiy and a depth of 450 feet reached on the night of June 27th. As in the 
previous holes, showings of oil and gas were encountered at this depth. Driving of the 
12'' casing was started the next day but this pi-oved to be difficult and the casing could 
not be driven beyond 115 feet. Steps were taken immediately, therefore, to run 9-5/8" ca- 
sing to bottom for which the rotaiy was rigged back to clean tlie hole. Unfortunately, 
the bottom section of the hole started to cave in also and although three attempts were 
made to clean out to bottom, it was not }X)ssible to control the h(\aA'ing shale long 
enough to set casing.

In view of the recurrence of raving trouble in the holes rhillcd, it was docidcd 
to suspend drilling operation? in Bondoc. 

It will bo rocailod that our drilling operations in this area in 1918 and 19-H) were 
also handicapped h^' oavinp; shale. 

MA GNET OMCTEJi S URVEY S ' . . . 

Mr. James K. Dick, a lii;5hly competent technician from (''alifornia, was engagod 
by tiie Philippine-American Drilling Co., at its e.xpense, 1^. run magnetometer 
sur\'(^ys on your leases. During the period from Januaiy to June, 1952, ho carried 
out surveys in I'arlac, Pangasinan, Bondoc, Cebu, Leyte, Panay, and the TuHle Islands. 
The most interesting results were obtained iji tlie Iloilo basin, where the existence 
of three geological stnictures favoiable to the accumulation of oil was confirmed. The Phil- 
ippine-American Drilling Company solectcJ one of these structures, near the Afunicipality 
of Oton, to <irill a hole. ' 

PAXAY DHIIJ.IXC 

The drilling rig and equipment of the Philippine-American Drilling Company, which 
had been in storage at Cebu, were transferred to Iloilo during the months of October and 
November. .Vidilional drilling supplies were brought in from the United States. A 4-1/2 
kilometer ruad had to ))e constructed to vevich the location ill Oic.n. This road was com- 
pleted on December 31, 1952, and nu,ving of the drilling equipment into location and rig- 
ging up at site was started un January 1, 19.").3. 

The Kern Drillin- C-orporation of I.img Beach, California, was again contracted to 
provide the drillers and direct the .Irilling, and Mr. J.]. F. Riehards, Pn-sident of s,id cor- 
poration, arrived in the I'hilippines to supervise the operations. 

DrilHng of the hnk- began on January 2,)th. The <irill pass..] int., ti.e Ulian .Mud- 
stone lunualion at 201 feet. Seafaee casing was cenu-nted at 2()(; feet on Januaiv 21st 
and drilling resun.ed on January 23rd after the cement had .set properly and the lilowout 
Preventer was installed. \\e passed fron, tho Uliun Mudslone into the Idav Conglomerate 
formation at 1220 feet, and the fi,.t batch of core san>ples was taken wi,i. the IIOMCO 
sidew.'dl sampler woii-ing upwanl from 2000 feet to 1000 feet. 

Drilling, alternated with coring, continued uninterrupted till we reached a d.>pth of 



4 



5310 feet. At 2240 the drill passed from the Iday Conglomerate into the Tarao formation, 
and at 4179 from the Tarao into the Singit formation. Gas showings were observed in 
the cores at close intervals from 3926 down to 5310 feet. Oil showings were also observed 
in the ditch wliile drilling at 4540, 4S30, and 5030. 

On February 11th, while drilling at 5310 feet, the Pump Engine and Power Take- 
off broke down and it was necessaiy to make repau's. These repairs took a period of eight 
days, and drilling was resumed on February 19th. Gas showings conthmed to be in evi- 
dence down to 6340, but no additional oil showings were observed. 

A depth of 6354 ft. was reached on February 22nd. On coring back to 6200 feet, 
some caving occurred, and in cleaning out the shale and gravel, the drilling mud was 
reconditioned. On February 25th, after lowering the coring tool to resume the sampling, 
a strong flow of salt water entered the hole and it took 850 sacks of baroid to put the 
flow under control. This depleted our stock of baroid to where it was questionable if we 
could keep the salt water flow under control should it again occur. 

The decision of whether to continue drilling or not had to be seriously considered, 
for if salt water should flow bej^ond control into the nearby irrigation ponds, it would 
cause considerable damage to the sun-ounding rice fields. In weighing this problem, a 
determining factor was the evidence of basalt in the ditch samples from the bottom of 
the hole indicating that we were close to basement, i. e., the end of the sedimentary 
section. It was, therefore, reasonable to assume that we could evaluate the possibilities of 
the structure on the basis of the core samples and showings reported above. While these 
had occurred frequently, giving rise to some encouragement, they were not impressive enough 
to indicate a commercial deposit. Three of the cores were sent to the Petroleum Tech- 
nologists, Inc., of Montebello, California, for analysis. The result showed an oil content 
of only one percent of the pore space. It was, therefore, decided to abandon the hole 
and plug it so as to avoid causing damage to the surrounding agricultural area. This was 
done on the 26th of February, following which, we started work on removing the drilling 
equipment from the location. 

As from a geological standpoint the structure drilled was highly favorable for the 
accumulation of oil, being a domal anticline witli a complete closure, and the formations 
penetrated had sufficient porosity to allow the migration of oil, the reasonable conclusion 
is that a commercial deposit of petroleum or gas is absent from the area. In view of 
this, we cannot see justification in drilling tlie two other structures in the Iloilo basin.

SUMMARY OF DRILLING OPERATIONS ON A GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE 



NEAR THE MUNiCIPALITY OF OTON, ISLAND OF PANAY 

Dec. 24, 1952. The road was completed to location, and sand material for Derrick logs 
and Machinery foundation was btarted in on December 26th. 

Jan. 1, 1953. The erection of the derrick was started and completed January 5th. 
Seven da^^s were consumed in transporting drilling machinery and another eight days in 
installing same, making a total of 20 days for erecting derrick, hauling and rigging up drill- 
ing machiner3\ 

The well was spudded on January 20th with a re-run 18" bit, and this size-hole drilled 
to 207 ft. where 13-3/S'' surface casing was run and cemented to the surface on January 21st. 

No attempt will be made in this report to define cores or geology, which will appear on 
our Paleontologist Ben Daleon's report. 

One day was allowed for the surface casing cement to set. On January 22nd drilling 
was resumed with 12-1/4'' bit; this size-hole was carried to 2542 ft. At 2,000 ft. the Homco 
Sidewall Sampler was nm and cores taken back to 1053 ft., the upper contact of the Tarao 
section. At 2542 ft. the Iiole was reduced to IT' and carried to 3900 ft. with intermittent 
sampling back. At this depth a Reed, S-1/4'', Conventional Core Barrel was run and conven- 
tional cores w^ere taken through the contact of Tarao and Singit which occurred at 4179 ft. 
Conventional cores were carried on to 4231 ft. where drilling was resumed with 8-3/8'* drill bits. 

On Februar^^ 11, 1953 oiu- After Main Engine was found to be leaking excessive water 
in the Crankcase past the cylinder liner seals, and it was considered advisable to cut the 
engine out and repair same. This consumed 8 days, and drilling was again resumed on 
February 19th. 

At 5990 ft. the Reed Conventional Core Barrel was again run to check our position on 
structure and continued to 0018 ft. The core dips being flat proved us to be still in position 
on the seismic anomaly which only recorded to 1250 meters or 4100 ft., approximately 1900 
ft. higher. Drilling was again resumed and carried on to 6354 ft., which was reached on 
Febi-uary 22nd. At this depth, sidewall coi-ing back was started and taken up to 6200 ft. 
where mechanical trouble was encoimtered with the Homco Tool. This was corrected and a 
bit was run to clean out shale and gravel which had accumulated in the hole. During this 
process a partial new mud system was applied to the well. The bit pulled and the Homco 
Core Tool was again run on February 25th. At 4:00 A. M., just before sampling was resumed 
starting at 6200 ft., a hot salt wat(H" flow entered the hole probably from the 2,000 ft. level 
approximately, and 850 sacks of our stock of 1,400 sacks of Baroid Weight Material was con- 



12 



s-iiuunl in bringing it. under cuntrol. This v/as clone at 9:00 A. M. on February' 2oth. During 
this process the Blow-out Pi'(^vontoi>^ (E.G. P.) were closed and circulation broke out under the 
derrick floor in two places approximate!}' 10 and 15 ft. awa}^ from the well surface casing. 

This left us in the position of not having enough weight material to kill the water flow 
should it occur again, and liardly enougli to cam^ on drilling, as the hole was taking a reason- 
able amount of fluid which had to be supplemented from our limited stock of baroid on hand 
of approximately 550 sacks. 

Under these circumstances, to avoid the possibility of our well getting out of control with 
insufficient baroid to kill again, and as circulation broke through to the surface around our 
protective surface ca.sing, it was my recommendation that the hole 1)0 cemented and no chance 
taken on a heavy flow of hot salt water cratering out around our derrick and flooding the 
local fresh water creek and ponds used for irrigation in the vicinity. 

This was approved and blank drill pipe was run to 800 ft., and 500 sacks of cement 
mi.xed and pumped down and back up to 157 ft. as located by a bailer the following day. 
One more day was allowed for the cement to set hard, and on February 2Sth, the cement in 
the hole took the weight of the drill pipe at 164 ft., 42 ft. up in our 13-3/8'^ casing. Later, 
an 18 ft. bridge plug was put in at the top and a plate welded over the Iiole. 

CONCLUSION . In drilling the hole, one (1) Re-run 18'' bit was used to 207 ft; three 
(8) 12-1/4'' bits to 2542 ft. from 207 ft.; three (3) 11" bits to 3,900 ft. from 2542 ft.; four 
(4) S-1/4" Reed core bits from 3900 to 4231 ft.; and six (6) 8-3 '8" bits to 6354 ft. Two 
hiuidred and six (206) sidewall cores were taken at various intervals and thirty-eight (38) 
convention cores, likewise. Only six (6) tons of our 24 tons of Aquagel were expended, and 
approximately 850 sacks of Baroid. The major portion of our last shipment of supphes is still 
intact having used mostly old stock left over from previous operations. 

Thirty-three (33) days were consumed in drilling operations — from January 20th to 
February 22nd, wlien depth was reached at 6354 ft.-— with 8 days out for engine repair and 
one day cement time on surface casing, making 24 days actual drilling and coring time.

A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE GEOLOGY OF 



P.D.J.V. OTON NO. 1 WELL 



INTRODUCTION — The hole was spudded at 4,200 meters due north of kilometer 
post No. 16 along the national highway from Iloilo City to Tigbauan on the southern 
coast of Panay Island. It was located on the apex of the Oton Anticline. 

SUB-SURFACE GEOLOGY — Flat dips found on the conventional wireline core 
samples from the well confirmed the existence of a symmetrical, domal anticline penetrated 
by the drill bit at its apex. 

MICRO-PALEONTOLOGY — Samples from the well yielded abundant micro-fossils, 
predominantly foraminifera, comparable to the fauna of the original biostratigraphic standard 
type section on the outcrops toward the western foothills. The same fossiliferous highly 
organic, marine sediments formed the matrix for tiie micro-fossils of the bore-hole samples. 

STRATIGRAPHY — The drill bit penetrated tlie following formations, thus: 

Date Depth Formation Age 

Jan. 20, 1953 0^—50' Alluvium Quaternar>^ 

21 50^—150^ Cabatuan Tertiary Upper Z 

22-24 150'— 1220' Ulian " Lower Z 

" 25 '' 1220^—2240' Iday Tertiary Y 

" 26-Feb. 3 2240'— 4179' Tarao Tertiary X 

Feb. 4-23, 1953 4179'-6354' Singit Tertiary W 

The Basement Complex was not reached by the drill bit, but the presence of 
basalt pebbles in the ditch samples from bottom indicated that we were approaching basement. 

A total of 206 Homco Side-Wall core samples were taken during the operation. 
Ditch samples were also taken from the shakers eveiy ten feet of hole drilled, giving a 
total of 635 samples. In addition to these, 38 conventional wireline core samples were 
taken from 3900' to 4231' and 5990' to 6018'. However, cores were not taken from depth 
intervals: 0'-10o2'; 1294'-1956'; 1998'-2199'; 3081'.3899'; 4232'.4306'; 5229'-5989', and::6020'- 
6199'. 

OIL AND GAS SHOWINGS — Indications of gas were observed during the open- 
ings of the core barrels from depth intervals: 3926'-36'; 3971'-81'; 4016'-26'; 4061'-8r; 
4131^1'; 4171'.91'; 4192'.420r; 4221'.31'; 4271'-81', and 6009'.6019'. ' 

Positive cuts with acetone were also obtained from the Homco Side-Wall core 



14 



samples taken from iho following depths: -4467'; No?'; 4J47'; 4327'; 4317'; 5228'; 5223'; 
5208'; 5198'; 5L8S'; 517S'; 516S\; 515S'; 5148'; 513S'; 512S'; 5118'; 510S'; 5098'; 50S8'; 
5078'; 5068'; 5058'; 5048'; 4738'; 4038'; G340'; 0260' and 6240'. 

AVhile drilling through depths 4540', 4830', and 5030', evidence of oil was observed 
on the ditch. 

Both the Tarao and Singit Formations showed numerous alternations of stratified 
and impervious l)edp. 

Three ITomco vSide-Wall core samples obtained from a coi-alline lime and shale bed 
of the Singit Formation at depths 5188', 5148', and 5128' were sent to California for coi-e 
analysis. All showed excellent porosity and permeability, but practically no oil saturation.

Dear Mr. Henderson: 



Herewith is tlie analysis of the 3 cores you brought in February 17, from Panay Drilling 
Joint Venture well Oton # 1 in the depth interval 5118—5188. 

This analysis indicates good porosity and permeability, but practically no oil content. It 
is well known that side wall samples are taken in a region where drilling mud filtrate in- 
vasion has been a maximum, but in no case could this flushing action reduce the oil sa- 
turation to 1% of the pore space. Thus these cores do not indicate a commercial oil ac- 
cumulation. The total saturation is not low enough to indicate good gas production. The 
flushing would tend to increase the apparent total saturation on receipt at the laboratory, 
but even with this consideration, I would hardly bo able to interpret these total satura- 
tions as predicting commercial gas production. 

Sincerely youi's, 



(Sgd.) NORRIS JOHNSTON
