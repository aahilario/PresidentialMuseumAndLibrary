OFFICE OF WAR INFORMATION 
1 1 1 SUTTER STREET 
SAN FRANCISCO 4, CALIFORNIA 

May 8, 1945 



Major General Basilio J. Valdes 
Minister of Public Health 

Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines 
Manila, P. I, 

My dear General: 

In spite of the rush of things at San Francisco I think 
often of the days in Manila and particularly the enjoyable moments 
which you gave me, both with the Cabinet and in your home. I have 
talked several times with Joe Marias since my return and he was 
delighted to hear about you and about the chip-off-the-old-block. 
lie appreciates the interest that you are taking in the boy. 

I have not had much opportunity to spend time with your 
delegation at San Francisco. They are doing a solid job, as we 
are likely to express it over here. I feel sorry for these men 
who have to spend entire days thinking and talking about the 
legislative forms of the charter. They are devoting all their 
energies to it, however, and we, the common men of the world, will 
derive the benefits of their devotion. 

I wonder what progress is being made in Manila, It will 
take so long before the city will re-assume its pre-war character- 
istics. I know, however, that with the manpower of the Filipinos 
plus the manpower and resources of the Americans, there will be re- 
stored quickly the basic necessities of life. I also believe that 
with the transfer of shipping we will be able to import the where 
withal for more than mere basic necessities. 

Highest congratulations to your health officials for the 
prevention of epidemic diseases. Conditions were just right for 
plague and fevers, and I think it is nothing short of a miracle 
which has made possible the continued existence of masses of human 
being3 under such pathetic conditions without terrific toll of lives 
due to disease and Buffering. 



I suppose you have noticed the statement of President 
Truman that he is going to follow the course charted by President 
Roosevelt. Also an investigating commission will be out your way 
before too long. There are several Army men on the commission, 
some of whom I am sure will be your friends. 

We are looking forward to getting on with our information 
program in the Philippines and we are particularly hopeful that we 
can get more radio sets for Filipinos to enable them to listen to 
the messages which are coming from the United States. I believe you 
know Fritz Marquardt of our office there, and Monroe Hall of the 
United States Consulate. I am sure that at any time there is anything 
either can do for you or your Government they will consider it a 
pleasure to have you call upon them. 

With my very best wishes, I am 

Very cordially yours, 

Claude A. Buss
