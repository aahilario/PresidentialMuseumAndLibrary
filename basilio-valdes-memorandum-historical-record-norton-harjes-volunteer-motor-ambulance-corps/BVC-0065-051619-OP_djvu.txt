YIe are com'oiling a historical record of the NORTON HARJES 
vnimr tr MOTOR AliBUL-AlTCE CORPS and would ask each former member 
to let us hare a complete history of his work, during his service 
with that Corps, and also since leaving it The need of this 
personal record is certainly made greater by the loss of our Chief, 
and we would greatly appreciate every effort towards it. 

I would therefore request every man to indicate the 
follov/ing: -
