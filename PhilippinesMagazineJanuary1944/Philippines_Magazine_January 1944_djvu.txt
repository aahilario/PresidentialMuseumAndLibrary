EAST- WEST LINK 

It has been my life's work to promote and 
realize the freedom of the Filipino people, the 
recognition by the United States of their right 
to govern themselves, without disrupting the 
intimate ties between the American and Fili- 
pino people which have been so happily forged 
during the last forty-five years. In other words, 
I feel strongly that in the interest of both the 
United States and the Philippines, there should 
always be a very close relationship and co- 
operation between the American and Filipino 
peoples even after they have become politi- 
cally independent of one another. 

After the lessons of the present war, one 
would be blind indeed not to see that in "the 
world of tomorrow" the post-war relationship 
between the Republic of the Philippines and 
the Republic of the United States should be as 
close, if not closer, than our relationship be- 
fore the war. The security of both the United 
States and the Philippines, and perhaps the 
future peace of the Pacific will depend very 
much on that relationship. 

The preservation of the present way of life 
of the Filipino people and their Occidental 
culture, which in effect are one and the same 
thing, would serve as a link between the Orient 
and the Occident. We are the product of a 
true and free union between the East and the 
West, and it is our duty to humanity to think 
and act in terms of cooperation between Occi- 
dentals and Orientals.

the recent Herald Tribune Forum in New

Eight-year-old Commonwealth 
Looks to the Future 



Hope and confidence in the future 
of the Philippines was the keynote of 
the nation-wide celebration of the 
eighth anniversary of the Philippine 
Commonwealth. 

President Roosevelt, in a message 
to the people of the Philippines, de- 
clared that "we work and fight for 
the day of your liberation — for the 
day when your Government shall be 
restored to Manila — when you shall 
enjoy the true freedom and independ- 
ence and national dignity which you 
have so fully earned." 

From his sickbed in Washington, 
President Quezon assured the people 
of the Philippines that General Mac- 
Arthur "soon will be able to start 
the reconquest of our homeland," and 
he vowed again that he would return 
to Manila with MacArthur. 

"Our day of redemption is at 
hand," he said, exhorting Filipinos 
to carry on the fight against the in- 
vader, and to keep their faith, be- 
cause "freedom is worth all our trials, 
tears, and bloodshed." 

"I have it on good authority," he 
said further, "that General MacAr- 
thur will soon have the men and ma- 
terial he needs for the reconquest of 
our homeland." 

Vice-President Osmena called upon 
Filipinos everywhere "to continue 
exerting their utmost efforts by the 
side of the United States in this war 
and to remain united in the common 
endeavor to redeem the Philippines." 
He said: "We must hold on, bide our 
time and persevere. The forces of 
evil, while they may linger, cannot 
stay forever." 

Justice Murphy, in a radio address, 
pointed out that this year's anniver- 
sary of the Philippine Commonwealth 
was "the second to be observed by 
the Filipino people under the hostile 
surveillance of a Japanese Army of 
Occupation." He added that "it may 
not be the last" but it was his convic- 
tion that "if on the next fifteenth of 
November the Japanese are still in the 
Philippines, their days in the Islands 



will be of brief number." 

"One day in the not far distant 
future, you will see the American 
fleet — Stars and Stripes afloat — sail- 
ing proudly into Manila Bay," he con- 
tinued. "It will be final assurance 
that the story of the quest for Philip- 
pine independence did not end in the 
blasted tunnels of Corregidor. The 
enemy has written a few tragic pages. 
But, as we prayed and hoped on the 
15th day of November, 1935, the Di- 
vine Author yet will bring the saga 
to a happy ending. And on that day 
there will begin for the people of the 
Philippines a chapter more fair and 
full of promise than any that has yet 
been written." 

Filipino communities throughout 
continental United States and in Ha- 
waii staged programs and banquets. 
The Western Division of the Office 
of the Philippine Resident Commis- 
sioner participated in programs held 
in Salinas, Stockton and San Fran- 
cisco. Filipino communities in Juneau 
and Ketchikan (Alaska), Los Ange- 
les, Seattle, San Diego, Boston and 
New York celebrated the day. 



In New York, Jaime Hernandez, 
Auditor General of the Philippines, 
was principal speaker at a banquet 
given by the Filipino Community un- 
der the auspices of the Filipino Na- 
tionals Council and the Philippine 
Center. He said that "after the clouds 
of war shall have vanished from our 
skies and the liberating forces of de- 
mocracy shall have destroyed the 
forces of oppression in our land, the 
Filipino people as a whole shall 
emerge stronger, more firm and more 
determined to preserve and perpetu- 
ate the democratic way of life in the 
Philippines." 

High officials of the Philippine 
Government attended a special mass 
held at Washington's St. Patrick's 
Catholic Church. The Most Rev. John 
M. McNamara, auxiliary bishop of 
Baltimore and Washington, celebrated 
the mass. The Rev. Francis X. Talbot, 
editor of America, in his sermon, ex- 
pressed the hope that Americans and 
Filipinos could return to the Philip- 
pines by 1946 and pray at the graves 
of "those who died so valiantly in the 
Islands' defense." 




Justice Murphy predicts early return of the American fleet to Manila 
Bay in his Commonwealth Day address as Colonel Romulo, Auditor- 
General Hernandez and Vice President Osmena listen.

FILIPINOS IN THE U. S. ARMED FORCES 



By James G. Wingo 



Neither Japanese conquest of the 
Philippines nor the establishment one 
and one-half years later of the so- 
called Philippine "Republic" has 
ended Filipino armed participation in 
the war against the Axis powers. 

Today uncaptured Filipino soldiers 
fight on in the Philippines under the 
flag of the Philippine Commonwealth, 
the government recognized by the 
United States and the rest of the non- 
Axis world. Tokyo and Manila broad- 
casts constantly remind the outside 
world of continued Filipino resis- 
tance and intransigency. 

The story of the Filipinos still 
fighting in the Philippines can not be 
told now. Perhaps a story of their 
loyalty and gallantry that would do 
them justice will not be told until the 
flag of the government headed by 
President Manuel L. Quezon flies 
again over Malacanan Palace. 

But those in the Philippines are 
not the only Filipinos fighting the 
Axis powers today. Outside of their 



native land thousands of Filipinos 
are serving with various armed serv- 
ices of the United States. Filipinos 
are with the Army, the Air Force, the 
Navy, the Coast Guard and the 
Merchant Marine. 

Filipinos are serving with the 
American expeditionary forces in the 
Mediterranean area, with MacArthur 
in the Southwest Pacific, with Ameri- 
can units in South America, India, 
and other distant places. They are 
aboard warships and other vesesls in 
the Pacific, the Atlantic and the rest 
of the seven seas. 

Before the war, thousands of Fili- 
pinos were already in the United 
States armed forces. The United 
States Army's Philippine Scouts, 
which made a splendid record in the 
Battle of the Philippines, are famed 
throughout the world. For many years 
prior to the war, the United States 
Navy had had hundreds of Filipinos 
aboard all types of warships. Today 
there are more Filipinos than ever in 



the Navy, serving in all capacities. 
Navy officers, on many occasions be- 
fore and after the outbreak of this 
war, have praised the ability, loyalty 
and courage of the Filipino sailors. 

A Filipino sailor went down with 
the first American destroyer sunk by 
the Axis in the Atlantic before Pearl 
Harbor. Since then hardly a Navy 
or Merchant Marine casualty list has 
been made public without the name of 
a Filipino sailor or seaman. 

The spirit of the Filipino sailors 
was described recently by Chief 
Bandmaster Vivencio Yuzon, Chief 
Petty Officer of the United States 
Navy, who has been in the service 23 
years and wears eight campaign bars, 
including the 1917 Nicaraguan Cam- 
paign (with one star) and the Pa- 
cific and Asiatic (with three stars). 
Yuzon and some 150 Filipinos were 
in Java waters aboard a destroyer 
tender when the Japanese attacked 
the Philippines. 

Upon hearing of the attack and of

Filipinos in the United States Army's 
Filipino Infantry, who have been 
training in California since April, 
1942, for the day when they will par- 
ticipate in the recovery of their coun- 
try. These Filipino soldiers entertain 
high hopes of becoming the spear- 
head of the battle to drive the Japa- 
nese out of the Philippines. This 
Army unit, which has been going 
through rigorous lessons in the sci- 
ence of invasion and commando raid- 
ing, is a distinctive unit filled with 
heroic possibilities. 

Before Pearl Harbor the Filipino 
population of continental United 
States and Hawaii contributed its 
proportionate quota to the number 
of prewar trainees. But, immediately 
after the landing of the Japanese in 
the Philippines, thousands of Fili- 
pinos in all parts of the United States 
stormed stations for volunteer serv- 
ice and demanded to be taken into 
the Army or Navy. The Filipino In- 
fantry was the War Department's re- 
sponse to the Filipinos' enthusiasm 
and patriotism. 

Observers of the Filipino Infantry 
soldiers have been struck by their 
high morale and their eagerness to 
fight the invaders of their homeland. 
They have been impressed by the 
unity and discipline of these men, 
who came from all walks of life and 
from the various regions of the 
Philippines. 

Wherever the two Filipino regi- 
ments have been stationed they have 
been commended. When they left Fort 
Ord, the commanding officer of that 
station wrote of them to the Com- 
manding General of the United States 
Army Ground Forces in Washington : 

"These two regiments were recent- 
ly ordered away from here, and all 
of us, both of the post staff and of 
the field forces stationed here, re- 
gretted very much to see these fine 
organizations leave here. We were 
sorry to have to say goodbye to these 
fine regiments. They made a most 
enviable record while at Fort Ord 
and were outstanding in their devo- 
tion to duty and their fine conduct 
both in the garrison and in the sur- 
rounding communities. They regular- 
ly worked exceptionally hard to per- 
fect themselves in their military train- 



ing and they all seemed imbued with 
purpose of qualifying themselves, as 
soon as possible, for duty at the front. 
Their only thought seemed to be to 
get within reach of the Japanese to 
take their full part in freeing their 
beloved Islands. 

"Finally, upon their departure 
from here, they left their barracks, 
their company streets and their entire 
area in such fine condition as to clean- 



liness, sanitation, appearance and 
property accountability, as to call 
forth the highest praise from all the 
staff officers who had occasion to 
check upon these matters. These two 
regiments were again outstanding."

are both Americans and Filipinos.

battalion and now of the first regi-

Japanese atrocities, the Filipinos im- 
mediately wanted to sail to the de- 
fense of their native land. They 
begged their commanding officer for 
a ship — any ship — which they could 
man and sail into Manila Bay to 
fight the Japanese. They told him 
that they could do no less than their 
people at home — die fighting the in- 
vader. 

"Don't be foolish," advised the 
commanding officer. "It can't be 
done." But he was sympathetic; he 
had been in service in Asiatic waters 
for many years and knew how the 
Filipinos felt. 

Frustrated in their desire for action 
in their home waters, the Filipino 
sailors then formed a gun crew of 
their own. These Filipinos, who had 
never handled a gun before, were so 
eager to do their share that they 
broke gunnery drill records set by 
the regular gun crews. 

Carlos Tulao, of Kawit, Cavite, 
shared the glory of the submarine 
crew which sank at least 13 Japanese 
ships in Pacific waters up to last 
March. Tulao, an officers' steward, 
had been hunting enemy cargo ves-

sels and warships since the outbreak 
of the war with Japan. He has been 
in the Navy 13 years. 

In the Coast Guard is a large con- 
tingent of Filipinos. Ranking Fili- 
pino officer is Lt. Commdr. Carmelo 
Lopez Manzano, who recently was on 
a lecture tour in Latin America under 
the auspices of the Coast Guard and 
the Coordinator of Inter-American 
Affairs. He previously was on duty in 
Puerto Rico as executive officer for 
the Chief of Staff of the Coast Guard 
there. 

Commander Manzano was captain 
of the Florence D., a Philippine 
merchant ship converted into a sup- 
ply ship by the United States Navy 
to bring in supplies for the embattled 
Filipino-American forces on Bataan 
and Corregidor. The ship was later 
sunk by Japanese planes near Aus- 
tralia, and Manzano was strafed by 
machine guns necessitating his hos- 
pitalization in Darwin for two 
months. When he reached the United 
States he volunteered for service in 
the Coast Guard. 

An entirely Filipino-manned ship 
is the Coast Guard's Bataan, which 
has been hunting enemy submarines 
in the Caribbean for nearly a year. 
The Bataan, donated by the Philip- 
pine Government to the Coast Guard, 
is under the command of Lt. Juan 
Lacson. 

Filipinos in the Merchant Marine 
have built up a record in this war 
no less heroic than those in the Navy 
and the Army. 

There is the case of the Philip- 
pine ship Dona Nati, commanded by 
Capt. Ramon Pons. He was awarded 
the Distinguished Service Cross by 
Gen. Douglas MacArthur for his 
courageous feat of bringing muni- 
tions and supplies to the beleaguered 
Philippines and taking his ship back 
to Australia, pursued throughout the 
voyage by the Japanese. Capt. Lino 
Conejero, of the Legaspi, received 
the Distinguished Service Cross for 
a similar feat. Capt. Benjamin Ayesa, 
his brother Jose and a Filipino crew, 
went down with their ship, the 
Susana, at the peak of the German 
U-boat campaign in the Atlantic. 

Many Filipinos in the Merchant 
Marine participated in the invasion

of North Africa and Sicily. The 
story of Pedro R. Alcopra is typical. 
He gave up his barber shop in New 
York when the Japanese attacked the 
Philippines and reported to the local 
Maritime Commission office for work 
aboard a merchant ship. He had some 
years before worked as a seaman. 

At first the Maritime Commission 
would not take him in because of his 
poor health, but finally in February, 
1942, he was given a job aboard an 
oil tanker. His ship went as far as 
Iran, and he was in Capetown on the 
homeward trip when he heard that 
President Quezon had reached Wash- 
ington. 

In April, 1943, Alcopra was on 
another oil tanker, which soon joined 
the huge invasion armada in the 
North African campaign. After the 
successful invasion of North Africa, 
his ship served to ferry war material 
in the Mediterranean. Many a time 
Alcopra's ship was subjected to bomb- 
ing but was never hit, although he 
saw some other ships damaged. 

Every time Alcopra returns to New 
York from a sea trip he buys a 
$1,000 war bond. He is anxious to 
return to his native Misamis, Occi- 
dental Misamis. 

The backbone of the Filipino 
contingent in the American armed 
forces is, of course, the thousands of

Quezon Remains President 




THE following joint resolution 
was passed unanimously by the 
United States Senate November 9, 
and passed by a vote of 181 to 107 
by the House of Representatives No 
vember 10. 

"Resolved by the Senate and House 
of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress as- 
sembled. That notwithstanding the 
provisions of section 5 of Article VII 
of the amended Constitution of the 
Philippines, the present President 
and Vice President of the Common- 
wealth of the Philippines serving at 
the time of the introduction of this 
joint resolution shall continue in 
their respective offices until the Presi- 
dent of the United States shall pro- 
claim that constitutional processes 
and normal functions of government 
shall have been restored in the Phil- 
ippine Islands. Thereupon, the ten- 
ure of office of the present President 
of the Commonwealth shall cease and 
the Vice President shall become Pres- 
ident to serve until such time as his 
successor shall have been elected and 
qualified according to the Constitu- 
tion and the laws of the Philippines." 

For some time there has been a 
question as to whether Article VII 
of the Constitution of the Philippines 
was in effect in view of the fact that 
President Quezon, due to enemy occu- 
pation of the Philippines, has been 
deprived of his right to govern and 
exercise jurisdiction over the Philip- 
pine Islands in accordance with the 
provisions of the Tydings-McDuffie 
Act and the Constitution of the Phil- 
ippines. 

Both in the higher councils of the 
Administration and in the Common- 
wealth government it was felt that 
"for the successful prosecution of the 
war from the military viewpoint . . 
it was essential that the necessary 
steps be taken to continue President 
Quezon and Vice President Osmena 
in their respective offices. It was fur- 
ther felt that the matter should b p 
submitted to Congress for such action 
as it may deem proper to take. 



Whereupon Vice President Osmena 
prepared a letter addressed to Sena- 
tor Millard E. Tydings, Chairman of 
the insular affairs committee in the 
Senate, and to Representative C. Jas- 
per Bell, Chairman of the insular 
affairs committe in the House of 
Representatives, which was signed by 
him, the members of the Cabinet, and 
President Quezon. The letter is as 
follows : 

Office of the President of the 
Philippines 

November 5, 1943. 
Senator Millard E. Tydings, 

Chairman, Senate Committee on 
Territories and Insular Affairs. 
Representative Jasper Bell, 

Chairman, House Committee on 
Insular Affairs, 
Washington, D. C. 

Gentlemen : 

We respectfully call to your at- 
tention, and to the attention of the 
Congress of the United States, con- 
ditions affecting the Government of 
the Commonwealth of the Philippines 
upon which you may wish to take 
action. 



Under the provisions of our con- 
stitution, adopted by our people with 
the approval of the United States 
Government, the present incumbent 
of the office of the President will cease 
on November 15, 1943, and on the 
same date the Vice President will 
assume the Presidency. 

Due to the invasion and occupa- 
tion of the Philippines by the Jap- 
anese, constitutional processes and 
normal functions of government have 
been interrupted in the Philippine 
Islands. While this condition pre- 
vails, the question of the Presiden- 
tial succession under our constitu- 
tion comes up for consideration. 

If we were in the Philippines and 
our constitutional government there 
were functioning regularly, there 
would be no problem. But we are 
not in the Philippines; we are in the 
midst of a global war, and our con- 
stitutional system and democratic in- 
stitutions are seriously jeopardized. 
The operation of the legislative and 
judicial branches are suspended by 
enemy occupation and only the ex- 
ecutive branch, which remains free 
from the enemy's action and is now 
temporarily established in Washing- 



• 6 • 



ton, is able to continue performing 
its functions. 

Obviously constitutional govern- 
ment and democratic processes will 
not again function in the Philippines 
until law and order are re-established. 

Therefore, we, the President, the 
Vice President, and the other mem- 
bers of the war cabinet of the Com- 
monwealth of the Philippines, re- 
spectfully submit this matter to the 
President and the Congress of the 
United States with the request that 
they review the whole situation and 
take such action as in their wisdom 
will best serve the interest of the 
Filipino people, their constitutional 
government, and the Government of 
the United States during this emer- 
gency. Congress may feel free to 
consider whether it would be to the 
best interest of both peoples to allow 



changes in the direction of the Com- 
monwealth Government during the 
emergency, to continue the status quo 
until such time as the constitutional 
and democratic processes are fully 
re-established in the Philippines, or 
to follow such other course of action 
as in their opinion is required by 
the circumstances. 

In the event that emergency legis- 
lation is enacted, we are confident 
that it will be made effective only 
for the duration of the war and to 
cover such period of time as is nec- 
essary to re-establish our constitu- 
tional processes in the Philippines, 
when we may proceed again under 
our own constitution. 

We would be most thankful to the 
President and the Congress of the 
United States for whatever attention 
they may give to this matter. 



We have the honor to remain, 
Faithfully yours, 
M. L. Quezon, President; S. Os- 
mena, Vice President; J. M. 
Elizalde, Resident Commis- 
sioner of the Philippines to 
the United States; Basilio J. 
Valdes, Chief of Staff, Sec- 
retary of National Defense; 
Carlos P. Romulo, Secretary 
of Information and Public 
Relations; Andres Soriano, 
Secretary of Finance; J. 
Hernandez, Auditor Gen- 
eral; A. B. Rotor, Secretary 
to the President. 

Upon receipt of this letter, Sena- 
tor Tydings and Congressman Bell 
introduced the resolution, which was 
passed by both houses, and quoted 
at the beginning of this article.

Information and Public Relations 
was created by an executive order by 
President Quezon. Under this order, 
the Office of Special Services was 
abolished, and "the powers, functions 
and duties, as well as the personnel, 
appropriations and properties of the 
Office of Special Services, Office of 
the President of the Philippines," 
were transferred to the new depart- 
ment. 

Col. Carlos P. Romulo was ap- 
pointed Secretary of the Department 
of Information and Public Relations. 
Aide-de-camp to Gen. Douglas Mac- 
Arthur in Bataan, Corregidor and 
Australia, Col. Romulo holds the Sil- 
ver Star for gallantry in action 
(awarded him by General MacArthur 
in Bataan), two Oak Leaf Clusters, 
and the Purple Heart (awarded by 
Lieutenant-General Wainwright in 
Corregidor) . 

Roosevelt on Independence 

President Roosevelt recommend- 
ed "legislation by the Congress 
giving the President the authority, 



after consultation with the President 
of the Commonwealth of the Philip- 
pine Islands, to advance the date pro- 
vided in existing law and to proclaim 
the legal independence of the Philip- 
pines, as a separate and self-govern- 
ing nation, as soon as feasible." 

Tydings on Independence 

Sen. Millard E. Tydings, Chair- 
man of the Committee on Terri- 
tories and Insular Affairs and au- 
thor of a Philippine independence 
joint resolution pending in Congress, 
told a nation-wide radio audience that 
his resolution "will make doubly clear 
to the Filipinos, Japan, and the world 
our honest intentions in the Islands" 
and "will help to destroy the program 
which Japan is trying to work out in 
the Philippines which is to have the 
Filipinos die for Japan and not live 
to enjoy the independence which we 
have given them." 

"We would like to give the Filipi- 
nos their independence immediately, 
but this generous and honest step on 
our part would likely be misinter- 
preted by the Japs," he said. "They 
might say we are cutting the Philip- 
pines adrift. Therefore, it is likely 
that independence will be given to the 
Filipinos when the Japs have been 
driven out and the orderly democratic 
processes of law and order and elec- 
tion which the Filipinos want have 
been restored to them. This, of course, 
should all take place before July 4, 
1946. When it does take place it is 
proposed to give the Filipinos their 
independence then and there." 

U. S. Filipinos Safeguarded 

President Quezon assured all Fili- 
pinos in the United States that he 
will safeguard their interests in con- 
nection with the Philippine independ- 
ence joint resolution pending in Con- 
gress. He said: 

"I desire to assure the Filipinos in 
the United States that as long as I live 
and I am President of the Philippines, 
the interests of the Filipinos in the 



Philippines, in the United States or 
wherever they may be, will be safe- 
guarded by me as far as I can do it. 
I have therefore taken into considera- 
tion the future of the Filipinos resid- 
ing in the United States and have 
deemed it essential in justice to them, 
and in recognition of the loyalty 
shown to America by our Government 
and our people in the Philippines, 
that they be given the right to become 
citizens of the United States. I am 
taking steps to this effect." 

The Philippine "Republic" 

President Quezon, in a message 
broadcast to the Philippines, de- 
clared : 

"We are informed that the so-called 
Philippine Republic sponsored by 
Japan was inaugurated on October 
14, and, on the same day, a Tokyo 
broadcast said: 'The Tokyo Board of 
Information announced the signing 
of a pact of alliance between Japan 
and the Republic of the Philippines.' 
The terms of the alliance as an- 
nounced by Tokyo clearly show the 
real purpose behind the granting by 
Japan of a so-called Philippine inde- 
pendence, namely to use the Philip- 
pines 'politically, economically and 
militarily for the successful prosecu- 
tion of the War of Greater East 
Asia.' " 

Tribute to Filipinos 

President Chiang Kai-shek paid 
a tribute to Filipinos in a mes- 
sage thanking President Quezon for 
his greetings on the anniversary of 
the Republic of China. Said President 
Chiang: 

"In our resistance to Japanese ag- 
gression, we have found an unfailing 
source of encouragement in the fight 
your countrymen are still carrying 
on against the invaders. The sacrifices 
we share together will undoubtedly 
enhance the traditional friendship be- 
tween our two countries and lay an 
unshakable foundation for future co- 
operation, without which peace in the 
Pacific would be but an empty 
dream."

Message to Mexico 

On the 42nd anniversary of the 
Second Pan-American Conference 
convened in Mexico City, President 
Quezon, in a message to the Mexican 
people, said: 

. . . Mexico and the Philippines 
are closer together than ever before, 
for as members of the United Na- 
tions, they are engaged in a struggle 
that welds them together with bonds 
stronger than steel. Victory will be 
theirs for the cause of human free- 
dom is invincible." 

The President's message was read 
by his aide-de-camp, Col. Manuel 
Nieto, before the Club de los Ameri- 
cas in Washington. 

Towering Wall 

"General MacArthur is the one 
man today who stands like a tow- 
ering wall between the Japanese and 
total victory in the southwest Pacific," 
declared President Quezon on the oc- 
casion of the presentation of a bust 
of Gen. Douglas MacArthur to the 
University of Tennessee at Knoxville. 
"He is standing in their way and 
blocking them, exactly as he stood in 
their way and played havoc with their 
timetable in the Philippines. He has 
won spectacular victories, one after 
another, with the limited means at his 
command. But there is only one vic- 
tory that Douglas MacArthur, the 
man of faith, wants to achieve. He 
wants to redeem his pledge made 
upon his arrival in Australia from 
the Philippines more than one year 
ago: 'I broke through and I shall 
return.' 

"For to him Bataan is more than a 
symbol. Bataan is a fact — as large as 
life, as bitter as death. Bataan is a 
grim story of brave men fighting 
against terrible odds, of men who be- 
lieved fiercely in the cause for which 
they were fighting, and in that faith 
were not afraid to die. Bataan is the 
story of men who gave of themselves 
in the fullest possible measure, and 
Douglas MacArthur is not forgetting 
them."

CORPORAL BAYANGAS 



OF THE PHILIPPINE SCOUTS 



THE Battle of the Philippines has 
confirmed the long-time reputation of 
Philippine Scouts' record for daring, 
stoic resistance and devotion to duty. 
So many are the stories told of this 
intrepid band of men that the Phil- 
ippine Scouts have become legendary. 
But the truth is, most of these stories 
are based on actual facts. 

Doctors and nurses who were in 
Bataan and Corregidor remember 
how often the Scouts submitted to 
operations without wincing; how 
they usually refused anesthetics, the 
supply of which was getting lower 
and lower every day, and how they 
asked the doctors to hurry and sew 
them up so they could get back to 
their regiment. 

Clark Lee, war correspondent who 
covered the Battle of the Philippines, 
in his book, tells many stories about 
the hardy Philippine Scouts. He re- 
calls a certain Private Bayani who, 
one day, reported to his superior of- 
ficer that he had met eight Japanese 
in the woods and shot them. 

"How many shots?" asked the of- 
ficer. 

Private Bayani answered, "Why 
eight shots, sir." 

Then, there is the story of Colonel 
Fry, who was directing operations 
against one of the Japanese landings 
on western Bataan. He was walking 
toward the scene of the action when 
a Scouts sergeant in the brush ahead 
called out, "Get down, colonel." 

The Colonel did not hear him and 
walked on. The sergeant, whose leg 



had been shattered a few minutes 
before, jumped from his cover and 
hobbled down the path, calling, "For 
God's sake, colonel, get down." 

Down they went, both of them, 
only a second before a Japanese ma- 
chine gun opened up. 

Colonel Fry put the sergeant on his 
back, crawled out of the fire and 
started to walk back to the rear, car- 
rying the sergeant. He met a Scouts 
corporal limping along with a piece 
of bamboo for a crutch. 

"Are you wounded, Corporal Ro- 
mero?" Colonel Fry asked. 

"No, sir, not wounded," answered 
Romero. 

"What happened?" 

"I saw four Japs, sir, and shot the 
first three, but that fourth Jap came 
close, jumped me, and I fell down 
and twisted my knee, sir. I am not 
wounded, sir." 

These Scouts were lucky to tell 
their tale. Not so lucky was Cpl. 
Pablo Bayangas' fate. Only the bloody 
scene of his last fight could tell his 
story. 

He belonged to the 57th Regiment 
which had received orders to cut off 
a detachment of Japanese which had 
landed on a point in western Bataan. 
The Scouts threw a line across this 
point and pushed forward into the 
woods through the underbrush. 

Corporal Bayangas, advancing 
ahead of the main force, crouched in 
a foxhole behind a large tree cover- 
ing a pathway through the jungle. 
Late in the afternoon he heard a 



rustling in the bushes and saw a large 
group of Japanese crawling through 
the brush a short distance away. 

He aimed his automatic rifle, and 
when the Japanese leader was fifteen 
feet away, he fired. He emptied his 
magazine, killing thirteen Japanese 
with twenty shots. 

But unnoticed by him was a Jap- 
anese officer crawling up from the 
other side of the tree as Bayangas 
was reloading his rifle. The Japanese 
officer fired a pistol bullet into the 
Corporal's head. 

Bayangas' comrades heard the fir- 
ing, ran down the path and killed the 
enemy officer. They found that the 
bullet which had killed the corporal 
had been the last in the Japanese of- 
ficer's pistol.

"Liberator of the Philippines" 

During a recent journey abroad 
I have had occasion to meet some 
very remarkable men from Allied 
countries — national leaders, states- 
men, poets and thinkers, men who 
would rank high not only in their 
own countries, but have an assured 
place in international life. But among 
all of them two men stand out promi- 
nently in my mind, not only by the 
massive ^character of their intellect 
and achievement, but their vigorous 
personalities which have shaped the 
course of national evolution of their 
people, President Manuel Quezon, the 
Liberator of the Philippines, and Dr. 
Hu Shih, the father of Chinese renais- 
sance. In any list of six names of the 
most distinguished Asiatics now liv- 
ing, these two will find an undoubted 
place. 

They have one thing in common. 
Their leadership is not exclusively for 
their countries, nor their appeal solely 
for their people. They are in truth 
leaders of Asia. Though Manuel 
Quezon is the President of the Phil- 
ippine Commonwealth, and Hu Shih 
has only recently retired from the 
difficult task of representing his coun- 
try at Washington, their outlook is 
not circumscribed by narrow geo- 
graphical considerations. Both think 
foundly interested in the political evo- 




Ma

lution of other Asiatic countries. 

This common Asiatic outlook apart, 
there is hardly any common ground 
between the two. Hu Shih, philoso- 
pher, humanist and scholar, justly 
in terms of the future of Asia in a 
world commonwealth. Both are pro- 
known as the Erasmus of China, is 
a politician only by the compelling 
circumstances of his country's life 
and death struggle. President Quezon 
on the other hand is a born fighter, 
a great soldier and general of free- 
dom, one who not merely led the 
movement for Philippine independ- 
ence but achieved that freedom and 
lived to organise it. If Hu Shih is a 
Chinese Erasmus, Quezon is a Philip- 
pine combination of Mazzini and 
Cavour. 

For over two decades Hu Shih has 
been the most outstanding figure in 
the world of Chinese letters and 
thought. The range and depth of his 
thought can be judged from the fact 
that he is not only the leading author- 
ity of Confucian thought but is also 
a profound student of Buddhism and 
European philosophy, and an inter- 
nationally recognized authority on the 
interplay of civilisation. More than 
any other single individual he could 
claim to have moulded the mind of 
modern China. In essence his mes-

'Father of Chinese renaissance' 



sage has been an assertion of the 
true spirit of Confucian China. His 
call to his people has been to shed 
the vain metaphysical speculations 
of Mahayana Buddhism and to go 
back to the secular system of the 
earlier teachers. The interpretation of 
the ancient thought of China in terms 
of modern life has been the object 
of his philosophical work as a teacher 
and prophet of modern China. As 
an active leader of opinion his work 
has been mainly directed towards 
the organisation of society on a 
modern and purposive basis. The 
great obstacle of such a modernisa- 
tion as he visualises has been the 
Indian influence on Chinese life. 
"The Indianisation of China" has, 
according to him, led to results which 
have undermined the humane basis 
of Chinese life, which can be re- 
organised to suit the conditions of the 
modern world only by a re-statement 
of the genuinely national thought of 
China. 

To infer from this that Dr. Hu 
Shih does not appreciate the thought, 
culture and civilisation of India 
would be entirely wrong. What he. 
emphasises, and I think rightly, is 
that the superimposition of an alien 
culture, which in some respects — -

AM a Filipino — inheritor of a glori- 
ous past, hostage to the uncertain 
future. As such I must prove equal 
to a two-fold task — the task of 
meeting my responsibility to the 
past, and the task of performing my obliga- 
tion to the future. 

I am sprung from a hardy race, child many 
generations removed of ancient Malayan 
pioneers. Across the centuries the memory 
comes rushing back to me: of brown-skinned 
men putting out to sea in ships that were as 
frail as their hearts were stout. Over the sea 
I see them come, borne upon the billowing 
wave and the whistling wind, carried upon 
the mighty swell of hope — hope in the free 
abundance of the new land that was to be 
their home and their children's forever. 

This is the land they sought and found. 
Every inch of shore that their eyes first set 
upon, every hill and mountain that beckoned 
to them with a green-and-purple invitation, 
every mile of rolling plain that their view 
encompassed, every river and lake that 
promised a plentiful living and the fruitful- 
ness of commerce, is hallowed spot to me. 

By the strength of their hearts and hands, 
by every right of law, human and divine, 
this land and all the appurtenances thereof — 
the black and fertile soil, the seas and lakes 
and rivers teeming with fish, the forests 
with their inexhaustible wealth in wild life 
and timber, the mountains with their bowels 
swollen with minerals — the whole of this 
rich and happy land has been, for centuries 
without number, the land of my fathers. 
This land I received in trust from them, and 
in trust will pass it on to my children, and 
so on until the world is no more.

mortal seed of heroes — seed that flc

hot blood that sent Lapulapu to

nerved Lakandula in the combat agair 
alien foe, that drove Diego Silang and

of combat from Mactan to Tirad Pass, of 
the voices of my people when they sing:

the sweat of the hard-bitten pioneers in 
Mal-lig and Koronadal, out of the silent en- 
durance of stevedores at the piers and the 
ominous grumbling of peasants in Pam-

born and the lullabies that mothers sing, out 
of the crashing of gears and the whine of 
turbines in the factories, out of the crunch 
of plough-shares upturning the earth, out of 
the limitless patience of teachers in the 
classroom and doctors in the clinics, out of 
the tramp of soldiers marching, I shall make 
the pattern of my pledge:

Cooperative Savings Plan Now in Force 



A HE Cooperative Savings Plan, 
sponsored by Manuel A. Adeva, Na- 
tionals Division Assistant to the Phil- 
ippine Resident Commissioner, and 
approved by President Manuel L. 
Quezon, opens the opportunity to 
every Filipino abroad to help in the 
postwar reconstruction of the Philip- 
pines. It offers every Filipino not in 
uniform a direct way to serve his 
country and the United Nations by 
converting his savings into United 
States War Bonds. It assures him 
capital for the foundation of his eco- 
nomic security in the Philippines af- 
ter the war. 

What is this plan? The Philippine 
Government in Washington will re- 
ceive for safekeeping United States 
War Bonds owned by Filipinos who 
voluntarily agree to deposit these with 
the Philippine Government for the 
duration. After the war is over and 
peace is restored in the Philippines, 
the Philippine Government through 
its proper department, will help the 
depositors organize a corporation in 
the Philippines whose object is to 
develop certain industries or engage 
in agriculture. 

What is the main object of the 
plan? It is to give every Filipino in 
the United States and Hawaii an 
opportunity to share in the building 
of the Philippine Republic through 
the use of his savings. 

Who may participate in the plan? 
All Filipinos. 

Can the depositor send money for 
deposit? The Philippine Government 
will accept for deposit United States 
War Bonds only. 

To whom will the War Bonds be 
sent for deposit? Participants in the 
plan should send their War Bonds to 
the Philippine National Bank, 25 
Broadway, New York, New York, ac- 
companied by a form letter which 
may be obtained from the Office of 
the Philippine Resident Commission- 
er, 1617 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W. 
Washington 6, D. C; the Western 
Division, Office of the Philippine Res- 
ident Commissioner, Suite 1108- 
1110, 405 Montgomery Street, San 
Francisco, California; The Philippine 
Center, 131 West 72nd Street, New 



York City; or the presidents of Fili- 
pino comunities or Filipino Nationals 
Councils. 

Can a Filipino send his War Bonds 
to the Philippine National Bank in 
New York for deposit for the duration 
without participating in the plan? 
Yes. 

Can the depositor withdraw any or 
all of his War Bonds before the end 
of the war? Under this plan, the de- 
positor may not cash his bonds before 
the war is over, except in extreme 
cases of emergency, such as sickness 
or death in the family, in which case 
he will be permitted to cash as many 
of his War Bonds as are sufficient to 
defray such expenses. 

What will happen to the War Bonds 
should the depositor die before the 
end of the war? His bonds will be 
held in the name of his beneficiary. 

What will the Philippine Govern- 
ment do with the deposits after the 
end of the war? The Philippine Gov- 
ernment will help the depositors or- 
ganize a corporation to engage in 
business or agriculture in the Phil- 
ippines. Each depositor will be en- 
titled to shares of stock in the cor- 
poration corresponding to the total 
value of his United States War Bonds 
deposits. That will be his investment 
in the reconstruction of the Philip- 
pines. 

Who will determine the nature of 
business which the proposed corpora- 
tion will engage in? It will be deter- 
mined by the depositors themselves. 
The Philippine Government, through 
its proper department, will, of course, 
lend its assistance in the selection of 
an enterprise in which Filipino capi- 
tal can be most profitably employed. 

Will the Philippine Government 
participate financially in this enter- 
prise? The Philippine Government 
will make no financial investments in 
the corporation. It will, however, 
guide the depositors in the organiza- 
tion of the corporation and extend to 
them all the governmental facilities 
toward that purpose. Once it is or- 
ganized, the Philippine Government 



will leave the whole administration 
and supervision of the corporation to 
its duly-elected officers. 

Who will bear the expense in carry- 
ing out this plan? The Philippine 
Government will bear all expenses in- 
curred in carrying out this plan. Not 
one cent of the depositors' money will 
be used to defray expenses in receiv- 
ing and keeping the War Bonds for 
deposit. 

When can one begin sending War 
Bonds for deposit in connection with 
the plan? Any Filipino interested in 
the plan may send his War Bonds for 
deposit to the Philippine National 
Bank in New York City now. 

Are receipts issued for deposits 
made? Every deposit will be acknowl- 
edged by the Manager of the Philip- 
pine National Bank. 

The Philippine Government aims, 
through this plan, to enable Filipinos 
to invest their savings in the Philip- 
pine Republic. After the war, great 
opportunities for agricultural and in- 
dustrial development will be open to 
all, and Filipinos abroad should pre- 
pare themselves now to be able tb 
help materially in the rebuilding of 
their country. 



Map-Maker 

Collecting maps is Percy 
Warner Tinan's hobby. Mr. 
Tinan, a long-time Philippine 
resident, has an assortment of 
Philippine road maps which 
are probably the best available 
in the United States. He also 
has a good collection of Philip- 
pine photographs, including a 
very good one of Santo Tomas 
University. 

The Tinan letterhead stresses 
that his Cleveland, Ohio, ad- 
dress is not permanent. It reads :

'Rising Sun' Is Being Rammed 
Back Into the Savage Depths 
from Which It Sneaked."

Two Leaders of Asia 

(Continued from page 11) 



e. g., the establishment of numerous 
monasteries with a large priesthood 
living on alms — was unsuitable to 
China, did not in fact lead to a proper 
synthesis of thought, but to an unfor- 
tunate devaluation of what was truly 
great in the national life and civili- 
sation of China. 

Among the numerous achievements 
of Dr. Hu Shih there is one which 
always interested me as of special 
importance to India. That is his fa- 
mous declaration of Literary Inde- 
pendence. Till quite recently Chinese 
language and literature were domi- 
nated by the stilted classical style of 
the mandarins, weighted heavily by 
numerous quotations from classics 
and allusions to earlier poets, meant 
more to convey the scholarship of 
the writer than as a living medium 
of expression. At one stroke Hu Shih 
changed this. His clarion call to re- 
place this scholastic language by the 
simple and direct expression of the 
common folk had immediate effect. 
By this single act of courage and vi- 
sion he created a powerful instrument 
of national unification. 

When I arrived in New York last 
December, Hu Shih had just retired 
from his post as Chinese Ambassador 
in America and was living the quiet 
life of a scholar. I took an early 
opportunity of getting in touch with 
him. In discussions with him I dis- 
covered that the range of his mind 



was something exceptional. His one 
question to me to which he reverted 
time after time was "why is it that 
India did not receive anything of 
value from China? It seems to have 
been at all times a one-way traffic." 
Though China is India's neighbour 
and received liberally from her, 
neither printing nor paper, nor any 
of the other great inventions of China 
penetrated into India. Even Chinese 
silk reached the Indian market 
through indirect routes. Neither por- 
celain nor Chinese art found any 
appreciation in India. More than all 
this, while scholars through the length 
and breadth of China were studying 
the sacred books brought from India, 
writings of the Chinese sages do not 
seem to have penetrated even to Uni- 
versity circles. Why was it all a one- 
way traffic? Surely India would have 
gained greatly if the material civili- 
sation of China, not to speak of her 
great contribution to thought had 
come to India by a fairer interchange. 
To this question I had no reply. The 
wide currency that Indian stories has 
obtained in China was a subject of 
great interest to him. In his learned 
introduction to Arthur Waley's trans- 
lation of the Chinese novel entitled 
"The Monkey," Hu Shih draws atten- 
tion to the influence of Hanuman 
mythology in the medieval stories 
of China. 

Our discussions were by no means 
confined to the byways of scholar- 
ship. Dr. Hu Shih is profoundly in- 
terested in the new developments in 
Hindu social life and generally in 
the political problem of India. Es- 
sentially the Indian question, as he 
frankly stated, is one of organising 
the people of India into one pur- 
posive community ridding it of the 
accretion of ages by way of social 
customs and usages. 

The future of Asia he visualises 
as a great commonwealth based on 
the cooperation of Asiatic peoples, 
especially China, India and in course 
of time a non-militarist and peaceful 
Japan. He is optimistic enough to 
look forward to a period of coop- 
eration between the three great 



peoples for the welfare of Asia and 
the millions it holds. 

President Quezon's approach to 
the question is different. It can best 
be understood in terms of his own 
unique achievements. 

Manuel Quezon is undoubtedly one 
of the greatest political figures of 
Asia. For over a quarter of a cen- 
tury he has been the accredited leader 
of his people, fighting their battles, 
leading them through troubles and 
tribulations and finally negotiating 
the treaty which established the Phil- 
ippine Commonwealth. He is now its 
first elected President. Few national 
leaders of our time have had such 
a political career of outstanding suc- 
cess. Starting as a political agitator 
in a subject country, in twenty years 
he became the President of a free 
republic in alliance with the United 
States. 

Manuel Quezon's career as a na- 
tional leader began in 1917. The 
date is a significant one in the his- 
tory of Oriental nationalism. It was 
in the same year that the personality 
of Ghandhiji was coming to the fore- 
front in India. It was at the same 
time that Zaghlul was being acclaimed 
as the national leader in Egypt. 

In 1917 the Filipinos were going 
through a regime of repression under 
General Wood. The policy of coop- 
eration which Osmena had advocated 
and which had achieved a measure 
of success under the liberal regime of 
Governor-General Harrison no longer 
received the support of the younger 
generation. Osmena's leadership was 
challenged by the young Filipino 
party which found a leader in Manuel 
Quezon. From 1917 he has been the 
unquestioned head of the nationalist 
movement of his country. 

Short, stocky, with handsome 
Malay features, Senor Quezon is an 
Oriental, proud of his race and his 
people. He is also a product of the 
West, a happy combination of Span- 
ish and American culture, with the 
outlook of one belonging to a world 
civilisation, a prototype of what a 
true and free union between the East

Spurious Patriotism 

"The phony patriotism 
whipped up by cheap movies 
makes me sick through and 
through," writes Laura Lee, 
columnist in the Philadelphia 
Bulletin. "The patriotism of 
'Salute to the Marines' is not 
only blatantly spurious, but the 
treatment of Filipinos as a 
bunch of unruly kids must be 
insulting to them. I can not be- 
lieve that those who suffered 
the anguish of war in the Phil- 
ippines consider this a tribute 
to what they did there."

PICTURES of the Filipino Infantry 
showing soldiers practising the use of 
the bolo, their forefathers' main weap- 
on, may appear to many people who 
are familiar with giant tanks and 
huge flying fortresses a mere publici- 
ty stunt. The fact is that even in this 
age of highly-mechanized warfare the 
bolo is still regarded by the trainers 
of the Filipino Infantry in California 
as a deadly weapon, with an impor- 
tant place, at least in the projected 
recovery of the Philippines. 

In addition to the United States 
Army soldier's standard equipment, 
the men in the Filipino Infantry have 
been issued the bolo and ordered to 
learn how to use it. Of course, there 
is little, if any, the average Filipino 
soldier has to learn in the use of the 
bolo. In the Far East, a general be- 



lief persists that every American is 
born with a silver spoon in his mouth. 
It is more accurate to say that every 
Filipino is born with a bolo in his 
hand. 

Shortly before the outbreak of the 
war a Filipino writer wrote of the 
historical role of the sharp-bladed 
instrument as a weapon and tool in 
the Philippines. Said he : 

Symbol of Filipino life is the bolo. 
Look at its sturdy blade as it glistens 
in the sun and pierces the darkest 
forests. Listen to its whizzing sound 
as it clears away the gloomiest thick- 
ets and opens a virgin valley to the 
sky. Here upon this plain the ancient 
Filipino, the first of a noble race, 
built himself a home. 

Lonely heart in the loneliest woods, 
he had carved a path through the un- 



charted wilderness, cut down the tall- 
est trees, smoothed the prickly vines 
into the toughest thongs and beat 
the palm leaves into a thatched roof. 
Fearless and alone he labored with 
his singing blade by day and slept 
beside it when the shadows fell. With 
his trusty bolo he dug and delved 
and planted. He scooped the earth 
to make the ditches and stroked the 
ooze into ridges that shortly hard- 
ened and stretched like arms around 
his green valley. 

He wandered through the wilds, 
himself undaunted and untamed, 
ripping with his keen blade the rind 
of fruits and the bark of trees hoping 
to find in the heart of the woods the 
means to warm his body and to keep 
the blood tingling through his 
bronzed sinews. With it too he slashed 
the heart of every lowly beast that 
crossed his path that he might drink 
of its wild blood, carve its yielding 
flesh, and slice its meat into hide-like 
pieces to keep against the rainiest of 
days. 

The bolo, too, has been the tool of 
the Filipino artist. With it the brown 
man of the first towns whittled the 
green bamboo into a flowering arch, 
made the first flute, shaped the pith 
of the hardest woods into tables, and 
fashioned the first wooden-shoes that 
he might give to his love. Rudely, 
with the point of his bolo, he wrote 
the first love-song on the trunks of 
trees, and out of the green forest he 
formed carven images of his gods. 
With his bolo he made the torches 
and the lanterns too and when the 
poor folk gathered for the harvest- 
feast they saw the lanterns blossom 
into many-colored flowers of flicker- 
ing light. 

The bolo is a symbol of liberty. 
Woe upon the enemy that seeks to 



• 16 • 



:rush with an iron heel the Filipino! 
Cold and relentless, it has been un- 
sheathed and brandished by even the 
lowliest peasant in defense of his 
home and country. Armed with the 
bolo alone Lapu-Lapu led his em- 
battled tillers of the soil against Ma- 
gellan and his well-armed horde. And 
there upon the peaceful shores of the 
island of Mactan the bolo became a 
song of unyielding steel. There, too, 
it wrote in characters of blood, that 
Filipinos may read for all time, the 
piercing cry, "This is our native 
land." 

After long, gloomy years of slav- 
ery, out of the all-embracing clangor 
of dragging chains, and out of the 
night of groans and sighs, the rally- 
ing cry of the bolo came again. On a 
lonely hill at Balintawak a silent man, 
a low plebeian raised it to the skies 
that an enslaved people might see its 
angry gleam by the light of flaming 
torches. We broke our chains with 
that bolo. We slashed our way from 
the heavy shadows of our prison cell 
to bare our breasts to our life-giving 
sun. We smashed the walls of our 
dungeon that we might breathe again 
the cool, clean air of our hills and 
valleys. With that bolo we rent the 
black cloud that had fallen like a 
pall on our land, and emerged a 
happy smiling people. 

Thus the bolo— crude, lowly, un- 
pretentious, — is not only a tool for 



the arts of peace but also a weapon 
for the preservation of our liberty as 
a people and of our rights as free 
men. If once again, it becomes our 
fate to call the peaceful farmer from 
his valley and the lonely fisherman 
from his nets to march and fight once 
more for home and family, the Fili- 
pino will not fail. The bolo will be 
unsheathed. It will be a song of un- 
yielding steel. It shall not be sheathed 
again until the enemy is laid low and 
the Filipino is returned to his happy 
valley — a q U iet tiller of the soil, a 
free man among the free. 

In December, 1941, "the peaceful 
farmer from his valley and the lone- 
ly fisherman from his nets had to 
march and fight once more for home 
and family." And long after the fall 
of Bataan and Corregidor, it became 
increasingly evident that the bolo re- 
mained unsheathed and was being 
used against the Japanese invader. 
Another Filipino, writing after the 
Battle of the Philippines, said: 

Evidence that this sharp-bladed 
implement of the Filipino worker in 
the fields is being used to chop off 
Japanese heads is the invaders' order 
to inhabitants of areas under their 
control to surrender all arms, includ- 
ing unauthorized bolos. 

The Filipino worker knows how to 
wield his bolo. In the darkness of 
night or in jungle ambushes many a 



Japanese falls and does not live to 
tell what hit him, for the expert bolo- 
man usually needs only one blow to 
eliminate his adversary. 

Nothing should demoralize the 
Japanese, no mean guerrila fighters 
themselves, more effectively than 
finding early in the morning the 
hacked bodies of their sentries and 
patrolmen in town streets or the de- 
capitated bodies of their comrades on 
mountain trails or in thick bushes 
at barrio outskirts. That these are 
frequent happenings is indicated by 
constant warnings made by the Japa- 
nese authorities to the Filipinos to 
co-operate more effectively with the 
conquerors' new order or else. 

The Filipino Infantry is a distinc- 
tive unit, composed of men from the 
Philippines who, in almost every case, 
have a particular score to settle with 
the Japanese. When the day comes 
for these Filipino soldiers to march 
back with Douglas MacArthur to the 
Philippines, their bolos doubtless will 
come in handy. 

The bolo is not expected to play 
a decisive role in this war, but the 
sight of it in the hands of the re- 
deemers of the Philippines, glisten- 
ing in the tropical sun, will recall to 
all Filipinos the symbol of their na- 
tional resistance against tyranny — 
the monument of a man brandishing 
a bolo, the "Cry of Balintawak".

BROTHERS UNDER THE SKIN. By Carey 
McWilliams. Little Brown and 
Company, Boston, 19 US. 325 pp. 
$3.00. 



Wi 



HEN Carey McWilliams wrote 
Factories in the Field he was at once 
branded as a radical. That book was 
an eye-opener because it showed that 
the farming and agricultural pioneer- 
ing of California was due mainly to 
the Japanese, Chinese, Mexicans and 
Filipinos. 

McWilliams took the epithet in 
his stride and went on with his crusade 
for justice and right and enlighten- 
ment. Subsequently, he wrote another 
eye-opener, Brothers Under the Skin. 
The book makes very interesting read- 
ing in spite of its technical treatment 
of the subject matter. It is especially 
recommended, for this reason, to stu- 
dents of sociology and to those inter- 
ested in the post-war reconstruction of 
the world. 

Brothers Under the Skin contains a 
lengthy introduction, which is a re- 
sume of the book itself. The author 
says : 

"As a nation of nations we alone 
are in a position to exercise real 
political leadership. At the same 
time, however, the divisive forces 

that have brought disaster to the 

world also threaten our national 
unity." 

The author continues and says, in 
words that contain a dire warning to 
this country, "Our unique position 
constitutes both our strength and our 
weakness. If we fail in the world, we 
fail at home; if we fail at home, we 
are not likely to succeed in the world." 

How the United States has been 
failing at home so far because of its 
treatment of the racial minorities is 
the text of McWilliams' book. 

According to McWilliams, the Chi- 
nese have been the butt of the worst 
form of racial discrimination. Also dis- 
criminated against were the Mexicans, 
the Negros, the Japanese, the Puerto 
Ricans, and the Hawaiians. It is the 
same story, with slight variations. 

On Filipino immigration to the Uni- 
ted States the author maintains that 
"there is scarcely a Filipino in Hawaii 
or the mainland, who did not leave the 
Islands as a result of direct or in- 
direct invitation to do so." McWilliams 
places the responsibility for 100,000 
Filipinos in America and Hawaii on 
the United States. 

Several pages are devoted to an in- 
teresting account of Filipino habits, 
social customs, professions, employ- 
ment, recreational practices, peculari- 



ties and idiosyncracies of Filipinos as 
a people and as individuals. The gen- 
eral treatment of the subject matter, 
although quite factual, is endowed 
with such a refreshing touch of can- 
dor and sincerity that it never offends. 
A clinician's approach to both an eth- 
nic and social set-up, it offers a real- 
istic view of one more section of Amer- 
ica's mosaic of racial minorities, with 
its attendant acute problems seeking 
for solution. 

The Filipino problem in this coun- 
try was bad enough before the war, 
but the situation since the outbreak 
of the war "has become even more 
complicated and embarrassing," says 
the author. The complication arose 
out of a number of special exemptions 
for Filipinos in apparent violation of 
existing laws. The embarrassment lay 
in the fact that conditions on the 
home front were contrary to the 
United States' international avowal of 
race equality. 

After a thorough study and dis- 
cussion of his subject, McWilliams de- 
votes the last pages of his book to 
formulating a program of legislative 
reform by the national government. 
In his opinion, "our first assignment 
... is to establish the principle that, 
as a matter of national policy, there 
shall be no discrimination against in- 
dividuals because of race, color, creed, 
or country of national origin." 

He realizes of course the tremen- 
dous magnitude of the problem. It is 
something which has been in existence 
for centuries and its roots go deep 
down into the social and legal frame- 
work of the nation. It may be found 
in social taboos and statutory enact- 
ments. It is so entrenched in the South 
that it nullifies the Constitution itself. 
McWilliams thinks that this is the 
time to do something about it. 

To ignore the racial question is to 
ignore the greatest potential for in- 
ternational mischief, which, in the 
opinion of authoritative sources would 
be the seeds of the Third World War. 
As McWilliams aptly puts it: "We 
cannot retreat to the pre-war relation- 
ship of races and cultures even if we 
desired to do so." — Manuel I. Abella

LEADING this book and knowing 
Mr. Lattimore make me reflect on the 
meaning of high thoughts. High ac- 
tions should go with high thoughts. 
High courage, spiritual and intellec- 
tual, is needed for high actions. The 
hope of freedom and a good peace for 
millions of human beings who have 
been denied a free and a good life can 
come true when we have men who 
think highly and act loftily with cour- 
age. That hope is darkened when cour- 
age fails and the failure besmears hu- 
man dignity. 

In Mr. Lattimore's ideas one finds 
fearless and high thinking. This is the 
quality of his concept of democracy — 
in one respect. Democracy as a faith, 
a moral and philosophical order, which 
could justify us in claiming that we 
are fighting for a world of elementary 
human freedom, that we are putting 
an end to political and economic 
exploitation and to the "only one real 
color peril — the White Peril which has 
been the most searing and brutal and 
pitiless factor in the lives of millions 
and millions of humanity." 

But such a faith, such an order, is 
first of all a system of basic human 
values. It is also called a democratic 
system. In time, as we see today, it 
turns into a challenge to that other 
concept of democracy, not as a human 

faith, but as a political and economic 

system which is the product of his- 
torical conditions. Mr. Lattimore chal- 
lenges the vices of this historical sys- 
tem. He condemns its imperialism, 
both political and economic. He ex- 
poses its obsessions of power and 
race. 

All Mr. Lattimore's vigor in his 
condemnation of the vices of the sys- 
tem grows out of the underlying faith. 
But all Mr. Lattimore's courage stops 
with the system and evaporates before 
the novel breadth and depth of that 
faith. 

This is what happens when Mr. Lat- 
timore cannot say that to those coun- 
tries Japan has conquered, which were 
formerly Western colonies, our return 
must bring liberation. Instead he puts 
the Philippines and Korea apart, for 
as he says of Korea: "We know that 
Korea, despite its long subjection, is 
not a country that is going to be re- 
conquered from Japan. We know that 
it is going to be liberated from Japan." 
But of the other countries, he believes 
not so much in their liberation as in 
their reconquest from Japan. And yet 
Mr. Lattimore says in the same 
breath that Americans are fools if 
they shut out half the world from the

world of elementary human freedom 
they are fighting for. 

From the complexities of the Pacific, 
Mr. Lattimore escapes to the promise 
of a flowering, but an unborn, society 
in China's deep western hinterland — 
the vast land frontier between China 
and Russia, from the Pacific to the 
Pamirs. But beyond China's western 
hinterland one cannot escape the neg- 
ative test of the democratic system 
that India poses, nor the new chal- 
lenge of Russia to that system. To 
the test and to the challenge no vital 
response is given by Mr. Lattimore's 
wan hope in the good behavior of 
conservatives and liberals in the fu- 
ture, or in his skepticism and fear of 
the cause of revolutionaries. 

The appeal of Mr. Lattimore's high- 
mindedness about Asiatic peoples, 
about democracy, and about the race 
problem in today's war and in tomor- 
row's peace is not quite destroyed by 
the limitations of his traditional hopes 
and fears. There remains the final 
test of action to which such high-mind- 
edness must be subjected, and he who 
has used that test can tell what the 
value of high thoughts that fail of 
noble action is. The value is nil.

ment is Col. R. H. Offley, who learned 
to speak Tagalog and some other 
Philippine languages as a boy in 
Mindoro, where his father was mili- 
tary governor. 

Many of the Filipino oflicers are 
West Pointers. A battalion command- 
er, Lt. Col. Jaime Velasquez, a gradu- 
ate of the United States Military 
Academy, accompanied President 
Manuel L. Quezon of the Philippines 
from Corregidor to America. 

Some of the Filipino officers had 
never worn a military uniform be- 
fore the outbreak of the Pacific war. 
Capt. Fred C. Guerrero previously 
was one of J. Edgar Hoover's G-men. 

Many of the other Filipino officers 
are doctors of medicine. Five of these 
left the Philippines as volunteers on 
the Mactan, the interisland Philip- 
pine steamer which carried 224 
American and Filipino wounded sol- 
diers from Manila at the peak of the 
bombing of the Philippine capital to 
Australia.

Miss Zenaida Quezon, and Lt. An-

Teacher's Message 

Miss Bertha D. Charles, teacher 
in the Philippines for 35 years, urged 
her Filipino friends to continue to 
maintain faith in America. Her mes- 
sage, broadcast to the Philippines, ac- 
cording to the Philippine Department 
of Information and Public Relations : 

"Our voice may sound too far 
away from you now. You may even 
come to think that with the presence 
of the enemy at your door we shall 
not be able to go ahead with what we 
started to accomplish. But the desire 
to live in a truly free atmosphere 
knows not the limits of time or dis- 
tance. Japan will not be able to de- 
stroy the things we have built to- 
gether, the numerous long bridges of 
good will we were able to span across 
many a troubled water. The enemy 
cannot so soon obliterate in your 
minds the memory of classrooms and 
free thought." 



Speaking of the Mactan, the 
wounded Filipinos evacuated to Aus- 
tralia have long since been back to 
active duty under General MacArthur. 
Thirty-one of them have reached the 
United States. Some of these, like 
Sgt. Crisanto Bautista, is back on ac- 
tive duty with the medical unit in 
Fort Meade, Maryland, as a postal 
clerk. This former Philippine Army 
soldier lost his left leg below the knee 
while fighting the Japanese near 
Lingayen.

and the West can produce. A fervent 
patriot, he thinks in terms of Asia 
and of Asiatic cooperation with the 
West. 

His personal magnetism is some- 
thing which evokes unquestioned loy- 
alty. You had to be only a few min- 
utes with him to realise that you 
were in the presence of a really 
great man, one who will have a 
great part to play in shaping the 
future of the new world. In his con- 
versations with me I found that his 
understanding of the Indian problem 
was clear and he stated his views 
without hesitation. "We have had the 
same problems, the same attitudes 
to face and therefore I am in a posi- 
tion to understand your difficulties," 
he declared. As the head of a state 
he could not give public expression 
to his views, but President Quezon 
as a nationalist and leader of his 
people is following the events in 
India with the greatest interest and 
the fullest understanding. 

It is my firm belief that the Fili- 
pinos, an Oriental people with a 
European and Christian civilisation, 
with their race rooted deeply in the 
East and their culture rooted by 300 
years of contact with the West has 
a great part to play in the Asia of 
the future. To the modernisation of 
Asia it has a great contribution to 
make. Under the leadership of Presi- 
dent Quezon it will play a most nota- 
ble role in the remaking of a new 
Asia. 



Bernardo de la Torre, another Mactan 
evacue, is working at a munitions 
plant in New Jersey. 

In the Air Force are also Filipino 
officers. One of them is Lt. Roberto 
Lim, a recent West Point graduate 
and son of Brig. Gen. Vicente Lim, 
of the Philippine Army, who fought 
on Bataan and was the first Filipino 
to graduate from the United States 
Military Academy. Another is Maj.

Escape from the 
Japanese 

ElPIDIO P. CLAVECILLA, chief 
was one of the sea-faring Filipinos 
officer of a Philippine merchant ship, 
in enemy-occupied territory when the 
Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. He 
recently arrived in Washington after 
a series of ruses and escapes involv- 
ing not only him but 15 other Fili- 
pinos. 

The 35-year-old Filipino who out- 
witted the Japanese was anxious to 
meet the Japanese again. From Wash- 
ington he went to New Orleans for 
assignment to an American ship by 
the recruiting and manning organiza- 
tion of the war shipping administra- 
tion. 

Of his escape from the Japanese, 
Clavecilla told this story: 

"My ship, the 5.S. Churruca, was 
tied up in the Hongkong harbor 
when the Japanese attacked. When it 
became evident that Hongkong could 
not withstand the enemy onslaught, 
we scuttled the ship on order from 
the British. 

"For a time after the fall of the 
city we — the Filipinos aboard my 
ship — were held prisoners by the 
Japanese in one of the Hongkong 
hotels. Then we were released in the 
city because, the Japanese said, 'you 
are Orientals.' They wished to gain 
our support, but also they didn't have 
enough food to feed us. 

"Macao, a neighboring island, was 
owned by the Portuguese, but it was 
well known that it was controlled by 
the Japanese secret police. I asked 
permission to go to Macao to see if 
I could obtain money from the own- 
er of my ship, who was in that colony. 
Three of my men had died of berberi 
and I had to have money to live in 
Hongkong, I told the Japanese. 

,"They finally allowed me to go on 
the promise that I return to Hong- 
kong with the money. At Macao I 
went to the British consul who sent 
me to Rev. Lowell B. Davis, an Amer- 
ican missionary, who was chairman 
of a relief committee there. Rev- 
erend Davis and I worked out a 
plan to get my men out of Hong- 
kong, 



"We decided to stage several box- 
ing matches, sponsored by the Portu- 
guese police force, and invite my 
countrymen in Hongkong, with Jap- 
anese permission, of course, to come 
and fight the Portuguese boys. I 
posed as a professional boxer, but I 
had had some pugilistic experience. 
In 1930 I was contender for the title 
of Philippine featherweight cham- 
pion. 

"After the matches Reverend 
Davis sent us out to his farm, four 
miles from Macao, ostensibly to work 
for him. I alone, of the Filipinos, 
knew that he had planned for the 
escape of 15 Filipinos and 22 Amer- 
icans, Britishers, Russians, and Chi- 
nese. 

"One night we fled. I can't say who 
helped us, for they may be helping 
others now. But we fled by boat. We 
had to pass a Japanese-fortified is- 
land during the night. We were spot- 
ted and fired on but no one was hit. 

"Our group landed on free China 
and practically walked to the Chi- 
nese city of Samfou. From there I 
found my way to the United States." 

Encounter 
With a "Sub" 

STEWARD Pedro Vergara, of the 
United States Coast Guard, who holds 
an A.M. degree from the University 
of California, was majoring in po- 
litical science at Columbia University 
in New York when he enlisted for 
armed service in October, 1942. Since 
then he has had more than six 
months service aboard a patrol ship 
guarding the Caribbean from the as- 
saults of enemy submarines. 

He recently visited the Philip- 
pines' editorial offices and gave this 
graphic account of one encounter 
with the enemy: 

"It was a beautiful April after- 
noon. The 125-foot cutter to which I 
was attached was cruising at normal 
speed. The crew had just been secured 
from 'general quarters' drill. Sud- 
denly the gong sounded with a shrill 
note. There was a general feeling 
among the men that this was not just 
a practice drill. We lost no time going 
to our battle stations. Word was 
passed around that our 'sound gear* 



picked up an echo of a submarine. 

"The source of the echo was plotted 
and the ship was steered toward it. 
Soon our soundman reported the 
source of the sound at so many yards 
ahead. Then the projectiles from our 
anti-submarine projectors were set 
off flying into the air by an electric 
charge. The charge was started by 
pushing an electric button in the 
bridge. The projectiles came down in 
an arc into the sea. Within a fraction 
of a second after hitting the surface 
of the water, a tremendous explosion 
was heard. These projectiles were de- 
signed to explode only upon contact 
with a hard surface. Inasmuch as 
there were no reefs in that area, it 
was assumed that we hit an undersea 
craft. But there was no way of tell- 
ing that it was disabled or completely 
destroyed. 

"The following dav a destroyer 
picked up a disabled submarine in the 
vicinity of our encounter. There is no 
doubt that this was the submarine 
which suffered from the telling depth 
charges from our ship."

Another indication of the fact that, 
despite Japanese occupation of their 
country, Filipinos are still fighting a 
second global war, is the recent an- 
nouncement that Tech. Sgt. Simon E. 
Alojado of the Air Corps was missing 
in the European theater of operations. 
Probably not until the war is over 
will the full extent of Filipino sacri- 
fice and effort in the war against the 
Axis powers be known. 

Many Filipino priests and preach- 
ers are also with American armed 
forces. A Filipino Protestant chap- 
lain, Jose Castillo, a graduate of Bos- 
ton University, was very popular at 
his previous post at Fort Monmouth. 
Of him one American soldier wrote 
to his mother: "He talks a language 
we understand." 

The Philippine Government in 
Washington is very proud of the Fil- 
ipinos in the armed forces of the 
United States and has given its ut- 
most cooperation to the United States 
Government in getting Filipinos in 
this country to be of the greatest serv- 
ice in the common cause.

VI LL AMOR, Filipino Ace, in Washington 




Major Villamor is greeted by Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt, as Mrs. Manuel 
L. Quezon (center) looks on, at the party given to Filipino servicemen by 
the Filipino Women's Club in Washington. 



MAJ. JESUS VILLAMOR, No. 1 Fil- 
ipino ace, who has just arrived from 
Australia, states that the Filipinos' 
"faith in America, in President Roose- 
velt, in President Quezon and in Gen- 
eral MacArthur stands unshaken" and 
that his people's loyalty to America 
and Quezon's government are mani- 
fested in "forms other than words," 
such as extending "support and co- 
operation" to guerrillas. 

Major Villamor, who was ordered 
out of the Philippines by General Mac- 
Arthur in April, 1942, is in a position 
to report on existing conditions in his 
country. 

"I have seen our people weary, sick 
and battered, pick themselves up from 
the dusty ruins of defeat and lift high 
their torch of liberty in our country," 
says Major Villamor. "I have seen how 
our people, despite sickness, hunger 
and all those things which only the 
oppressed can suffer, remain steadfast- 
ly loyal to America and to our own 
exiled government. Their loyalty has 
manifested itself in forms other than 
words. They have toiled and sacrificed 
for the guerrillas. I am sure that with- 
out their efforts and the support and 
cooperation they have given to the guer- 
rillas, there would not be any guer- 
rillas. The things that the people have 
done, the sacrifices they have endured 
and the contributions they have made 
undoubtedly will go down in Philip- 
pine history as one of the most com- 
pelling chapters in the story of Fili- 
pino participation in this war. 

"Their faith in America, in Presi- 
dent Roosevelt, in President Quezon, 
and in General MacArthur stands un- 
shaken. They know that America is 
solid behind President Roosevelt's 
pledge to redeem the Philippines. And 
they know, that some day, very soon 
they pray, General MacArthur will once 
again step on Philippine soil to free 
their country forever from under the 
heels of the war lords of Japan." 

Major Villamor was captain in the 
Philippine Army Air Corps when the 
Japanese attacked the Philippines. On 
December 10, 1941, in the face of 
heavy enemy fire from strong enemy air 
forces, he led his flight of three pur- 
suit planes into action. "By his con- 
spicuous example of courage and lead- 
ership, and at a great personal hazard 
beyond the call of duty, his flight was 
enabled to rout the attacking planes, 



thereby preventing appreciable damage 
to material at this station," says the 
citation for the Distinguished Service 
Cross awarded him. 

He was awarded the Oak Leaf Clus- 
ter for "extraordinary heroism" later. 
During an attack on the airdrome at 
Batangas by 54 enemy bombers, Cap- 
tain Villamor took off and led six pur- 
suit planes to engage the enemy. He and 
his companions succeeded in driving the 
enemy bombers away. Villamor himself 
downed one of them. 

"I am proud of our people," says 
Major Villamor. "I am proud of the 
way they fought the enemy from the 
beginning to the end of the Philippine 
campaign. I am proud of their magnifi- 
cent and soul-stirring fight in the jun- 
gles of Bataan and the rocky fortress of 
Corregidor. I am proud of the way 
they have consistantly resisted enemy 
occupation and control. And I am proud 
of the brave manner they are presently 
undergoing sufferings to demonstrate to 
future generations that our people, 
when the true test came, were not found 
wanting." 

Major Villamor, who is 29 years old, 
is five feet, four inches tall, and weighs 



128 pounds, is the son of one of the 
Philippines most distinguished jurists. 
He took up commercial aviation. Later 
he joined the Philippine Army and was 
sent to Randolph Field, Texas, for fur- 
ther training, specializing in aerial 
photography. He is now with the United 
States Air Force. 

Major Villamor has a message to the 
people of the United States. 

"It is a message from the Filipino 
people," he says. "It was never ex- 
pressed to me, but I have seen it clearly 
in the tear-filled eyes of a mother star- 
ing at a hungry and dying child, in the 
steady fingers of a guerrilla about to 
pull the trigger on an approaching Jap, 
in the untiring and devoted efforts of 
our leaders — military and civil, in the 
ghastly spectacle of entire families dead 
from malaria, in the efforts and sacri- 
fices of all the people in all areas in the 
Philippines. It is this: Tell America 
that over here we do not pray for vic- 
tory, for victory is sure to come. Rather 
we pray that God may speed the day 
of their coming which shall be the day 
when we can once again breathe the 
air of peace and liberty."
