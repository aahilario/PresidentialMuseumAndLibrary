Malacanang, Manila, 
and 

To the Honorable President of the Philippine Senate, 

Legislative Building, 

Manila. 

Dear Sirs: 

With due respect, the undersigned have taken the 
liberty to present to you in book form the memorials, 
resolutions, and petitions, the original copies of which were 
sent to you by the petitioners themselves, urging the ap- 
pointment of the Hon. Felipe E. Jose, delegate to the Con- 
stitutional Convention, to the mayorship of Baguio as soon 
as this office is vacated by the present incumbent, Mayor 
E. J. Halsema. 

Very respectfully,

FOREWORD 

The spontaneous and friendly spirit of the various 
memorials and resolutions compiled herein has prompted 
the publication thereof in book form. And the ob- 
jective in this effort is merely to present these docu- 
ments again to the authorities concerned in a form that 
will make their perusal less boresome. Besides, it is more 
convenient to keep a book than a file of loose-leaf type- 
written papers. 

There is no need here for an elaborate discourse on 
the outstanding qualities of the man recommended in these 
memorials and resolutions for appointment to be the first 
Filipino mayor of the City of Baguio. For Mr Felipe E. 
Jose as a private citizen and as a public man, is amply 
and duly appraised in the memorials and resolutions print- 
ed m this volume. No better appraisal of him could have 
been made. These memorials and resolutions were con- 
ceived and written by men of different callings, in dif- 

Zl r7£ V hf6; th6y are men of hi * h Ending i"

His is the distinction of having been recommended 
for appointment to an important public office in so many 
memorials, resolutions, and petitions, unsolicited. 

As a delegate for Baguio to the Constitutional Con- 
vention, the Journals of Session of that august body will 
suffice to prove his worth in that capacity. He was a 
member of seven committees of the Convention; i.e., Con- 
vention Membership, Committee, Immigration, Suffrage, 
Labor and Public Welfare, Impeachment, Insular Police, 
Nationalization and Conservation of Lands and Natural 
Resources, and Special Provinces. As a member of the 
Baguio City Council from 1931 to 1934, the resolution of 
the present council printed in this book speaks well of his 
public career. As a member of the Mixed Independence 
Mission to the United States in 1933, he did his part cre- 
ditably. 

If the selection of the new mayor of Baguio were by 
popular vote, doubtless Mr. Felipe E. Jose would easily 
emerge triumphant, for the number of signers of the me- 
morials, resolutions, and petitions printed herein exceeds 
the number of voters who cast their votes in the last gen- 
eral elections in Baguio.

Baguio wants a Neiv Deal. Its people need it. And 
thanks to the inborn love of liberty and justice of the 
American people, that New Deal so long delayed and so 
long hoped for will soon become a reality. By opera- 
tion of the Tydings-McDuffie Independence Law, Amer- 
ican officials in every branch of the Philippine govern- 
ment will soon relinquish their responsibilities to Fili- 
pinos, and Baguio's appointive officials are no exception. 
Only recently, the American mayor of Baguio, Mr. E. J. 
Halsema, tendered his resignation. The occasion thus be- 
comes opportune for the appointment of a capable Fili- 
pino to head the administration of the City of Baguio. 

Among those mentioned as possibilities to succeed 
Mayor Halsema, Hon. Felipe E. Jose, senior delegate to 
the Constitutional Convention and onetime member of 
the City Council of Baguio, is the most prominent, me 
people of Baguio have long realized Delegate Joses out- 
standing qualities, and long before Mayor Halsema 
filed an application for retirement they had f orwardea a 
memorial urging the appointment of Hon. Felipe k. J ° 
as Baguio's first Filipino mayor. More than 
Baguio's leading citizens signed, and sent the folio* 
memorial on June 29, 1934 :

In the wake of this memorial there flowed a stream 
of resolutions, letters and cablegrams addressed to Gov- 
ernor-General Murphy, President Quezon and other na- 
tional leaders, thus giving a national scope to the movement 
the object of which is to make Delegate Jose the successor 
to Mayor Halsema. Before leaving for the United States 
to assume his duties as Philippine Resident Commissioner, 
Representative Francisco A. Delgado wrote Governor-Gen- 
eral Murphy the following self-explanatory letter: 



Manila, P. L 
October 13, 1934 

Dear Governor: 

Before leaving for the United States to assume my 
duties as Philippine Resident Commissioner, allow me to 
address Your Excellency on behalf of my friend, Hon. Fe- 
lipe E. Jose. You will perhaps recall that Mr. Jose was 
one of those proposed to you by President Quezon for ap- 
pointive representative from the Mountain Province. 

I understand that Mr. Jose has been groomed by the 
citizens of Baguio and by various other people for the 
mayoralty of Baguio in the event the present incumbent 
relinquishes the office. I desire to express to Your Ex- 
cellency my whole-hearted support of the movement. 

Mr. Jose has been a friend of mine of long standing. 
During the years of our association, I have always known 
him to be a man of sincere motives and of conviction. I n 
private life and in public service, I have observed that his 
one abiding ambition is to serve the working class of which 
he is one and for whom he is a true spokesman. He may 
be outspoken sometimes, but his assertiveness is always 

21 



tempered with a readiness to respect others' views and 
rights. In fine, dear Governor, Mr. Jose would make an 
ideal executive. 

With sincere regards, I remain 

Yours very sincerely, 

(Sgd.) FRANCISCO A. DELGADO 

Resident Commissioner 

His Excellency 

The Governor General

OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF THE 
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS 

Manila, March 28, 1935. 

Gentlemen : 

I am directed by the Governor-General to acknowledge 
receipt of your resolution No. 307, current series, recom- 
mending Hon. Felipe E. Jose for appointment as Mayor of 
the City of Baguio should the present incumbent relinquish 
his post, and to inform you that he has ordered it placed 
on file for consideration when the proper time comes. 
Very respectfully,

That Delegate Felipe E. Jose's appointment as mayor 
of Baguio finds support among business leaders, profes- 
sionals and independent citizens is evidenced by the sup- 
port given the movement to appoint him mayor by such 
notable figures as Don Leopoldo Khan, Don Leopoldo R. 
Aguinaldo and several others. In fact, upon the resig- 
nation of Mayor Halsema from office, Baguio's leading 
professional and business leaders sent the following testi- 
monials of Delegate Felipe E. Jose's worth as a private 
citizen and as a public servant to Governor-General Mur- 
Phy and to President Quezon:

Dear Sir:

We have k G E ' Jose to succeed him - 

teerity loval tTZ n Mr ' Felipe E - Jose to be a man of in " 
J lo the sovereign government of the United 



28 



States and one who loves his country very dearly. As a 
citizen he is law-abiding and peaceful. We have had an 
opportunity to observe and study him as a public man, 
and that was when he served in the City Council of Baguio 
to which body he was elected by popular vote for the term 
1931-1934. We found him to be a conscientious and hard- 
working public servant, honest, efficient, upright and pos- 
sessed of good judgment. Mr. Jose polled the largest num- 
ber of votes in the election of the two delegates for Ba- 
guio to the Constitutional Convention. 

We believe and hold that the circumstance of Mr. 
Jose's being a labor leader cannot be a drawback to a pro- 
gram of efficient and honest administration of Baguio 
in the event he is appointed. He is a responsible man with 
a high sense of duty, and a responsible man will not be- 
tray a trust which comes to him under oath. A man of 
integrity, he will not, we are confident, be found wanting. 
Besides, his spirit of fair play and his broad-mindedness 
displayed in his dealings with people in all walks of life 
are guaranty enough that, if appointed, he will give Ba- 
guio a governmental administration satisfactory to all its 
inhabitants. And he will give everybody a square deal, 
too. Mr. Jose speaks and writes English, Spanish, Taga- 
log, Ilocano and Pangasinan. 

Permit us to state that we have no complaint what- 
soever against the present administration of Baguio, much 
less against Mayor Halsema personally. 

Very respectfully, 



Baguio, Mt. Province

Hon. Manuel L. Quezon.

Dear Sir: 

We are sending you copy of a letter of even date, 
which is self-explanatory. The latter is attached hereto!

Please be advised that we are making: this petition to 
you and to the Governor-General of our own accord, with- 
out the knowledge and consent of Mr. Felipe E. Jose. This 
we have done and will do again if necessary, because we 
know full well that Mr. Felipe E. Jose is an able man, 
honest, good, hard-working, reliable. 

We should like to emphasize the fact that we, whose 
signatures appear below, know the conditions of Baguio 
and have the welfare of its community at heart. We be- 
lieve that a man of rugged honesty regardless of his po- 
litical affiliation should be chosen to run the affairs of 
this city. Of course, there are many other men equally 
capable, if not more capable, but we refuse to believe that 
there is any man other than he who enjoys better the con- 
fidence of the people of Baguio. 

Let us add here that as a public man the record of 
Mr. Felipe E. Jose has been exemplary. His accomplish- 
ments as member of the Baguio City Council from 1931 to 
1934 are a matter of record. His ability he has demons- 
trated not only as a councilor but also as a delegate to the 
Constitutional Convention to which body he was elected in 
Baguio with the highest number of votes.

September 21, 1934. 

Dear Colleague: 

Allow me to express to you my sincere appreciation 
for your kindness in affixing your signature to the resolu- 
tion endorsing my appointment as Mayor of the City of 
Baguio to His Excellency, the Governor-General, and the 
Filipino leaders. No one knows more than I do my limit- 
ations, and it is a great source of pride on my part to 
note that I have many friends who, likewise being cogni- 
zant thereof, could still place great trust in me. 

Your expression of faith in me, I shall forever cherish 
in my heart, and time cannot efface from my memory a 
friendly act so graciously done. My only hope is that I 
may be able to repay sometime, somehow and I trust that 
you will always consider my humble self at your command. 
Yours very sincerely, 

FELIPE E. JOSE.

for Baguio, as mayor for the City of Baguio. 

We are honest in our conviction that his appointment

Jose, namely: 

1. He is honest, sincere, loyal, industrious, and pub- 
lic-spirited ; 

2. He speaks English, Spanish, Tagalog, Pumpango, 
Igorot, and Ilocano; 

3. He is delegate for Baguio, and present councilor 
for the City of Baguio. 

Hoping that this petition will be given your kind con- 
sideration.

RESOLUTION 
WHEREAS, with the recent resignation from office 
of the Honorable E. J. Halsema as City Mayor of Baguio, 
the appointment of a Filipino to the mayoralty of Baguio 
comes as a logical step in view of assumption of the rights 
and responsibilities of self-government by the Filipino peo- 
ple under the forthcoming Commonwealth Government; 
and 

WHEREAS, should the Administration and the Fili- 
pino participation decide upon the Filipinization of the of- 
fice of mayor of Baguio as sagacious statesmanship and 
political wisdom would demand, the appointment of Hon- 
orable Felipe E. Jose, Baguio's senior delegate to the Con- 
stitutional Convention and one-time member of its City 
Council, which has been urged by its cosmopolitan citizen- 
ry and by various governmental bodies, civic entities, and 

49 



by well-known business and political personages in and 
out of Baguio demands the serious attention and consider- 
ation of the Administration and the Filipino participation 
in the Government now that the mayoralty of the City of 
Baguio has become vacant; and 

WHEREAS, we add to the various qualifications of 
Honorable Felipe E. Jose advanced by the supporters of 
the movement for his appointment as mayor of Baguio 
his distinguished qualities as a labor leader, his high sense 
of duty, his moral integrity, his broadmindedness, vision 
and patriotism, — qualities needed in an office of trust and 
responsibility as the Mayoralty of a City like Baguio ; 

THEREFORE, be it resolved as it is hereby resolved, 
by the Philippine National Confederation of Workers and 
Peasants, to express its sense that Honorable Felipe E. 
Jose deserves the appointment and is the logical and best 
appointee to the office of Mayor of Baguio.

Provincial Committee 
With the almost universal clamor for the appointment 
of Honorable Felipe E. Jose as first Filipino mayor of 
the City of Baguio, his appointment to the office becomes 
at once logical and apposite, — logical, because he possesses 
the qualities needed of a good city executive; — and appo- 
site, because it conforms to the wishes of the people of 
Baguio. With Delegate Jose's appointment, Baguio's pray- 
er for a New Deal shall have been answered. Let it there- 
fore be so as no government can be successful if it ig- 
nores the wishes of the governed.

"A good mixer, an indefatigable worker, a man of 
broad sympathies, there are not many who could qualify 
as excellently for the post of Mayor of Baguio as dele- 
gate Felipe Jose. In a cosmopolitan city like Bagnio, cos- 
mopolite in the sense that therein converge the main ele- 
ments making the Filipino people. A man of as broad 
knowledge of his people, endowed with a facility of lan- 
guage and a possession of nearly all the dialects, Mr. Jose ' 
more than any man I know fits splendidly to the po^ 01 
Baguio Executive. He comes from the masses but his 
sympathies are not limited to class. He is as much at 
ease with the masses as with the property owners. He is 
thereby qualified to look after the interests, not only of the 
poor but also of the rich, an essential qualification tor a 
useful and successful Executive/'

"The improvement of a community depends in a large

DAVID PEREZ DE TAGLE 
De La Opinion. 



The City of Baguio being very cosmopolitan, needs 
for its Chief Executive a man who is well liked and l 0Ve d 
by all— the forgotten men, the capitalists, the Profession, 
als, the leaders and the tax-paying public. Hon. Felipe 
E. Jose, former elderman and delegate to the Constitution, 
at Convention, undoubtedly meets such qualifications f 0 ^ 
the Chief Executive of the summer Capital of the Phij, 

59 



ippines. The memorials, resolutions, petitions and letters 
published herein, which are authentic copies of the origin- 
als submitted to his Excellency the Governor General, and 
the Filipino leaders are tangible proofs supporting my 
assertion. In fact, in my humble opinion, no better person 
can be selected for the position of Mayor of the city of 
Eaguio than Hon. Felipe E. Jose, who has the absolute 
confidence of the leaders and the citizenry. His appoint- 
ment for any responsible position in our government would 
mean a vindication of the laboring class.
