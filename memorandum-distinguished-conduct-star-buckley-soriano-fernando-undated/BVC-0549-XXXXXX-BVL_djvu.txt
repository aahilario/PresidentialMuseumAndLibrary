ivEMORANDUM FOR 

HIS EXCELLENCY, THE PRESIDENT 


I have the honor to recommend that the DISTINGUISHED 
CONDUCT STAR of the Philippines be awarded to Lieut, J. D, 
Buckley, U.S. Navy, Commander of the P.T, boat that trans- 
ported His Excellency, the President, his fanily, and other 
members of his party, from Dumaguete, Negros Oriental to 
Oroquieta, Misamis, and to torpedomen James Vallejo and 
John Houlihan of the same boat, for extraordinary coolness 
in face of danger. Their quick action in dropping the 
torpedoes, the mecliAnism of which had been set into action 
by the breaking of the retaining pins, saved the lives of 
all those aboard, 

I likewise recommend that the DISTINGUISHED SERVICE 
STAR of the Philippines be awarded to Lieut. Colonel 
Andres Soriano, Inf. Res., F.A., and Major Basilio Fernando, 
Air Corps, P.A,, for the valuable information obtained 
through their flight on an unarmed transport plane over 
the Visayan Seas where, according to telegraphic reports, 
enemy destroyers had been seen. Their report made possible 
the continuation of the projected of His Excellency and 
party to Mindanao inspite of unfavorable telegraphic reports. 
During the trip on the P.T, boat from PHimaguete to Oroquieta, 
Lieut. Colonel Sorianoâ€™s presence of mind greatly assisted 
Lieut, Buckley in reassuring the President and hia family 
that disaster had been averted and that everything was all 
right. 

Attached hereto are the general orders awarding these 
decorations.
