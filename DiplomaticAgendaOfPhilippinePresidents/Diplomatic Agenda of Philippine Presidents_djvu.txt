pines and the Filipino people for the dam^es and injiuies they had

1 5 MARCH - US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles called on 
President Magsaysay to discuss outstanding issues in Philippine-US 
relations. Dulles related to the President his impressions of the 
SEATO council meeting at Karachi, Pakistan, and said he found out 
that peace in Southeast Asia was more secure now than it has been in 
the past few years. He also spoke of his visit to various Asian capitals. 



The President reiterated the support of the Philippines for the 
efforts of the SEATO countries in uniting defensively against the 
threat of Communism in this area. He briefed Mr. Dulles about the 
shift in tactics of the Communists in the Philippines. He said that the 
latter had turned to economic sabotage in their drive to imdermine 
the people's confidence in the government but assured Dulles that 
the government was in full control of the situation. Dulles, in turn, 
assured the President of continued support of the United States 
for the Philippines in the latter 's efforts towards economic security. 
They agreed that economic stability was one of the conditions 
needed for the defense of democracy in Asia. Dulles reiterated 
President Eisenhower's invitation to President Magsaysay to visit 
the United States. But the President said that he felt he might not 
be able to go this year owing to pressure of work at home.

he may go on a state visit to the United States and to some other 
countries of Europe and Asia next year.

his sojourn in the Philippines, he will endeavor *^to find ways of 
increasing trade, to extend our cooperation under the Colombo 
Plan, to strengthen the ties which bind us through the Manila 
Treaty." In response. President Magsaysay said that the mutual 
elevation by *'our two governments of the category of our diplo- 
matic missions from one of legation to that of embassy underlines 
the importance we attach to the need for greater economic, social, 
and political relations between our two peoples, to our mutual 
concern as neighbors and allies in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organ- 
ization, and to the maintenance of universal peace and security."

trials."

17 MAY - In a conference with Congressional leaders, it was 
agreed that President Magsaysay will call a special session of Congress 
for the ratification of the reparations agreement and the Japanese 
peace treaty only after the Japanese Diet has acted on both pacts. 
The President will proclaim a special session for that piirpose as soon 
as he is officially informed by Vice-President and concurrently Secre- 
tary for Foreign Affairs Carlos P. Garcia that the Japanese Diet has 
already approved both. 

1 9 MAY - President Magsaysay directed Vice-President Carlos P. 
Garcia, chairman of the Philippine panel that is preparing the ground 
for the forthcoming Philippine-United States bases treaty talks, to 
give top-priority consideration to the problems of delimitation of 
the bases and jurisdictional conflicts. The President said that the 
panel should also take up the turnover of temporary installations 
of the US Government to the Phihppine Government. 

A Malacanang spokesman said that with respect to the sovereign- 
ty over, and title to, the bases, the position of the Philippine Govern- 
ment on these matters is that U.S. possession of the bases is a mere 
grant by the PhUippine RepubUc in the exercise of the latter s 
sovereignty and title. The spokesman said the President wanted 
the Philippine panel to concentrate its attention on the problems 
of delimitation of bases and jurisdictional confUcts because ne 
hoped to eliminate at the earliest time all possible causes of conflicts 
that tended to impair Filipino-American relations. Most of these 
causes, the spokesman added, arose from these two problems. 

30 MAY - Upon recommendation of the Vice-President, the Ca- 
binet approved the extension of the Philippine-Japan ^^^^ 
financial barter trade agreements up to August 31, 1956. The ^*^"^P*

Japanese peace treaty took effect on April 28, 1952.

6 AUGUST - President Magsaysay and Congressional leaders 
listened to Vice-President and concurrently Foreign Affairs Secretary 



Presiden t Magsaysay 65 



Carlos P. Garcia's report that the Philippine panel on the negotiation 
on the bases agreement has formally adopted the Magsaysay-Nixon 
statement last July 3 as its basic guidepost during the talks. 

President Magsaysay and U.S. Vice-President Richard M. Nixon, 
during the latter's visit to Manila last July for the tenth anniversary 
of Philippine Independence, issued a joint statement on military 
bases in this country which laid down three principles which will 
guide the forthcoming negotiations. These principles adopted by the 
Philippine panel as its guideposts are as follows: 

1 ) The existence of a system of United States bases in the Philip- 
pines has been, and continues to be, a matter of mutual inte- 
rest and concern to the two countries, for the purpose of in- 
suring their common defense pursuant to the principles of the 
United Nations, 



2) In consonance with this mutuality of interest and concern, 
certain land areas in the Philippines have been and are being 
used by the United States as bases. The Philippine Government 
will contribute to their use in accordance with the terms ofthe 
Military Bases Agreement, the additional land which is deemed 
necessary by both governments for the strengthening of the 
bases system; the United States will turn over to the Philip- 
pine Government those areas listed in the Military Bases Agree- 
ment which the parties may hereafter agree are no longer 
needed. In addition, the United States has contributed and will 
contribute such personnel, equipment, and physical facilities 
as may be necessary for the effective maintenance of such 
bases for the defense of the Philippines and the United States 
in this area. 



3) The United States has, since the independence of the Philip- 
pines, always acknowledged the sovereignty ofthe Philippines 
over such bases and expressly reaffirms full recognition of such 
Philippine sovereignty over the bases. Further, the United 
States will transfer and turn over to the Philippines all title 
papers and title claims held by the United States to all land 
areas used either in the past or at present as military bases, 
except those areas which may now or will be used by the 
United States for the diplomatic and consular establishment. 
Such transfer of title papers and title claims will not affect the 
use ofthe bases in accordance with the terms of the Military 
Bases Agreement, 



66 Diplomatic Agenda of Philippine Presidents 



The foregoing is of vital importance because it reversed the in- 
terpretation made three years earlier by US Attorney General Her- 
bert Brownell to the effect that — 



"On the basis of the Tydings-McDuffie Law, title to the Ame- 
rican bases in the Philippines was retained by the United States. 
Therefore, all issues pertaining to jurisdiction shall be under the de- 
termination of the United States for the right to exercise US sove- 
reignty over the bases covers both procedural and substantive law. " 



9 AUGUST — President Magsaysay discussed the expansion of 
trade between the Philippines and Japan with members of the good-

"We have to admit realistically, however, that this cause still

the generation also of defense power to forestall aggression. In this 
regard, we have to rely on friends and allies. 

Our staunchest friend and ally is America with whom we have 
a treaty of mutual defense, which even now is being perfected to 
bring It closer to the ideal basis of sovereign equality. 

To this end, exploratory talks on the diplomatic level are be-

question of military bases in this country, redefining the mutual de-

menu with the United States. 

"Without veering away from America, but rather in pursuit of 
our own resolution to help in spreading the gospel of democracy in 
Asia, we have drawn ourselves closer to our immediate neighbors in 
this part of the globe. Last year, I paid visits of state, first, to the 
United States, then to Japan. In both countries. I was received with 
the utmost cordiality and warm friendship as President of the Re- 
public, I feel that, more than anything else, both visits resulted in 
the priceless boon of closer understanding and mutual esteem bet- 
ween the two countries and ours. " 

"In our policy of moving closer to our neighbors in Asia, we 
have tightened bonds of amity with them to a greater measure than 
heretofore-with South Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, 
Nationalist China, Laos, Cambodia, India, Burma, and Malaya. The 
President of South Vietnam and the Prime Minister of Malaya were 
recently distinguished state visitors of our country. I propose to re- 
turn such visits as soon as possible. As opportunity offers, I shall_ 
visit as many Asian countries as possible to attest in deeds our avowed 
desire to be their friend and good neighbour."

Philippines to put its economic affairs in order would not a^"^® 
complete success without effective international action to ^ 
weaknesses of the world monetary, financial, and trade ^ys •

munist element. Asked if he agreed with some observations in the US 
Congress that, in the face of turmoil in the opposition parties and the 
communist insurgency, the Philippines would become the next Iran, 
Reagan said: "I certainly hope not. We're trying to be as helpful as 
we can in that situation. He said the Philippines and the United States

been some movements towards reforms in recent months and the

tee on Asia voted a 1986 foreign aid bill that slashed President Rea-

President Marcos 41 9 



1 2 APRIL — Malaysian Foreign Minister Tengku Ahmad Rithau- 
deen called on President Marcos at Malacanang. During their talks, 
President Marcos yesterday warned against certain forces, which, 
having already established hegemony over a large part of Southeast 
Asia (SEA), would now seek to break up the Association of South- 
east Asian Nations (ASEAN). He said it was only ASEAN's collective 
vigilance and firm commitment which foiled the expansionist designs 
of the forces earlier mentioned. He called for closer cooperation and 
understanding among all ASEAN countries. At the same time, Mr. 
Marcos conceded that "certain issues'* remained unresolved between 
Malaysia' and the Philippines, althou^ he held that these differences 
did not mar their ties or deter their efforts to resolve them. "We can 
hope indeed for healthy growth out of the little differences that have 
divided us,'' the President said. On the other hand, he said, it was 
necessary to seek an amicable solution because the two countries 
must face more important issues besides taking part in addressing 
issues impinging on the stability and welfare of the region. "The 
sooner we mend the differences that have somehow come between 
us, the sooner too will we be able to imdertake the tasks which our 
respective national destmies as well as regional geopolitics have 
placed upon our two countries, and for that matter, ASEAN as a 
whole," he said. He pledged that the Philippines would stand by the 
alliance and spirit of cooperation traditionally binding the two coun- 
tries. Minister Rithaudeen declared his government was confident 
and optimistic about the commitment of ASEAN members to up- 
hold and enhance the spirit of ASEAN for greater understanding and 
cooperation. He pointed the spirit of ASEAN for greater understand- 
ing and cooperation. He pointed out the Kampuchean problem as 
one which the ASEAN could overcome with more determination and 
cooperation among member nations "and with help fi^om other 
countries." Rithaudeen said: "ASEAN should continue to work hard 
to find a solution to the Kampuchean problem and the realization of 
a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in Southeast Asia." He said 
he was sure Malaysia and the Philippines could implement greater 
and closer bilateral cooperation for their own benefit and for 
ASEAN 's benefit. Malaysian Foreign Minister Tengku Ahmad 
Rithaudeen discussed yesterday with acting Foreign Affairs Minister 
Pacifico A. Castro a Vietnam proposal to solve the Kampuchean 
problem and trade ties between Malaysia and the Philippines. During 
a call at the foreign ministry, Rithaudeen, who is currently chairman 
of the ASEAN standing committee, told Castro that the Kampu- 
chean issue will be taken up at the next ASEAN foreign ministers' 
meeting in Kuala Lumpur in July. Vietnam's five-point proposal calls

for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea together 
with the elimination of Pol Pot; self-determination without Pol Pot; 
freeze on foreign bases in the region; international control and super- 
vision; and guarantee by foreign powers for security of Southeast 
Asian states. Rithaudeen and Castro also discussed economic coope- 
ration and ways of expanding bilateral trade. The Philippine trade 
deficit with Malaysia for 1984 amounts to $184 million, which the 
Philippines desires to correct by increasing its volume of exports to 
Malaysia. The total Philippine-Malaysian trade for the period from 
January to December 1984 amounted to $374.3 million. Of this 
amount, Philippine exports totalled $136.3 million, while its imports 
reached $237.9 million. 



15 APRIL - Muslim World League Secretary General Abdullah 
Omar Nasseef was received by President Marcos at Malacanang

dedicated to the propagation of the Islamic faith and the promotion 
ot peace and friendship among nations. In reply to the President, Nas- 
seef said that the World Muslim League and the Organization of the 
islamic Conference (OIC) will work together to bring about the 
oiution of the problem in the South. Nasseef said he was elated to

President Marcos told three visiting United States congressmen 
tnat as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, he has always taken 
the initiative in reforms to improve the capability of the military 
against insurgency. The President said that he valued advice from 
those concerned over developments in the Philippines. However, he 
stressed that decisions must take into consideration the peculiar cir- 



President Marcos 421 



cumstances affecting the country. He further told the American law- 
makers that contrary to information they may have gathered, the 
Commission on Elections has opposition members. In fact, he said, 
it was he who asked the opposition to nominate their representatives 
in the constitutional body. However, he explained, the Comelec, 
being a constitutional body, does not represent any parly in super- 
vising the conduct of elections. The President stressed this point in a 
talk with US Rep. Stephen Solarz (Democrat, New York), Rep. 
Gerald Solomon (Republican, New York), and Rep. William Richard- 
son (Democrat, New Mexico) at Malacanang. The three US law- 
makers arrived in Manila on a brief visit to talk with top government

ments in the coimtry.

the Western countries. She proposed a bilateral trans-shipment agree- 
ment during talks with Minister Wu in Malacanang. Mrs. Marcos said

Taking up the issue of trade, the President said the Philippines 
would like to set up a trade center in Japan to give Filipinos an 
understanding of the intricacies of trade between the two countries. 
He said Japan helped ThaUand put up such a center in Japan. 

Likewise, the President pointed out that the tax imposed on 
Philippine-made garments exported to Japan is not based on Hie 
"value added" principle but on "total value." 

The President also cited the heavy tax Japan imposes on Philip- 
pine bananas, as well as its quota on pineapple and papaya imports. 
He also brought up the Japanese ban on the use of insecticides, fumi- 
gation, and the like on bananas, pineapples and mangoes exported by 
the Philippines. He said that while the use of Philippine-made cartons 
for bananas was already resolved, the tax for Philippine bananas has 
remained at 17.5% as against 10% for bananas from other countries. 
The President expressed hope that tiie situation could be remedied as 
soon as possible. 

17 MAY - President Marcos branded as "baseless" the US 
Senate's call for reforms in the Philippines, saying that "these re- 
forms had been started way back." 

The President issued statement in reply to US Senator John 
Kerry's resolution approved by the US Senate urging tiie institution 
of reforms which were made as conditions for future aid to the 
Philippines. 

As this developed, the President alsa vowed that as long as the 
Communist insurgents roam the countryside, the government will 
not relax its defenses and will not relent in its efforts to secure the 
people's sacred ri^t to a life of freedom and dignity- 

The President broke his silence on the US Senate resolution in 
an interview with Robert Page, president and publisher of the Tii- 
cago Sun Times, who was in Manila on a short visit. 

"He (Kerry) ought to know tiiat these reforms had t^n started 
way back," the President said when asked to comment on Kerry's 
statement. "We have a constitutional electoral commission in place, 
where neutral persons are appointed as commissioners to oversee and 
supervise the elections," the President added. 



426 Diplomatic Agenda of Philippine Presidents 

Senator Kerry, a recent Manila visitor, was reported to have 
raised the question of an independent and impartial Commission on 
Elections which he called "essential for monitoring and guaranteeing 
free and honest elections." 

The US Senate resolution had earlier drawn a sharp retort from 
two Philippine officials, Batasan Speaker Nicanor Yniguez and Po- 
litical Affairs Minister Leonardo B. Perez. 

Yniguez called the Senate resolution "arrogant" and "pre- 
sumptuous." Perez, on the other hand, described the resolution as 
"characteristic of the penchant of some American politicians for 
meddling in purely internal Philippine affairs." 



19 MAY — President Marcos expressed confidence that the US 
Government will comply with its obligations under the amended 
RP-US MiHtary Bases Agreement signed last 1 June 1984. 

aff J^?^ Pi^esident based his optimism on President Reagan's "best 
eiiort letter" wherein the US President pledged to work for Congres- 
sional approval of a US$900-million appropriation as compensation 

facilities at Clark Air Base and Subic Naval 
cr^r. starting 1 October 1984. The US$900-million 

U?«?9? P^^^^® is broken down as follows: military assistance.

21 MAY — President Marcos said that the finalization of the 
US$3.9 billion financial package for the Philippines by the 483 



President Marcos 42 7 



creditor- banks would mark an upward swing toward expanded eco- 
nomic activity. 

The President noted that this was the cuknination of ahnost 
three years of negotiation for the package which is the keystone of 
the national economic recovery program. He said that this "demon- 
strates the confidence of the international financial community in 
the capacity and the determination of the Filipino people to re- 
bound from their present economic difficulties." 

The package includes US$925 million in new loans and US$3 
billion in trade credits. 

Prime Minister Cesar Virata and Central Bank Governor Jose 
Fernandez signed the loan documents 20 May at the New York head- 
quarters of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., leader of the 12-mem- 
ber advisory committee of creditor banks. 

27 MAY — President Marcos was the guest of honor at the cele- 
bration of American Memorial Day held at the US cemetery in Fort 
Bonifacio. Quoted hereunder are excerpts of the President's speech 
delivered at the said occasion: 

''Relations between America and the Philippines date now 
nearly a century, and after all these many years marked both by the 
adversities of war and the challenges of peace, I think we all know 
what our bonds of friendship stand for and why they abide despite 
the march of the years. 

'They abide, if I may say so, because these bonds are firmly 
planted in our hearts, like the crossses that dot these grounds m 
memory of our war dead. 

"We hear from time to time about the difficulties and misun- 
derstandings that through the years have beclouded the relations 
between our peoples and our governments. Yet these have always 
been insignificant in the face of the sacrifices of Filipinos and Ameri- 
cans for the values they share in common and the causes they believe 
in and are willing to die for. 

"It is this sense of sharing between our peoples that we are 
privileged to extol together and perpetuate at these rites of remem- 
brance for America's war dead here in the Philippines and all over 
the world. Each of the thousands of white crosses that forest this 
hollowed ground represents a unique and precious life which had 



428 Diplomatic Agenda of Philippine Presidents 



been given up in order that we and the coming generations may 
enjoy the blessings of freedom. 

"In the Third World where there is so much of the contempo- 
rary struggle for democracy is taking place, we faced problems posed 
not only by the formidable adversary of democracy. We also must 
learn to appreciate what it means for a developing country to be 
both an ally of America and a free and sovereign nation at the same 
time. 

"For there are well meaning friends in the West who do not

On his part, Ambassador McLaren said Great Britain and the 
Philippmes have much to offer to each other, both bilaterally and as 
members of the European Economic Community and ASEAN, re- 
spectively, in an increasing interdependent world. 

31 MAY ~ US Assistant Secretary of State Paul Wolfowitz h^ 
declared that it is up to Filipinos "to choose then: particular path and 
make the reforms they judge necessary'* in the Philippines. 

'*It is not our place as Americans to choose or anoint individual 
leaders (in the Philippines), be they of the government, the opposi- 
tion, the private sector, or the military,'' he said. Wolfowitz's views 
were stated in a digest of US policy published by the State Depart- 
ment's Bureau of Public Affairs. 

"Political observers said the remarks apparently dampened op- 
position calls for US interference in Philippine affairs. 

"Our current efforts to help the Filipinos," Wolfowitz stated, 
should concentrate on the following three general areas: 

'"First, support for the growth of democratic institutions -the 
United States will continue to support the effort to guarantee 
and fair local elections in 1986 and presidential elections in 1987, 
although we must recognize that on such critical questions as elec- 
toral codes and election monitoring, it is the Filipinos themselves 
who must decide what is necessary. 

"'Second, support for efforts to move the Philippine economy 
back to a free market orientation — we will continue to support the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) reforms. Beyond that our as- 
sistance will continue to aim at encouragir^ reforms needed to estao- 
lish a free market environment as the basis for long-term growth. 

""Third — we will provide enhanced military assistance with the 
full expectation that reform programs already begun will continue 
and expand. " 

1 JUNE - US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Mi- 
chael Armacost was received by President Marcos at Malacanang. 
During the call, the President told Armacost, a former US ambassa- 
dor to the Philippines that there would be definitely no snap elec- 
tions and that the Constitution would be followed; local elections on 
12 May 1986, and presidential election on 12 May 1987. 



430 Diplomatic Agenda of Philippine Presidents 



The President said that with the two elections scheduled firmly 
for the next two years, the time slot open for synchronized elections 
"would probably be in 1990." The President also briefed Armacost 
on reforms being implemented in the Armed Forces. 

3 JUNE — Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs Pacifico A. Castro, 
speaking at the "Kapihan sa May nila," explained the Government's 
pohcy on the Sabah issue. Minister Castro said the President had 
choice to discuss the Sabah issue with Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir dturing their bilateral meeting in Brunei last year. There 
nave been "contacts and conversations" between the two govern- 
ments on the highest level to find a solution to this issue. 

5 JUNE — President Marcos delivered a speech in Malacanang on 
s^t ?f °^ anniversary of the International Rice Re- 

earcn Institute. Quoted hereunder are excerpts of the said speech: 

, '"^^^ Quarter-century of International Rice Research Insti- 
tute s existence takes its meaning, if I may venture to say, from the 
tecnnological revolution it has wrought not in the laboratory, but in 

yields of rice farms and the incomes of rice farmers here in the 
fnilippines and in the rest of Asia and Africa. 

„„ "V^f crusade against world hunger must continue and this is 
nt stock once again of the pledge made

th.V "!! "° f^"'' '"s <^y '« bread' 'at the end of 

me decade of the '70's. Eleven years have passed since that pledge 
was made by the international community, and yet the vision and

me ought on millions of lives in the developing world The famine 
mat now stalks Ethiopia and other African countries in the Sahelian 
^one is a painful reminder to all of us that the scourge is still un- 



"Speaking for the developing nations of the South at the Can- 
cun Summit in 1981, 1 called attention to the fact that 21 nations 
throughout the world were hungry, and that 12 other nations were 
on the verge of hunger. Yet even as we were engaged in trying to un- 
ravel the issues between North and South, death from hunger espe- 
cially among children in Asia, Africa, and South America continue 
unabated. 



President Marcos 431 



'The formidable challenge that remains, however, should not 
blind us to the real advances that have been made. The International 
Rice Research Institute represents one major achievement tiiat sure- 
ly has made the meeting of the challenge more feasible, 

'The individual efforts of many countries in Asia and Africa 
represent yet another encouraging indicator. For truly during the 
past two decades, the vision of the green revolution took root in our 
lands. If I refer here mainly to what we in the Philippines have done, 
it is only to illustrate the larger effort that is taking place. 

*7n Cancun, the participating nations agreed that as a first 
priority in solving the world food problem, developing countries 
should evolve their own food strategies, utilizing their own indige- 
nous resources, supplemented by external assistance where necessa- 
ry. The point of our call to action was that no amount of outside 
assistance can or should substitute for our efforts to combat 
hunger. ' ' 



7 JUNE - Fiji Prime Minister Ratu Sir Kamiseme Mara paid a 
courtesy caU on President Marcos at Malacanang. In welcoming tne 
Fiji Prime Minister, President Marcos assured him that the PhUippi^^s 
is ready to consider any proposed agreement with FijU ^ ^^^^^Z 
with the national policy of promoting close ties with neignbormg 
countries. 



1 2 JUNE - In commemoration of the nation's 87th ^nm^^r^ 
of independence, President Marcos delivered a speech at 
Grandstand. Quoted herein are excerpts of his speech entitled uur 
Republic will Prevail and Prosper'': 

'''In a sense the very celebration of Philippine Independence 
on the 12th of June instead of the Fourth of July as once practised, 
is an act that symbolizes our progressive march to authentic inde- 
pendence. 

"For pervasively, particularly during the last ten years, we 
have moved to cut the various fetters on our sovereignty. 

"We have brought to an end the onerous grant of parity rights 
to foreign nationals in our country. 



"We have secured recognition of Philippine sovereignty over 
military bases established by agreement with the United States. 



432 Diplomatic Agenda of Philippine Presidents 



''We opened diplomatic relations with practically all nations, 
including the socialist world, and have ended forever our traditio- 
nal isolation within a so-called ''free world. " And we have forged 
our own individual niche in the councils and forums of the world. 

"In these initiatives, we have not repudiated any of our al- 
liances and friendships, but there is no question that our voice today 
is our own, and not the echo of another's. 

"But national Independence is not our goal alone. A nation 's 
sovereignty, self-government, self-determination — all these which 
we covet for our nation must also find their full realization in the 
political freedom of individuals and in their economic liberation as 
well. "

turned from a goodwill mission to the People's Republic of China 
where he represented the Philippines in commemorative rites mark- 
ing the formal opening of diplomatic relations between the two 
countries 10 years ago. 

In an arrival statement, the young Marcos reported that "in that 
brief span of 10 years the relations between China and the Philip- 
pines have progressed and matured quickly and smoothly, demon- 
strating our common desire and determination to achieve mutuality, 
respect and equality." 

While in China, Governor Marcos met with President Li Xian- 
nian. Acting Prime Minister Wan Li, State CouncUor Ji Pengfei and 
other ranking Chinese officials. 



22 JUNE — In a speech delivered in San Francisco, California, 
marking the 40th anniversary of the signing of the UN Charter, 
fomer Foreign Minister Carlos P. Romulo urged the overhaul of the 
United Nations to "overcome the built-in weaknesses from which the 
UN presently suffers." 

Recalling the euphoria and optimism among the delegates to the 
San Francisco UN Charter Conference in June 1945, Romulo said: 



"We thought we had written the ideal Charter. But we made a 
mistake. It did not save the world. The United Nations has done 
many good things, but it has failed in its main purpose - to prevent 
all wars. " 



2 JULY — President Marcos, citing Japan's reduction of tan«s on 
Southeast Asian products, expressed hope that it would be a begm- 
ning of gradual dismantling of tariff and other trade bamers oy 
developed countries. 

The tariff reduction would benefit PhiUppine bananas, Malay- 
sian palm oil and Thai boneless chicken. Japan's decision to reduce 
tariffs came following the recent Japanese government's meeting m 
Tokyo with ASEAN Economic Ministers, including Trade Minister 
Roberto Ongpin and Economic Planning Minister Vicente Valdepe- 
nas. Jr. 



434 Diplomatic Agenda of Philippine Presidents 



The Japanese tariff for bananas will now be 25% instead of the 
usual 35% charged during the peak banana season. During the off- 
firuit season from April to September, the tariff wUl be 12.5%, down 
by five from the old 17.5%. 

fon^ ^^fu^^®"^* Marcos noted that the Philippines supplies Japan with 
lour-fifths of its banana requirements. 

cavp H^l ^^%Pines exported US$88 million worth of the giant 
enaish bananas, grown mainly in Mindanao, to Japan in 1984.

President Marcos 435 



The President commented that despite the normal irritants in 
the relations between the two countries, "there has always been this 
reservoir, this fount of goodwill between us reminded us that we are 
friends," which has enabled us to reconciliate our differences and re- 
cognize our common interest. He said this "reservoir of goodwill 
must be replenished from generation to generation with deeds that 
renew and honor the ideals that we have stood for together." 

7 JULY — President Marcos cited the efforts of US President 
Ronald Reagan to seek increased assistance for the Philippines under 
the RP-US Military Bases Agreement. 

In an interview with US journalist Stanley Kamow, President 
Marcos said, "I feel that President Reagan has compUed with the ob- 
ligation of the US government with the best-efforts clause of his 
letter to me, as part of the military bases agreement." 

The Chief Executive was commenting on efforts of President 
Reagan to push US Congress approval of increased aid to Jhf Philip- 
pines from US$151 million in 1984 to US$231 million m 1985. ine 
amount is part of the US$900 million assistance to be given to me 
Philippines over a five-year period foUowing the renewal of the Mi- 
litary Bases Agreement in 1983. 

On international relations, the President said that the PhUip- 
pines believes in internationalism and interdependence with otner 
countries. On this score, President Marcos told the American jour- 
nalist: "We cannot live alone, not like the United States whose 
domestic market makes it thrive without any export. On the con- 
trary, 85% of our trade is export, so we have to deal with the world. 

The Chief Executive also pointed out that the Philippines needs 
the technology of the West, and lauded Japan for giving the Philip- 
pines the technology it needs. 

8 JULY — Acting Foreign Minister Pacifico A. Castro led the 
PhUippine Delegation to the 18th ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting 
held in Kuala Lumpur, 8-9 July 1985. In his opening remarks, Minis- 
ter Castro said: 

"ASEAN, no doubt, has become a potent political force in our 
region and in the world. Its voice and its views are listened to in 
regional and international fora, by small as well as by great powers. 



436 Diplomatic Agenda of Philippine Presidents 



Its collective political diplomacy has managed to keep the region re- 
latively stable. It has earned the respect and cooperation of other 
nations on issues and problems it has espoused and sponsored that 
relate both to regional stability and international peace and security. 
The Kampuchean situation, the problem of Indochinese refugees and 
the North-South relationship, are few of the salient extra-ASEAN 
issues and problems around which we have built a solid foundation 
for successful collective action. 



"ASEAN's success in regional political cooperation, however, 
is externally induced. What could have happened, and what will 
Ivtppen to ASEAN cooperation if there are no Kampuchean and In- 
dochinese refugees? Could we have been as successful? Would we 
have been able to forge as successfully a united, and collective co- 
operative undertaking? Could we have relied on ASEAN's external 
^fc f °" """^ organic dynamism and resilience, rather than on 
me Shared perception of a common external threat or good? 

"There is no doubt at all that our collective political actions 
rum increased our understanding of each other, even if they have 
cann ,5""°'^ common external stimuli. However, this alone 
nro ^ " "f^ to build a stronger ASEAN. We

al projects. These arc but a few of the difficulties that confront us in 
our economic cooperation program. 

*"We are a little apprehensive about our role as guardian of 
ASEAN on its 18th year Eighteen is an age that presents some 
serious problems of guardianship. It is the age that displays with con- 
fidence all its attractive endowments, coy yet willing. It is the age of 
consent. And it is at this age when so many will come a-wooing. And 
we are apprehensive that the painstaking and wise guardianship of 
our predecessors in seeing ASEAN come of age without any unto- 
ward incident may be put to naught. However, we will do our best. 
Indeed, it might be appropriate now to consider the feasibility of 
giving ASEAN a personality of its own by accrediting it as observer 
in the United Nations and such other forums as the Non-Aligned 
Movement, the Organization of Islamic Conference and other inter- 
governmental organizations as may be deemed necessary. Thus, 
ASEAN will no longer be confined to the geographical limits of 
Southeast Asia but will acquire a new stature identical to those of 
other regional organizations in world politics. This, we respectfully 
submit, is a natural and logical direction that ASEAN is destined to 
follow if it is to pursue its vocation to help maintain international 
peace and security and contribute to overall programs of mankind. 

Acting Foreign Minister Castro also conveyed to Malaysian 
Prime Minister Mohammed Mahathir and the other delegates the 
fraternal greetings of President Marcos and the Filipino people. Mi- 
nister Castro likewise assured them that the Philippines remains fully 
firmly committed to the purposes, principles, objectives, programs 
and projects of ASEAN. He mentioned in particular the Kampuchean 
problem which he said the Philippines will support all initiatives in 
the search for a peaceful political solution as a means to bring about 
peace, stability and progress in Southeast Asia. 

9 JULY — The ASEAN Foreign Ministers concluded their two- 
day meeting with the signing of three agreements to help pave the 
way towards better intra-ASEAN cooperation. The agreements 
signed were the Protocol to Amend the Agreement on the Establish- 
ment of the ASEAN Secretariat, the Agreement on the Recognition 
of Domestic Driving Licenses in ASEAN Countries and the Agree- 
ment on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. 

At the conclusion of ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Kuala Lum- 
pur, Acting Foreign Minister Pacifico A. Castro stress that the Meet- 
ing served to lend renewed strength and vigor in ASEAN's continued 
search to fully realize its potentials. Minister Castro also reiterated 



438 Diplomatic Agenda of Philippine Presidents

ASEAN's efforts in regional cooperation. 

The 18th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting ended with the settlement 
of the Kampuchean conflict still hanging in the balance. A joint com- 
munique issued at the end of the Meeting rejected Vietnam's so- 
called proposals for a negotiated solution as "variations of Vietnam's 
well-known positions and pre-conditions that have not helped to 
settle the problem." The 35-page communique said the Ministers re- 
viewed the situation in Kampuchea and were deeply concerned about 
the threat posed to the peace and stabUity of Southeast Asia by Viet- 
nam s continued illegal occupation of Kampuchea. The Ministers also

forcement Act of 1985. now under consideration by Congress be- 
cause "this bill contravene the letter and spirit of the multi-fiber 
agreement and bilateral textile agreements." 

Minister Castro likewise said that ASEAN hoped the recent 
drop in the US prime rate would result in lower interest rates on

crease capital flow into the region.

The US House of Representatives recently reduced US$15 
million from the US$195 million recommended by the Reagan ad- 
ministration as economic and military aid to the Philippine for 1986. 
The decision included the reduction of military aid to the Philippines 
from the requested US$100 million to US$25 million, and the 
increase of the proposed economic aid from US$95 million to 
US$155 million. The Philippine Government contended that this 
was a violation of the 1983 amendment to the bases pact under 
which the US Government committed to pay the Philippines US$900 
million over a five-year period from 1985 to 1989 for the use of 
Subic Naval Base in Zambales and Clark Air Base in Angeles City.

wawi, political security and economic adviser to Sultan Qaboos Bin 
Said of Oman, who called to pay his respects. During the call, the

Reagan considers that "a deal is a deal" and will abide by his com- 
mitment to push through in the US Congress the US$900-million 
security assistance to the Philippines.

worth said the current debate in the US Congress over economic, po- 
litical and military reforms in the Philippines will not in any way 
influence Reagan's resolve to see that the full amount is paid. Stres- 
sing that the US is not imposing these reforms as conditions for as- 
sistance, Bosworth said the "executive branch considers that it is 
m the US interest to provide assistance which is committed on a 
best effort basis."

Dranch of the US Government wUl, during the five fiscal years be- 
gmrung 1 October 1984, make its best effort to obtain appropriation

General Mikhail Gorbachev and President Andrei Gromyko, to the 
Supreme Soviet Presidium, and to the people and government of 
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 

"This generous gesture of friendship from the Soviet Union 
is of more than passing meaning to this moment of rededication 
in our country to the cause of peace, security and progress, 

"It encourages us to hope that other nations will truly respect 
our national sovereignty and independence and not aspire to inter- 
vene in the mistaken belief that we are vulnerable and weak, oeing 
a relatively small nation. 

"And it helps to see in perspective the peace o'^f^^f "^"f 
situation in our country, particularly development-wise, that ma^^^^ 
fests our capability to keep order and civility in our social life ana w 
safeguard democratic processes in our land. "
