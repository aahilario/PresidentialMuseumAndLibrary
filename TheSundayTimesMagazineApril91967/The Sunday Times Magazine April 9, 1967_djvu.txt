A mini debate 
on the skirt 

In publishing those arti- 
cles on Knees <STM, Mar, 
12) were you aware that 
knees are joints and the 
least interesting of the fe- 
male outposts? 

GALLARDO

Quezon City. 



I think women who dis 
play their knees are crazy. 
If their intention is to at- 
tract the opposite sex or 
simply to go along with 
modern styles, why then do 
they cover their knees when 
sitting in public conveyan- 
ces? It is disgusting to see 
a girl trying to pull her 
skirt to cover her exposed 
knees and thighs when in 
fact she can't. If she is 
ashamed that so many eyes 
are focused upon her ( then 
she is a fool for wearing 
that kind of clothes in the 
first place, 

EDDIE BARAZON

The mini-skirt is very 
much in vogue. A fashion- 
conscious girl will seem to 
be behind the times if she 
does not put on one. Thus, 
in the name of social ap- 
proval are revealed un- 
shapely legs, their unsight- 
lines 5 accentuated by those 
pairs of knees.., Imitation 
has always been a part of 
our lives. To avoid other 
people's scorn, we try to 
win their approval by fol- 
lowing their examples. The

higher-ups in the social 
strata are the first to fol- 
low the fad: then everybody 
rushes to her seamstress for 
one regardless of her moral 
values or the fad's practi- 
cability.,. The Filipino wom- 
an can adopt modern ways 
without totally relinquish- 
ing the ideals of Filipino 
womanhood. Nobody then 
would be justified in com- 
paring the Filipino woman

It is gratifying to know 
from Jean Pope's article 
(STM F March 12) that there 
are stilt humanitarians who 
deeply care for the handi- 
capped. N3edles s to say, 
there are a sizeable number 
of desperate and disabled 
Filipinos who simply fritter ! 
away their time. If the 
philanthropic agencies could 
further initiate and inspire 
these unfortunate people, 
that as men they must de-

EC EMBER 8, 1941 was o sunny day in 
Mindanao, more particularly in the municipa- 
lity of Misamis (now Ozamiz City), Misamis 
Occidental, where people were in a festive 
mood. It was the feast of the Immaculate 
Conception and the people were celebrating 
the town fiesta. 



Amidst the gaiety, came 
the shocking news that 
Pearl Harbor, as well as 
Davao, was .bombed; that 
Japanese warships were off 
Lingayen and that Clark 
Field was completely wiped 
out. The pecple, not only al 
Ozamiz City, but most 
everywhere in Mindanao 
then realized that, the Phil- 
ippines was actually involv- 
ed in a full scale war. They 
started storing up food pro- 
visions in the expectation 
that T with America on our 
side, the Japanese would be 
routed in due time. As the 
war mcnths rushed by, 
with radio San Francisco 
and the Voice of Freedom 



frcm Corregidor giving as- 
surances of the coming of 
American aid, the people 
continued to entertain the 
belief that it would not be 
long before the Japanese 
warlords would be driven 
out of the country. 

Sometime in early 1942, 
the people of, Orcquiera, 
capital town of Misamis Oc- 
cidental, were awakened 
one early morning by the 
roaring sound of a FT boat 
which landed at the wharf 
bearing President N&na Mrs. 
Quezon, Vice-President Os-^ 
mena and other high-rank- * 
ing officials, all looking ^ 
haggard and tired. From the 
wharf, they proceeded to 



the Catholic Church at 
town plaza where thi 
heard mass. The towns; 
pie subsequently leai 
that President Quezon 
party had been evacuai 
from Bukidnon to Australi 
Sometime in March, 1! 
news spread that Gene; 
MacArthur and his si 
liad arrived, too, in thi 
PT boats at Cagayan d| 
Oro City f on their way tq 
Del Monte f Bukidncn, fon 
evacuation to Australia, 

These fast-moving events 
made the pecple realize that 
the war in the Philippines] 
might be a prolonged strug-1 
gte notwithstanding the 
promise of American aidfl 
Most of the provinces, es-^ ' 
pecially in northern Minda-| 
nao, were still free from] 
Japanese occupation and| 
people had access to radio 
broadcasts coming from 
Corregidor and San Fran-! 
cisco. They knew that the: 
Philippine and America nj 
forces had been concentra-; 
ted in the Bataan Peninsula 
and in Corregidor, In these' 
two bastions, the people still 
believed that our forces 
could hold out until the pro- 
mised American aid would 
arrive. As days rolled by, 
however, and news of rever- 
ses of our forces was heard, 
the people began to enter- 
tain doubts about the even- 
ual outcome of the war.

These worms settle down in the liver, Jungs, intestines and other vi-

TWENTY FIVE YEARS, or o quar~ 
ter of a century, have passed 
since the Fail of Bataan on April 9, 
1942. This constitutes enough time to 
look back at it, perhaps not yet from 
a completely detached point of view, 
but from one that is less emotional, 
less angry. 

We know now, as we knew then, that it 
was not Robert Taylor and Hollywood who 
held Bataan for three months singlehandedly. 
There were far more Filipinos there than 
Americans. But presumably 1 'Bataan/' which 
starred Mr. Taylbr, was based on scant his- 
torical accounts and was filmed more for 
American consumption. 

But we know now, as we hardly knew 
then, that the XJSAFFE forces were not out- 
numbered ten to one — impossible odds which 
S'ome people still believe existed (It was men- 
tioned recently in a short movie documentary 
on Mac Arthur produced by US1S). This is 
not to discredit in any way the defenders of 
Bataan, History will forever recognize their 
legendary valor and gallantry and the coun- 
try will always be prbud of them. But offi- 
cial records in Washington, D.C. (contained 
in a book entitled "United States Army in 
World War H* 1 ) reports that the Japanese 
fielded two divisions, with supporting tank, 
artillery and engineer units, against the 
USAFFE's nine divisions. Since a Japanese 
division was at least twice the numerical 
strength of the XJSAF FE 's, the bdds slightly 
favored the USAFFE, as far as the infantry 
was concerned. What spelled victory finally 
for the Japanese was their air and sea super- 
iority and their battle readiness. 

There are other historical facts that we 
do not know enough of. And the most high- 
ly significant facts seem to be the events 
that led to the Japanese attack on Peari Har- 
bor, A more analytical evaluation of these 
events would make us understand better why 
the battle of Bataan was fought. 

The Military in Japan 

The ascendency of the military in Japan, 
of course, had a great deal to do with the 
aggressive policies of the country. The ascen- 
dancy was made possible by Japan's peculiar 
national structure since the time of the Meiji 
restoration of 1868. 



BATAAN 
THE GLARE 
OF HISTORY 



i By RODOLFO G. TUPAS 



Before Pearl Harbor, the China question 
was the primary concern of the Japanese 
government. The Japanese Army tried very 
hard by resorting to intrigues to drag the 
government into a military alliance with 
Germany, aimed against England, Franca 
and the Soviet Union, The pro-Axis feeling ran 
very high among the Japanese military. The 
Yonal cabinet opposed this and in fact tried 
to improve its relations with Great Britain 
and the U.S (Tosh?kazu Kase: "Journey to the 
Missouri/' Yale University Press, 1950) and 
this led to its fall, a fall that was engineered 
by the Army. 

Then the second Konoye cabinet emerged 
and consumated an alliance with Germany. 
Konoye, however, avoided a clash with the 
British and the Americans. Tojo became war 
minister and Matsuoaka foreign minister. 
Matsuoka succeeded concluding a neutrality 
pact with the Soviet Union in April, 1941 
but this was shattered when Germany attacked 
the Soviet Unibn in June, 1941. Since the 
Soviet Union shifted sides from the Axis to 
the democratic camp, Konoye feared his coun- 
try might be involved in the European war 
and thus began energetic negotiations with 
the U.S. 

When Konoye, however, wanted to offer 
concession to the U.S. with regard to the with- 
drawal of troops from China, General Tojo t 
representing the army, forced him out of l 
office.. With Tojo as prime minister, Japan 
embarked on preparations for war that led 
eventually to the assault on Pearl Harbor* 

By September, 1941, the Japanese Supreme 
Command decided to obtain its demands 
through negotiations with the U.S. and Great 
Britain, exhausting all diplomatic means for 
this purpose but in case the negotiations broke 
down, to prepare for war against the U.S. The 
Emperor of Japan strongly objected and forced 
the Supreme Command to give diplomatic 
negotiations precedence over preparations for 
war. 

When Germany attacked the Soviet Union, 
the Army became uneasy and Konoye, in enter 
to prevent the Army from taking any hasty 
action, agreed to a dispatch of troops to 
southern French Indochina in July. The U.S. 
retaliated by freezing Japanese assets in 
America. This was tantamount to the severing 
Of economic relations. And negotiations were 
suspended. 

While Japan decided on a policy of non- 
intervention in the SovfetrGerinan war, it 
simultaneously pursued an active policy of 
expanding into Thailand and French Indo- 
china for the sake of "self-existence and 



self-defense" and "even at the ri£Jt of an 
armed conflict with Great Britain and the 
United States ' 

When the U.S., Great Britain, and the 
Netherlands froze Japanese assets on July 26, 
1941 this meant economic isolation for Japan, 
By coincidence, on the very same day, the' 
U.S. government announced that it had estab- 
lished military headquarters in Manila under 
General MacArthur. 

Negotiations break down 

When General Tojo became prime minis- 
ter, he installed Togo as foreign minister. 
Tojo at one time declared: "The practice of 
European, powers checkmating one Oriental 
power against the other must be stopped." 

Events moved fast under the Tojo regime. 
In early December, a New York periodical, 
"Corftemporary China," noted: "Japan is on 
the verge of economic collapse with the costs 
of 5 years of war equalling the total expend- 
itures of the preceding century." 

Even by November, 1941, peace seemed 
improbable and the note of Cordeil Hull 
Seemed to have made conciliation impossible. 
On November 26, the Hull note asked the 
Japanese to withdraw its military forces from 
China and Indochina, a virtual nullification of 
the Tripartite Pact and the conclusion of a 
multilateral nonaggression pact among seven 
powers. 

On December 4, Roosevelt asked Japan to 
explain why land, air and naval forces were 
being sent to Indochina in numbers far exceed- 
ing Tokyo's treaty with the Vichy government. 
A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in 
Thailand replied: "Japanese troops have never 
crossed the Thailand border, and there definite- 
ly will be no crossing." 

When the Japanese finally assualted Pearl 
Harbor, Special Ambassadors Kurusu and 
Nomoura were still calling upon Secretary 
of State Cordeil Hull. 

"A day of infamy" 

Roosevelt called the assault on P€ 
Harbor "a day of infamy." But at this junctu 
many interesting and startling points in 
tory have come up. 

On December 16, 1941, Roosevelt ordered 
an investigation of the Pearl Harbor incident 
and subsequently the Robert's Commissibn 
was formed. The Roberts Commission, later 
accounts reveal, was not conducted in a sat- 
isfactory manner and denied the two men in 
command at Pearl Harbor, Admiral Husband

THE SUNDAY TIMES MAGAZINE APRIL 9, 1967 




Kimmel and General Walter Short, the oppor- 
tunity to confront witnesses or submit evi- 
dence. Each witness was told by the commis- 
sion that his testimony was secret. Under the 
claim that it was a fact-finding body, the Com- 
mission never formally charged Kimmel and 
Short with dereliction of duty or errors of 
judgment and yet it pinned the blame of 
neglect on them. 

In 1944, the Navy Court of Inquiry, as a 
result of a Congressional directive, was con- 
vened and Admiral Kimmel was afforded the 
traditional right to have counsel, to present 
witnesses and to cross-examine witnesses. 

The findings of the Naval Court complete- 
ly vindicated Admiral Kimmel and discovered 
'vitally important evidence as to the responsi- 
bility for the Pearl Harbor tragedy. An Army 
Board of Investigation similarly vindicated 
General Short. 

The Naval Court showed that vital inform- 
ation about Japanese plans and ship move- 
ments were withheld from the men in com- 
mand of Pearl Harbor prior to the attack. 



The findings of the Army and Naval 
courts pointed, to responsibility for the Pearl 
Harbor traged^ at Washington, D.C, 

On November 19, 1941, investigations 
showed the Japanese government set up a sys- 
tem for informing its men throughout the 
world of the time when Japan was to sever 
diplomatic relations or go to war with the 
U.S., Great Britain or Russia. This would be 
transmitted through a false weather broadcast 
from Japan. The words "east wind rain 1 * in 
the broadcast meant that Japan would sever 
relations or go to war with the XLS, 

Responsibility points to Washington, D.C. 

Interception of this message consequently 
by the U.S. Navy Department was of supreme 
importance. The Naval Court of Inquiry found 
that on December 4, the Navy Department in- 
tercepted and decoded such a message. This 
information was never transmitted to Kimmel 
or Short in Pearl Harbor, 



On December 6 and 7, the Navy Depart- 
ment intercepted and decoded other messages 
instructing the Japanese envoys for delivery 
of a Japanese ultimatum and the probable 
outbreak Of hostilities. The Intercepted mess- 
age was delivered to Roosevelt and still the 
Pearl Harbor Commanders were not provided 
with this information. 

An astounding discovery of the Naval 
Court was that General George Marshall dis- 
patched a warning belatedly at 11:52 sum. 
Washington time (6:22 a,m„ Pearl Harbor 
time) on Sunday, December 7 in a non-prior- 
ity status by commercial circuit! This is un- 
usual considering that Marshall had on his 
desk a telephone with a direct connection to 
the headquarters to the commanding general 
in Hawaii! 

Admiral Kimmel, breaking his silence in 
1954 ("Admiral Kimmers Story ** Henry Reg- 
nery Company) wrote: "The two prime agen- 
cies responsible for keeping the field com- 
manders informed and giving them orders 
were the War Department and the Navy De- 
partment. These two agencies were responsible 
only to the President of the United States. 
It is impossible to believe that both these 
agencies of such proved reliability and com- 
petence should simultaneously and repeatedly 
fail in such a crisis/' 

There were bther revealing facts brought 
up in subsequent Joint Congressional Commit- 
tee findings. Among them was the diary of 
Secretary of War Henry Stimson. His state- 
ments make very interesting reading: 

"If war did come, it was important both 
from the point of view of unified suppbrt of 
our own people as well as for the record of 
history, that we should not be placed in the 
position bf firing the first shot, if this could 
be done without sacrificing our safety, but 
that Japan should appear in her true role 
as the real aggressor/ ' 

One of the developments that might have 
induced Japan to fire her first shot was 
America's commitment to supply armed sup- 
port tb Britain. 

Again, Mr. Stimson declared: "In spite of 
the risks involved, in letting the Japanese Are 
the first shot, we realized that in order to 
have the full support of the American people 
it was desirable to make sure the Japanese 
be the ones, so that there remain no doubt 
in anyone's mind as to who were the ag- 
gressors/' 

In 1944, Oliver Lyttelton, British Minister 
of Production, made a scathing statement: "It 
is a travestry of history to say that Ameri- 
ca was forced into the war/* 

Admiral Kimmel himself said: (1 If those in 
authority wished to engage in power policies, 
the least that they should have done was to 
advise their naval military commanders what 
they were endeavoring to accomplish. To uti- 
lize the Pacific Fleet and the Army forces 
at Pearl Harbor as a lure for a Japanese 
attack without advising the commander-in- 
chief of the fleet and the commander of the 
Army base in Hawaii is something I am 
wholly unable to comprehend/* 

With all these historical accounts now be- 
ing unearthed, many questions are being rais- 
ed. Undoubtedly the Japanese military in Jap- 
an^had imperialist and aggressive designs on 
Southeast Asia. • But, 100 years from now, 
how will historians evaluate the infamy at 
Pearl Harbor? 

The defenders of Bataan will forever be 
true heroes and they have valiantly demon- 
strated how Filipinos react against foreigners 
who invade our shores. But it is becoming 
more and more apparent that our 1896 strug- 
gle for independence was the highest point of 
our history.

The Art of Espionage 

14W7 AR i s cruel, but to 
W lead a nation to war 
without knowing fully about 
the enemy is even more 
cruel. So know thine cwn 
strength and know thino 
opponent's and in every en- 
counter thou shalt emerge 
victoricus! M 

That was a voice from the 
fifth century B.C. — the 
voice of the great Sun-tze, 
the Chinese sage of strategy, 
whose classic book on the 
art of war is even now be- 
ing discussed in modern mi- 
litary academies. 
rpHE great Sun-tze class- 
J. ified spies under these 
five categories: 1) native 
spies; 2) inside spies; 3) 
spies in reverse; 4) dumb 
spies; and 5) daring spies. 

What are the so-called 
"native spies"? We are told 
they are the people of a 
country which is about to 
be conquered/ or already 
conquered in part or in 
whole, which another coun- 
try succeeds in winning to 
its side by good, special 
treatment accorded them, 
or who were moved by that 
other country's sympathy 
for their unfulfilled aspira- 
tions or grievances, (In our 
own times we call these 
"fifth columnists,") 

What are the so-called 
"inside spies"? Thev are 
men of importance within 
the enemy ranks who are on 
the inside of things, and 
who are able to give most 
valuable information won 
by their greed to accept 
the tempting bribes offered 
them. 

What are the so-called 
"spies in reverse"? They 
are agents sent by the en- 
emy to spy on you, and you 
— having learned of their 
real status — let them un- 
knowingly carry back fake 
or untrue information which 
would very likely mislead 
the enemy in his plans. 

What are the so-called 
"dumb spies"? They are 
real dumb persons to whom 
you feed sundry misleading 
information, then have them 
sent as spies into enemy 
territory. 

What are the so-called 
"daring spies"? They are 
resourceful persons whom 
ycu send into enemy terri- 
tory with specific missions: 
to convince the enemy with 
some false information or 
to perform sundry danger- 
ous assignments. (Today we 
would call these "propagan- 
dists" or "saboteurs").

the USAFFE troops because the latter con-

is not possible to state definitely the strength 
of Hie Philippine Army by mid-December 
1941, an estimate of the number of Filipims 
available for combat can be made. On the 
basis of the authorized strength of a Philip- 
pine division (7,500 men), the total divisional 
strength of the Philippine Army would-be 
75 000 men. To this figure must be added 
the strength of the 1st Regular Division, a 
part of the regular establishment, and the 
Constabulary, plus nondivisional and pro vis 
ional units formed after the start of the 
war A rough estimate of the number of men 
in the Philippine Army, therefore, would be 
approximately 120,000, a figure which is con- 
firmed by later reports on the number of 
men surrendered and by postwar claims for 
backpay and pensions." 

According to the book, the Japanese m- 
vadine force belonged to the Southern Army 
of the Japanese Imperial Army. The Southern 
consisted of the 16th Army, 25th Army, 
3rd Air Group, 5th Air Group and the 21st 
fndependent Air Unit. To the 14th Army, con- 
sisting of the 16th and 48th Divisions and the 
65th Brigade, was assigned the task of taking 
the Philippines. 

The Japanese originally planned to assign 
to the Philippine campaign six battalions for 
the advance landings, two full divisions for 
the main landings, and supporting troops. So 
meager were the forces available to Southern 
Army that General Masaharu Homma was fi- 
nally alloted for the entire operation only 2 di- 
visions the 16th and 48th, and the supporting 
troops. Once Luzon had been secured, most 
of the air units and the 48th Division, as 
well as other units, were to be transferred 
to the Indies and Malaya. At that time Horn 
ma would receive the 65th Brigade to mop 
up remaining resistance and to garrison Lu- 
zon. The 16th Division would then move south 
and occupy the Visayas and Mindanao. 

Homma had also counted on having the 
support of a joint Army and Navy air force 
of 600 planes. But one of the two air brig- 
ades of the 5th Air Group and some of the 
naval air units originally destined for the 
Philippines were transferred to other opera 
tions. The addition of the 24th Air Regv 
ment to the 5th Air Group at the last mo 
ment brought the combined air and nival 
strength committed to the Philippine cam 
paign to about 500 combat aircraft 

Initial skirmish 

In the early morning of December 10, two 
task forces of. the 14th Army of the 
Japanese Imperial Army, each of 2,000 men 
known as the Kanno and Tanaka detachments 
landed at Vigan, Hocos Sur, and Aparri and? 
Gonzaga. In Cagayan. 

The Tanaka detachment went ashore 
Aparri and Gonzaga t meeting no resistance 

On the same day the Japanese Air Force 
bombed Nielson and Nichols airfields, th" 
16th naval base in Cavite and Sangley Point, 
Clark Field in Fampanga, and Manila. It was 
a dfsaster to the US Navy and the USAFFJ 
Air Force, and Admiral Thomas Hart, com 
mander of US Asiatic Fleet, was forced 
withdraw the fleet from Philippine waters an< 
proceeded to Dutch East Indies. J 

In the morning of December 12, the Jap 
anese Kimura detachment of 2,500 men Ian*

The Kanno detachment at Vigan then 
split into two columns: one moved north to 
r capture Laoag, Iloeos Norte, and the others 
raced southward. 

On December 18 Gen, Brougher sent a 
patrol to meet the Kanno detachment at Ta- 
gudin. Ilocos Sur. There was a light skrmish, 
after which the patrol rejoined the 12th and

badly mauled and withdrew. 

Gen, Wainwright immediately threw the 
71st Division into action to give help to the 
battered 11th Division. In the same breath 
he sent the 26th Cavalry (Philippine Scouts) 
tc La Union to protect the beaches there and 
also to reenforee the 11th. But only the 71st 
Infantry Regiment of the 71st Division (which 
was now bivouacked at Urdaneta, Pangasinanj 
could be moved on time. Nevertheless, it 
reached the 11th Division and, side by side, 
the two engaged the enemy. But on Decem-

Ihe 11th Division and the 71st Inf. Regi- 
ment were caught flat-footed and had to re- 
deploy, reforming their defense line from Ba- 
uang to San Fernando, La Union. 

26th ambushed 

Then the battle began. This time in earn 
est. Against a well-trained enemy that was 
supported by bomber planes and tanks the 
11th Division and the 71st Inf, Regiment 
stood their ground — until reinforcements 
would arrive. Furiously, they fought the Jap- 
anese, and equally the Japanese pounded at 
the defenders. Meanwhile, the 26th Cavalry 
was entering La Union when it was sudden- 
ly ambushed at Bu-ed River, near Rosario, by 
a reconnaissance patrol of the Japanese. Phil- 
ippine Scouts in their horses were sitting 
ducks before the awaiting sights of the ene- 
my's rifles and machine guns. One by one 
they fell from their horses— after which pan- 
ic ensued among the survivors. Horses with 
guns still intact in their holsters stampeded

back to Fangaslnan in different directions. 
Gen, Shelleek, whose orders the 26th was 
taking, was reported to have called down 
Colonel Clinton A. Pearce, the 26th's com- 
mander; Shelleck was said to have been Irk- 
ed by the 26th 's delay m covering the Bued 
River to prevent the enemy from crossing it. 
By the time the 26th reached the vicinity of 
the river, the Japanese had already crossed 
it and had laid the ambush. 

Determined to lend succor to the beleag- 
uered units in the Bauang-San Fernando area, 
Gen. Shelleck tried to send the remaining 
72nd Inf. Regiment, but it was too late: the 
11th Division and 71st Inf. Regiment were 
rough] y beaten by the enemy and had to re- 
treat to Baguio City via the NaguUian Road. 
In the city, the 1st battalion of the 71st 
Regiment under the command of CoL Guiller- 
ma Nakar, In a rear guard action, put up a 
fight against the Japanese that were in hot 
pursuit. Meanwhile, the 26th's survivors re- 
grouped and, together with the 72nd Regi- 
ment, engaged the enemy again at Rosarlo, 
to buy time for the 11th Division and the 
two battalions of the 71st Regiment to race 
down the Kennon road to Fangasinan* The 
escaping forces finally made it to Fangasi- 
nan, near the Binalonan-ITrdaneta area, minus 
the 1st battalion of the 71st Regiment under 
Nakar which could not anymore pass through 
Rosarlo which the 26th and the 72nd Regi- 
ment had abandoned following the dash made 
by the 11 th and the two battalions. 

Rout 

When Rosario fell, the 26th and the 72nd 
Regiment and the two battalions of the 71st 
Regiment dug in at the Sison-Binalonan area. 
Flushed by their success, the Japanese 42nd 
Division rolled on, then struck hard at the 
defenders with all they had —tanks, planes 
and giant artillery pieces. The 26th was rout* 
ed, this time with only a handful of men 



left. The 71st and 72nd Regiments desperate- 
ly held their ground, losing heavy casualties 
in day-and-night pitch battles. A soldier from 
the waray-waray provinces who was a mem- 
ber of one of the two battalions left of the 
71st Regiment died a hero's death, but not 
in vain. He was said to have blasted an ap- 
proaching enemy tank single-handedly with 
grenades until he was mowed down by mach- 
ine gunfire. 

The Japanese relentlessly drove on, until 
the defenders were forced to retreat to Po- 
zoirubio, a riee-land town. Here, one morn- 
ing, American tanks deployed on the sides 
of the national highway beneath some bam- 
boo clumps were caught by surprise when 
three Japanese bombers suddenly hove into 
view and began strafing and bombing them. 
Hie planes freely did their worst as there 
was not a single TJ3AFFE plane to fight 
them. They made several bombing runs, and 
in less than 20 minutes all of the tanks 
were blown to bits. 

By 5:O0 in the afternoon, there was sud- 
den alarm: the defenders' lines were again 
broken: the call for general retreat was 
sounded. Squads by squads, platoons by pla- 
toons, soldiers jumped into waiting buses 
which had earlier been commandeered by the 
USAFF E f and drove off. The roads were soon 
filled with high-balling buses, and in the 
gloam, one could see the pitiful convoy of a 
retreating force down the highways leaving 
in their wake swirling clouds of dust and a 
blood-colored horizon in the distance. 

"This is the worst rout I've ever seen in 
any life," said one officer. * 'There's nothing 
like it" 

Second delaying action 

The 71st and 72nd Regiments and the 
71st Division command post withdrew to Bi- 
nalonan, but at about one in the morning of 
the following day, left posthaste when the

ed through this line, and the 
three divisions withdrew to 
form another defense line

Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija.

this time in full force, but luckily, it manag- 
ed to repulse the enemy. However, it sus- 
tained h-aavy casualties. Then, more enemy 
bombardments, and the Philippine Scouts were 
forced to withdraw to Abucay town. Only 
with reinforcements from the 21st Division, 
then in II Corps reserve force, saved the 
57th's crumbling line, 

Sgt. Delfin R. Ylanan, who was there with 
the 57th, now 55, an American citizen, and 
receiving a monthly pension of $291, recalled: 

"I was with the I Company, and we fought 
everywhere in our sector, at night, by day, 
In the rice paddies, in the beaches, in the 
fishponds bounded by mangroves. But tanks 
and planes made us a push-over to the ene- 
my. When they pierced our lines we fell 
back to Abucay, where we re-grouped. I saw 
only 16 of my companions, and we were 
about 120 in the company, 

"Later, I came to know from reports that 
our First Sergeant was hanged in a tree by 
the Japanese when we withdrew/' 

Unable to wreak havoc on the 57th, the 
Japanese then started to probe the line of 
the 41st f and on January 10-1 l t one of the 
most sa vage fightings in the Bataan campaign 
took place. The 41st t ably commanded by 
Gen. Lim, a West Pointer, exchanged punches 
with the enemy in see-saw battles that oc- 
curred hour after hour. Under the blistering 
counter-attacks of the 41st, the Japanese 
reeled back. 

Smarting from the blows, the Japanese 
then probed westward and stumbled upon a 
weak point in the Abucay line, the boundary 
between the 41st and 51st. The Japanese took 
advantage of this, and on January 14, launch- 
ed an attack. Threatened were the friendly 
units in the rear areas, and the possibility 
of the front-line troops being cut off from 
them loomed. 

Battle of the "Points" 

To keep the defenders busy, Gen. Homma 
mounted landing operations on the west coast 
of Bataan in a bold action to trap the I 
Corps. 

In the early morning of January 23, Jap- 
anese units landed at the Lapiay-Lonoskawa- 
yan Points near Mariveles, believing they 
hsd landed at Caibobo Point near the rear of 
the left flank of tba I Corps line. They lost 
their bearings in the night. By January 29, 
their party of 300 men was wiped out to 
the last man. Pinning them to their death 
on the white beaches were the rifle-equipped 
US Air Force whose planes were nowhere to 
be found, the US Naval Battalion in Marive- 
les, the 2nd Anti-Tank Battalion, all receiving 
orders from Gen. Shelleck, and the 57th. 

But when the Japanese landed again, they 
were in much bigger size. This was at Qui- 
nauan and Anyasan-Silanm Points. Under th3 
cloak of night, they came ashore on barges, 
but before a few of them landed powerful 
searchlights were turned on them, and artille- 
ry guns opened fire on them. The artillery 
pieces scored several direct hits, turning the 
loaded barges into small infernos of fire and 
sending unscathed soldiers splashing into th- 
water. The landing was a complete disaster. 
Many Japanese soldiers were able to land and

rides 3.5 Kms. on only 1£ worth of gas . . . gets 
90 kms. per litre. Yet costs only little more than 
a bicycle. 

Consider how easy it is to operate. Can you 

nde a bicycle? Then you can ride a P-50. To 
start it you just push a lever, pedal a little, release 
the lever. No clutch, no gears. 

Consider these standout features, too: 

reliable 50cc, 4 -stroke. OHC engine means no 
oil mixing or messy exhaust - - burns straight 
gasoline; one touch control on handlebar means 
carefree driving; super -efficient muffler and quiet 
engine assures comfortable riding; sturdy frame

Consider everything but repair and mainte-

CORREGIDOR 

By BERNARDO J. DAROY 



a LL OF TWENTY-SEVEN DAYS, and in all 
* ime Corregidor 'The Rock" was 
subjected to the most intensive artillery bom- 
bardment ever witnessed. The shelling began 
the day Bataan fell, April 9, 1942 and was 
kept up until May 6. 



Wrote General Jonathan 
Wainwright: 4 \„We estimat- 
ed that the Japanese had 
hit the Rock with 1,800,000 
pounds cf shells," This was 
in addition to the bombs 
dropped by the Japanese 
aircraft. 

The bombardment was so 
intense that a Philippine 
Scent officer wrote later: 
"One day's shelling did 
mere damage than all the 
bombings put together," The 
aircraft bombing, he fur- 
ther wrote, "paled into in- 
significance" besides the 
massive artillery bombard- 
ment, Corregidor was shell- 
ed from Bataan and from 
Cavite. 

The first shelling came 
from the Japanese battery 
at Cabcaben, the point on 
Bataan nearest Corregidor. 
It was, ' however, answered 
by the 155-mm gun s of the 
battery cn the North Shore 
of Corregidor. 

Wrote a Philippine Scout 
who was assigned with Bat- 
tery Kysor on the North 
Shore: * "We could see the 
guns and their crew from 
where we stood and we 
fired at them successfully." 

At the same time, the 
Japanese balloon company 
moved from Abucay to the 
height s of Mariveles where 
the Japs could observe fire 
cn Corregidor. At the first 
sight of the balloon, the Am- 
ericans christened it "Peep- 
ing Tom," 

By April 12 the bombard- 
ment of Corregidor began 
in earnest. Most of the 
fire came from 75-mm and 
105-mm guns. On that day 
the batteries on Cavite 
opened fire on the Rock. 
And the following week, 
Japanese 150-mm gun s join- 
ed the bombardment. 

At night, wrote a Filipi- 
no officer later, the Japa- 
nese did not neglect the 



searchlights. "Whenever one 
showed its light," he wrote, 
"the Japs quickly shot hell 
out of it" 



Guns on Corregidor 

Before the war, the For- 
tress Island was "Off Li- 
mits" to unauthorized per- 
sons. It was only after the 
war that the general public 
Knew about the formidable 
defenses of Corregidor, 

Its seacoast defenses alone 
consisted of 23 batteries. 
Ail together the Island had 
a total of 56 coastal guns 
and mcrtars, all of World 
War I vintage. The guns 
ranged in caliber from 
thtree-inch to 12-inch. The 
longest range cancn were 
the two 12-inch guns on Bat- 
tery H-arn, with a horizon- 
tal range of 29,000 yards. 
There were six 12-mch guns 
with a ranpe of 17,000 yards 
and ten mortars of the 
same caliber. 

There were also 19 155-mm 
guns capable of a range of 
17,000 yards. The anti-air- 
craft equipment consisted 
of 3-inch guns witi * a verti- 
cal range of 27,000 to 32 } 000 
feet, depending on the type 
of ammunition used. There 
also were several .50-caliber 
machineguns and 60-inch 
searchlights. 

Before the war, the gar- 
rison on Corregidor con- 
sisted primarily of the artil- 
lery, the headquarters and 
service troops not exceed- 
ing 6,000 men. There also 
were civilian^ in such har- 
ries as San Jose in the Bot- 
tomside. These civilians 
were mostly dependents of 
military personnel. They 
were later evacuated before 
the war began. 

After December 8, 1941, 
the population swelled ra- 



pidly. First came the survi- 
vors of the Cavite Naval 
base; then the service and 
headquarters troops from 
Manila. On Christmas Day, 
General MacArthur estab- 
lished his headquarters 
side the Malinta Tunnel. A 
Military Pclice Company, 
two ordnance companies, 
an engineer company and a 
service detachment moved 
in. Later, the 4th Marines 
evacuated Olongapo and 
transferred to Corregidor, 
swelling the population by 
more than 1,000 men. 

Also on Corregidor Island 
was the Philippine Army's 
First Coast Artillery Corps. 
{Some of the survivors are 
still with the Armed Forces 
of the Philippines, while 
other s are now in business 
and industry.) 

Tragedy and heroism 

During the seige of Cor- 
regidor, there were mo- 
ments of tragedy and he- 
roism. 

On April 15 some 70 Phil- 
ippine Scouts died a terri- 
ble death when they took 
shelter in excavations be- 
hind their battery ^ Wrote 
their Commanding Officer: 
"So intense was the enemy 
fire that the overhanging 
cliffs collapsed and sealed 
the entrances to the shel- 
ers, burying the men alive." 

On April 16 % four men of 
Battery B, 60th Coast Artil- 
lery, earned Silver Stars. 
The 100-foot flagpole on the 
Topside Parade Ground had 
been struck by an enemy 
shell. Wrote their Com- 
manding Officer: "Slowly, 
terribly, the flag began to 
descend. The four men left 
their shelter and ran to the 
parade ground during an 
intense bombardment. Be- 
fore the flag reached the 
ground, the men gathered 
the flag into their arms 
Quickly repairing the pole, 
they raised the flag and 
ran back to their shelter." 

The bombardment on the 
Rock reached a peak on 
April 29, Emperor Hirohl- 
to's birthday.

HOUSTON «UFI> — "Low

produced for the construction 
of a huge storage tank to hold 
anhydrous ammonia in lique- 
fied form— at 28 decrees below 
zero, 

Tfhe special steels required for

ston works of Armco Steel 
Corp.. are one of the first ap- 
plications this material has in 
structural shapes, 



At 7:30 in the morning, 
the air raid alarm was 
sounded. Two flights of 

Japanere bombers flew over 
Fort Hughes and three dive 
bombers hit the south deck 
and the entrances to Ma- 
linta Tunnel. At the same 
time, the keeping Tom" 
rose over Mariveles and 
artillery opened fire on the 
Bottcmside targets* 

Six more bombers con- 
centrated cn Malinta Tun- 
nel and artillery shells hit 
both the entrances to the 
Tunnel and on the North 
Dock, At about 10:00 o'clock 
in the morning, the Japan- 
ese shells hit two ammuni- 
tion dumps which blew up 
with tremendou s explos- 
ions. The attacks continued 
without letup in the after- 
noon. By night ,a large por- 
tion of the Island lay 
'Shrouded under a flense 
cloud of smoke and dust. 

Grass fire^ were burn- 
ing everywhere and ammu- 
nitions from the two dumps 
were still exploding. In- 
stallations on Malinta Hill 
were in shambles; observa- 
tion stations destroyed; and 
the power plant for the 
searchlights wa s , burned 
out. Many of the gun em- 
placements were demolish- 
ed. * 

Counterbattery from Cor- 
regidor were fired from 
Fort Drum and Fort Frank. 
But the 12-inch guns which 
could be used" against the 
Japs in Bataan were blan- 
keted with fires from the 
Cavite artillery. 

Inside the tunnel 

Malinta tunnel was the 
most extensive construc- 
tion on Corregidor. It con- 
sisted of the main east- 
west passage 1.400 feet long 
and 30 feet wide. The Tun- 
nel had 25 laterals, each 
400 feet long, branching out 
at regular intervals from 
each side of the main pas- 
sage. 

During the bombardment, 
I life on the Rock wem un- 
derground. Filipinos and 
Americans huddled against 
the boxes of food and am- 
munition along the sides. 
Inside the Tunnel were 
President Manuel Quezon 
and hi s staff.' Here also 
were General MacArthur 
and his staff. The main 
hospital wa s also housed in 
the Tunnel. 

Outside the Tunnel, the 
men encountered unusual 
and sometimes strange 
sights. President Quezon, 
sick and confined to a 
wheelchair, spent much of 
his time outside the Tun- 
nel. On December 30, 1941, 
a small group witnessed 
President Quezon's second 
inauguration in an impres- 




i 



sive ceremony. That was 
before the extensive bomb- 
ardment. 

The treasury of the Phil- 
ippines — gold, silver and 
securities — were also de- 
posited inside the Tunnel. 

During the intensive 
bombardment, life inside 
the Tunnel became unbear- 
able. Dust and dirt, great 
black flies and vermin 
were everywhere. The odor 
of the hospital and men's 
bodies rilled the place. 

When the b!ower s were 
shut off, the foul smell, and 
heat were almost unbear- 
able. And when the lights 
failed, total darkness en> 
veloped the gloomy Tun- 
nel. Said a Philippine Scout 
sergeant. "When the lights 
failed, we went out to 
snatch the sun. We would 
crowd at the entrances to 
breathe deeply the gasoline 

fume s and aust mat P ass " 
ed for fresh air/' 



Dice roll and jam sessions 

Wrote an American hos- 
pital attendant who came 
from Bataan: "Under the 
deepening shadow of death, 
life on Corregidor took on 
a faster, more intense tem- 
po. The smallest and the 
simplest pleasure became 
sought after and treasured 
as they became increasing- 
ly rare and dangerous— an 
uninterrupted cigarette, a 
cold shower, a stolen bis- 
cuit, a good nighty sleep in 
the open air,** 

She continued: "There 
was a heightened feeling 1 
that life was to be lived 
from day to day without 
illusions of an ultimate 
victory. Many sought for- 
get fulness in gambling, for 
there was no other way to 
spend the accumulated pay 
that bulged in their pockets. 
They rattled the dice, play- 
ed endless rummy, poker.

While the shells and 
bombs fell, jam sessions 
were held inside the Tunnel. 
Crowds gathered in the

"-They hummed softly or

talgic swing of an organ or

* A piece of cheese and CFB 

"For supper,'* said a 
Philippine Scout, "we had a 
sort of stew. It consisted 
t mainly of rice and two 
L pieces of bread and a little 
jHam or sugar to taste."* 
Ration on Corregidor dull- 
ing the last 27 days had 
been cut to, half. And there 
was more water than rice P 
the Scout said. 

Colonel Carlos Romulo in 
his "Voice of Freedom** 
ncted: u Sometimes we had 
a soggy slice of bread with 
our breakfast and some- 
times we had none/* 

CPR wrote: "When Pre- 
sident Quezon and General 
MaeArthur left for Austra- 
lia, the President left me a 
gift — a piece of cheese. 
For days I moved the cheese 
between my fingers. Then 
months later I decided to 
eat the cheese. So unfastid- 
ious can hunger make one 
that I ate the cheese after 
removing its small inhabit- 
ants," 

Bombardment before assault 

General Homma's orders 
re a d: "Overwhelmingly 
crush the island's defenses 
and exterminate its defend- 
ers." 

Thus at the beginning of 
May, the Japanese artillery 
and aircraft opened the 
final phase of the bombard- 
merit. By that time, all for- 
ces on the Island were 
ready and took position for 
the enemy's assaulL Re- 
maining guns, searchlights 
and pillboxes had been des- 
troyed. The defenders re- 
ceived their first hint of the 
Japanese landing plan on 
May 1. Artillery fire from 
Bataan was concentrated on 
the narrow trail of the is- 
land and on the area around 
James Ravine. These places 
provided a pathway from 
the beach to Topside, 

The shells began drop- 
ping before dawn and con- 
tinued until midnight. Bom- 
bers dropped their loads at - 
the entrances to the Malin- 
ta Tunnel, As a result 
much of the mess equip- 
ment, transportation and 
communications facilities 
were destroyed. 

The next day was even 
worse. The shelling started 
at 7:30 in the morning and 
kept on continuously. "There 
was a brief lull for 30 min- 
utes," wrote an American 
officer. That was sometime 
before noon. Then the bom- 
bardment resumed with 
more intense firing rate. 



Targets were Batteries 
Geary and Crockett where 
the big guns were still 
standing. "The rate of fire," 
wrote General Wainwright, 
"was 12 shells per minute of 
the 240-rnm Howitzers.** 

The bombardment on 
May 3 ( Sunday, was a repe- 
tition of the shelling of the 
day before. The planes 
concentrated on Kindley 
Field and Jame s Ravine. 
The antiaircraft guns on 
the Rock fired at the en- 
emy aircraft despite dam- 
age done to the guns and 
height finders. 

Reported General Wain- 
w right to General Mac- 
Arthur: "Situation here is 
fast becoming desperate. 
With artillery fire that out- 
ranges anything we have 
except two guns, the enemy 
keep s up a terrific bombard- 
ment as well as air bomb- 
ing." 

On May 4, the artillery 
bombardment reached a 
new peak. Japanese shell 
from Bataan that day was 
the heaviest of the cam- 
paign. It totaled more than 
16,000 shells of alf calibers 
during the 24-hour period. 

Wrote one officer; "So in- 
tense was the bombard- 
ment, so continuous the 
drumfire of bursting shells 
that it resembled machine 
gun fire in it s staccato re- 
gularity." 

From Topside observers 
saw 15 landing barges off 
the coast of Bataan, They 
were to pick up the assault 
troops at Lamao. Wrote an 
officer: "The ability of the 
Corregidor garrison to with- 
stand a Japanese assault 
after the continuous shelling 
was doubtful." 

On May 5. the Japanese 
pcured everything they had 
— from Bataan and from 
Cavite. The same officer 
wrote: "There was a steady 
roar from Bataan. And there 
wa& a mightier roar on 
Corregidor. A continuous 
pall of dust and debris 
hung over everything. There 
was a feeling of doom 
mingled with wonder/' 

The last day of the bom- 
bardment finished every- 
thing on Corregidor — guns, 
communications, supplies 
and even the morale of the 
defenders. 

But as the Japanese be- 
gan landing on the shores, 
a Philippine Scout machine- 
gunner kept pressing the 
trigger. He kept on and on. 
hitting what he could with- 
in range of his gun. And 
even after the surrender of 
the garrison, the Scout was 
still pressing his machine- 
gun's trigger until someone 
tapped him on the shoulder: 
**It is all over. . . They have 
surrendered." He answered: 
"Heck."

■ N LATE NOVEMBER, 1941, two is- 
I sues claimed the attention of Ma- 
nila's 600,000 population: the war in 
Europe, and the coming Christmas 
holidays. 

Of the two, it seemed the Yuietide Season 
was the more proximate, and engrossing- The 
war in Europe, with the threat of an expanded 
war front reaching the Far East, occupied most 
of page one of the newspapers, but the people 
viewed the tensions with less emotion that they 
did the more urgent, and pleasurable, matters 
of living. 

Air-raid drills and partial blackouts were not 
to be taken seriously until much later. Only the 
schools and government offices, it seemed, com- 
plied with air-raid drill instructions to the letter; 
in their homes, the people would sit tight or

would go on with their business nonchalantly 
while the sirens wailed. During blackouts ( a 
light would burn here and there. In this man- 
ner, one man, a Chinese, was fined F2Q.00 for 
not following the rules. 

The problems then would make any present- 
day reader smile in amusement, they were so 
like the ones that plague this generation. Strip- 
ped to their core, problems usually haye a uni- 
versal nature. The problems then, and now, 
differ only in intensity. 

In Customs, an appraiser was being fined 
the equivalent of one month's salary for ihisde- 
daring a shipment of pianos from Shanghai. The 
pianos, valued at F500, apiece, were appraised 
for "the scandalously low price," according to 
the Collector of Customs, of f50. each. 

In Malacanang, the President had given a 
speech that was causing "capital circles to fear 
an adverse effect on Fit-American relations." 
President Quezon, however % countered with re- 
affirming his loyalty to Roosevelt, and added 
that he had merely hit the "misinformation sent 
by theorists and pacifists and Civic Liberties 
Unions which gave the wrong impression of what 
we are trying to do here." 

Cavite City and Olongapo were suffering a 
rash of thieves. 

The Philippines faced a sugar quota deficit. 

The Manila Gas Corporation had applied to 
impose a surcharge of 15% on its services. 

Then, as now, the populace was decrying 
"prices gcing up everyday." An Assemblyman 
had suggested a 30% bonus in the salary of the 
government worker, a suggestion that was met 
by a barrage of praise, on one hand, and scorn 
on the other ("Nothing but promises and pro- 
paganda.") 



Manila at the outbreak 

THE 



These "high prices" the people were pro- 
testing consisted of the following range: n.50 for 
a permanent wave. 7 centavo s for "The Tri- 
bune", f21.00 monthly rent for an aceesoria in 
Libertad, J3.95 for a shock-proof Swiss-made 
wist watch, fl-25 for a set of Chinese checkers, 
rt9.95 for a five-unit electric train. In real es- 
tate, a 3-door row of apartments in Fasay sold 
for PI ,500. 

Because of the war rumors, the government 
was cracking down on profiteers. Newspaper 
editorials lambasted those who raised their price s 
in the wake of rumors. Two stallholders in th e 
Quinta market faced charges in the Manila 
Court of First Instance for selling tenderloin at 
F1.20 a kilo. The maximum price allowed by 
the anti-profiteering executive ordinance was 
n.OO a kilo. 

Civic-spiritedness was an issue then, as it is 
now. In the November elections, 1,000,000 of the 
3,000,000 electorate had not cast their ballots, 
and the usual outspoken circles were up in arms- 
against the apathetic citizens. 

Movies were popular. Huge advertisements 
in the newspapers were run for such classics as 
"Sgt. York/* starring Gary Cooper, and "The 
Adventures of Young Doctor Kildare," a more 
durable medico than was first apparent. The 
Sta. Ana Cabaret atttracted the usual crowds 
during weekends, the bcogie woogie and boomps- 
a-daisy were the rituals of the danceiloor, and 
everybody read Jane Arden, Prince Valiant, 
Buck Rogers, and Dorothy Dix. 

Nobody was building an air-raid shelter. 
Ironically, it was not till December 5 that Que- 
zon's cabinet made public the plan to build a 
huge air raid shelter costing P17,000,000- 

Stj ii etching rumors 

The unconcernedness of the populace over 
the war can be traced partly to the military, 
which wa s bent on squelching war rumors. As 
late as December 2, 1941, the USAFFE was de- 
nying rumors of an alert. "Rumors," said an 
aide de camp of Gen. MacArthur rather drily, 
which "tended to give the impression that war 
was just around the comer." The implication 
was, that it wasn't. Among I he rumors was that 
full war equipment, including gas masks and 
steel helmets, had been issued to Filipino soldiers 
of the Batangas divisions. 

However, while life wore on among a seem- 
ingly nonchalant people, the signs of an impend- 
ing emergency increased. 

First aid courses by the Philippine Red Cross 
went on throughout the city. On the third of 
December, the Red Cross pledged emergency 
hospital accommodations for 500 persons. 

The National Coconut Corporation under 
Dean Conrado Benitez eyed the introduction of 
coconut milk, in case the country ran short of 
imported natural milk. 

The Immigration Bureau became stricter 
with the visiting crew of foreign ships. Where- 
as the latter were allowed tb stay ashore in the 
city all day and night, they now had to be back 
at their ships by midnight. What is more, a US 



naval intelligence man was assigned to every 
boat that arrived in the country. 

The entrance of Manila Bay was mined. 
The heat was on on the local Japanese popu- 
lation. The fate of 23,000 Japanese in the Phil- 
ippines was being deliberated. As of 1941, the 
Japanese had invested F44 million in the Phil- 
ippines. The Japanese here consisted of bank- * 
crs. traders, newspapermen, and workers in the 
hemp plantations in Davao, 

When the US-Japan crisis began to look se- 
rious in November, 2,000 Japanese left the coun- 
try. In early December, another 500 were pre- 
paring to leave on the first Japanese vessel that 
would arrive. They never had the chance. When 
the war broke out, the Japanese nationals r ex- 
cluding the diplomats, were herded to concen- 
tration camps and special establishments that 
had been prepared for them. 

The US-Japan dialogue 

Official dispatches from Washington and 
Tokyo grew graver by the day as the first week 
of December unfolded.

of the war: 



UNPROVIDED CITY 



By JEAN POPE 



The US-Japan crisis (at that time, newspa- 
• pers used crisis between quotation marks) start- 
led in April, when President Roosevelt and the 
[ envoys started talks aimed at achieving "perma- 
nent peace in the Pacific.** In November, how- 
ever, the situation became grave, as it became 
apparent that the Americans an d the Japanese 
were poles apart in their thinking. 

In Tokyo, Foreign Minister Shigenori Togo 
was noting how "the United States and Great 
Eritain refuse to understand Japan's ideals and 
hamper Japan's attempts to create a new order 
in East Asia." The Americans charged that 
"Japanese policies' are based on force in every 
way— politically t socially, economically, moral- 
ly." At one point, Secretary of State Cordell 
Hull told the Japanese envoys that America tried 
to conduct her affairs with morality and equity, 
and handed them a document of the basic Am- 
erican principles! 

As for the two Japanese envoys in Washing- 
ton — Special Ambassador Saburo Kuruso and 
Ambassador Kichisaburo Nomura — they were 
hard put to dispatch their diplomatic functions 
in the face of increasing hostilities between the 



two countries. Nomura was quoted by the AP 
as saying that "Nobody wants war, which would 
not solve anything anyway/* 

As late as December 6 f when he handed to 
Roosevelt Japan's reply to the President's request 
for an explanation on why Japan had increased 
her troops in Indo China from 20,000 to 100 000, 
Nomura was saying it wa§ their hope that "ex- 
ploratory talks would continue." 

At the very moment Japanese planes were 
attacking Pearl Harbor, the Japanese embassy 
was asking for an appointment with Hull. When 
ihe two envoys gave a document to the elderly 
.Secretary of State (containing Japan's formula 
for peace in the Pacific), the latter read it, and 
said it was "so crowded with infamous false- 
hoods and distortions,** The envoys left. 

How little people seemed to be aware of the 
coming conflict! In Washington, an American 
adviser, former Minister to Thailand Hugh Grant, 
said that "the Japanese are past master s at 
bluffing/' Anyway, if worse came to worse, he 
believed "we could smash them within a tew 
months with our superior naval and air forces." 
Another senator felt sure Japan would quit the 



Axis and take her "natural place" among nations 
with peaceful interests in the Pacific. 

On December 8, Japanese planes bombed 
seven points in the Philippines, newspapers emo- 
tionally reported of the move to crush a "Japan 
that had run amuck in the Pacific," and the 
war was on. "Be calm, have faith," said Pres- 
ident Quezon from Baguio, "God has never for- 
saken our people." 

But it is a classic example of the inability of 
the people to grasp the full meaning of the war, 
a proof of the much- repeated statement thai Ihe 
consensus in Manila was that the war would end 
shortly, that the day after the war broke out, 
the following item appeared in the society page: 

"Three weddings made news yesterday. No- 
body seemed to be postponing their wedding be- 
cause of any mere war."

December 8th 
set off THE 

LONGEST 
VACATION 



MY INITIAL reaction to 
the outbreak of the 
war was perhaps typical of 
that of other school child- 
ren or teenage students 
throughout the land. We 
were about halfway through 
with our first class in the 
morning when the "extras" 
hit the streets of Manila 
(Intramuros, in my case) 
saying in the biggest head- 
line you ever saw that the 
Japs had bombed Pearl 
Harbor. For all the furor 
that it raised among our 
elders , we young ones greet- 
ed the news with elation. 
As far as we were con- 
cerned, the headlino 
screamed in glee: No 
classes! (A s it turned out. 
Christmas vacation for that 
December of 1941 came ear* 
ly, two weeks early, to be 
exact). 

While we gathered our 
books and notebooks for the 
jubilant trek to home, our 
mathematics teacher, a re- 
servist in the Army, re- 
mained cool and saw the 
algebraic problem on the 
blackboard to the end. I 
don*t recall what X turned 
out to be, but today it 
stands for my mathematics 
teacher (or for many of my 
classmates) because I ne- 
ver heard from him again. 

As we were preparing to 
march out of the classroom 
into the freedom of our 
carefree world, our mathe- 
matics teacher figured that 
by January, 1942, we'd be 
back to the humdrum of 
school chores, "It won't 
take long/* he said, as did 
everybody else. "Foolish 
of those Japanese to fight 
America. What can they 
do with their warships and * 
airplanes that are made of 
sardine cans?" 

That's how almost every- 
body else underestimated 
the Nippon military might 
and overestimated the Al- 
lied strength in the Pacific. 
Because those "sardine 1 
cans/* after making a sor- 
ry mess of the US navy 
yard in Hawaii, went on to 
sink such impregnable Bri- 
tish battleships as the Re- 



pulse and the Prince of 
Wales off Singapore, 

Our mathematics teacher 
was some sort of a whiz 
with his subject but— as we 
learned later— he had com- 
puted, rather, calculated 
wrong about the solution of 
the war. 

Outside the school build- 
ing, to celebrate our early 
and unexpected liberation, 
we headed for our favorite 
refreshment parlor at the* 
corner, forgetting that it 
was owned by a Japanese. 
The place was closed. The 
small, fortyish proprietor 
with the pleatless eyes was 
gone. He must have been 
nabbed by the military au- 
thorities and whisked to the" 
nearest concentration camp. 
(Later, when the invaders 
occupied Manila early Jan- 
uary, I could have sworn 




that one of those fierce- 
looking, bespectacled Japa- 
nese officers waddling down 
the streets was Nigura t my 
old friend who used to run 
a refreshment parlor near 
our school.) 

By this time, the streets 
were filling up with people 
who were spilling out of 
buildings. On many a school 
campus an army comman- 



40 TR£ SUNDAY TIMES MAGAZINE APRIL 9, 1967 



dant was assembling the 
ROTC boys and telling them 
to stand by for further ins- 
tructions from the top 
brass. All of a sudden those 
R(otten) O(ld) T<in) C 
(ans) (as they were joking- 
ly referred to those days) 
locked mighty significant. 
Cocky with the air of early 
manhood, each uniformed 
boy showed eagerness to 
prove his worth in battle. 
What was there to be afraid 
of? Those Japs? "Kayang 
kaya natin sila," they said 
one after the other. 

How f envied them. I was 
only a PMT then, a step 
away from the ROTC eche- 
lon. Those college boys 
could take care of things; 
so. what need was there of 
mere PMT f s? 

It was no war they were 
going to* Not really. ft 
was going to be an adven- 
ture. Already they were 
placing bets on who would 
shoct the most number of 
Japs. For, what could the 
Japanese sumpit or pea 
shooters (that was the ge- 
neral concept of the Nippon 
rifle) do against the power- 
ful Springfields? 

A friend and I reached 
Plaza Law ton where we 
boarded a crowded street 
car. Everybody was talking 
excitedly. You'd think Pre- 
sident Quezon had declared 
the rest of the month a ho- 
liday stretch— with pay. 
Some folks were even grate- 
ful to the Japs for giving 
them a break from their 
bureaucratic tasks. The 
question was, where to 
spend the holiday (or how 
to while the time while the 
Japanese were being driven 
back to their homeland)? 

My friend got off the 
tram via first near Concep- 
cion street. We exchanged 
"See you!" Just like that. I 
never saw him again. 

Back home my mother 
was worried over an older 
brother of mine, a first 
year in college, hence, an 
ROTC boy. He hadn't 
come home yet. He had 
sent word that he'd be 
camping out in their school 
grounds to await the word 
to go to the front. 

A few days later my bro- 
ther came home. The RO- 
TC boys had been disband- 
ed. Some had volunteered, 
but my brother was turned 
away because there weren't 
enough guns to go around. 

"Shucks/' my brother said 
disconsolately. 

He had missed the "ex- 
cursion" to — as it turned 
out later— Bataan.

EYEWITNESS 



By LT. COL. FIDEL L 

WE ENTERED CAMP O'DONNEL, 
known to us as the Gate ot Hell, 
as a batch of more than 2,000 prison- 
ers who had been brought in by shut- 
tle freight trains from San Fernando, 
Pompanga. We were but part of the 
continuous stream of prisoners, the 
Philippine Army, civilian employees of 
the Armed Forces, captured bus driv- 
ers, Philippine scouts and American 
servicemen. 

Camp 0*Donnell sprawled on the low rolling 
foothills of the Zambales Mountain Range. Its 
approximate area was 250 hectares carved out 
of the U.S. Military Reservation of Clark Field. 
It was six kilometers west of Capa s on the roid 
to Crow Valley, the. firing range for airplanes 
of the US Air Force. 

We were herded to the former 71st Division 
parade grounds because O'Donneil was a Fre- 
War training camp of that Division. It was al- 
most noon. The barren white adobe soil reflec- 
ted the sun's sizzling heat. The air did not stir 
a bit, and the heat undulated upwards. 

I gasped and panted like a dog. I gulped the 
air as if it was water but it proved a hopeless 
substitute. My tongue, seemed stuck like glue 
in my parched mouth and throat. 

The towel on my head which I had dipped 
into the dirty roadside ditch at Ar angtmen dried 
after only two minutes. Our water canteens were 
all empty. 

A command was shouted. The high Japa- 
nese commander had arrived. He was Capt. 
Tsuncyoshi. I was to learn later. Unsmiling, 
grim and stern, his face was darkened with 
stubbles of beard and mustache. He went up a 
victory stand with an interpreter at hi s left. 

"In Javer Sumater, FjripinsL , . f * That was 
all I caught of his* cocky speech boasting of the 
victorious Japanese sweep of Java. Sumatra, 
the Philippines and others which I did not care 
to listen to. Besides, we were too busy gasping 
for breath and trying to keep ourselves from 
fainting. 

The bark of a command jolted us from our 
dehydrating stupor after that brief , ^ t weJeome• ,, 
The guards ordered u s to squat, not to sit. They 
inspected, searched sometimes, with menacing 
"kura^ or fist blew cn the face. We were asked 
to show battle. tokens. 



ONGPAUCO, AFP (Ret.) 

An "Aladdir" ga s lamp was the first we 
saw taken to the front. (Did it contain inside it 
those tell-tale mementos?) Other s were piled 
near it. Prisoners were segregated and marked 
with a red "X'* on their shirt breast. The mark- 
ed group was marched out of Camp. There was 
a truckload of them. 

The prisoners' grapevine later told us about 
the short work done by the sword in chopping 
off the heads of the Filipino patriots. Among the 
first to be singled out was Capt, Alberto Quiaoit, 
the uncle of First Lt. Ferdinand Marcos. He 
must have been one of the bravest in the group 
His head was preserved in alcohol, and the Ja- 
panese waited for claimants for many days, but 
none dared to come. 

The groupings 

We were distributed to differed bamboo-and- 
mpa thatched roof barracks. Each was good for 
a company of only 100 pre-war trainees. But it 
was packed with 400 or more prisoners: 

Our area at the farthest end of the Camp 
was designated Subgroup XI and later Subgroup 
XIII when more prisoners came in June from 
Corregidor. My barracks commander wa s Capt. 
Cmlo Daza. I was made platoon leader of one 
of the two platoons. U. Col. Juan O.Chioco head- 
ed our subgroup which was a part of Group IX 
under Brig. Gen. Vicente Lim. 

On May 7, the first Consolidated Strength 
Report was straightened out by the Adjutant 
General's Office. Our total was 41,147 prisoners- 
officers were 2,993; nen-commissioned officers 
11.191; soldiers 25,740; civilians 1,223; and dead 
a s of 7:00 a m. of that day, 212. These totals 
were for Filipinos, The Americans ran a separ- 
ate group for themselves inside the camp. T^ie 
Corregidor Group which surrendered on this day 
was concentrated on the Rock until May 30 

On April 16, we could have been 45,692 AH 
of these and about maybe 10,000 Americans were 
squeezed into the prison camp, which was a 
camp built for 10,000 trainees during pre-war 
days To accommodate those not sheltered in the 
barracks., strong prisoners were assigned to pup 
and squad tents pitched on a wide open space 
away from the barracks. These strong robust 
men easily dried up like dehydrated preserved 
fruits because of the oven-like heat in the low 
tents 

The chief of the Filipino Camp was Maj_ 
Gen. Guiliermo Francisco; hi s Executive Officer 
and the Adjutant General was Col. Nemesio Ca- 
talan; and the Assistant Adjutant General was 
Lfc Col. Facffico C. Sevilla.

A water detail 

We had barely settled in our barracks that 
first afternoon when everybody restlessly looked 
for water. I volunteered to head a water detail. 
I selected 17 men, the 17th would be* the bearer 
of the Japanese flag to walk ahead of the de- 
tail. The Japanese guards at the watch towers 
which were strung around the Camp wanted to 
be sure that the groups going to the wooded area 
of the creek were authorized groups. The creek 
flowed through the eastern edge of the Camp 
about 4 kilometers from our Subgroup XI- It 
was located near (of all places!) the cemetery 
and the Camp hospital. Why? Nobody knew. 
But we could not be too choosy. 

My boys carried an empty 55-gallon gasoline 
drum slung on a stout bamboo pole. We left it 
by the side of the creek and scrambled into the 
dirty brown water like children. There were 
many other water details with us. In between 
the men splashing in the breast-deep water I 
lowered myself into the precious expanse of 
stream. With soulful gratitude, I drank deeply 
the water, never thinking of the grime from the 
unclean bodies, the microbes from the hospital 
or cemetery. Neither did we mind the brown 
silt rising to the surface of the water. We had 
been denied water so long. 



Sanitation, medicine and food 




I never heard of any Japanese regulation in 
camp prohibiting the boiling of drinking water. 
But it was known that 1st Lt. Rafael Garcia was 
slapped for one minute by a Japanese soldier 
when his soldier was found doing it. 

Medicines were not given to the Camp Hos- 
pital much less to the Subgroup dispensaries.. 
Disinfectants were nit The only water reservoir 
with running water was exclusively for the Ja- 
panese. For the prisoners, all water should come 
from that dirty stream. Latrines became filled 
to overflowing with maggots crawling out thick- 
ly. New latrines were dug but the holes were 
not covered. No boards nor nails were available. 
Straddle latrine trenches later abound. The air 
became dark with thick swarms of big bloated 
horseflies. Every* blade of grass, leaf, . twig, 
branch, post, barbed wire, bench, even the 
dying patients, were infested with these blue 
pests. They ecmpetedwith us m eating our food, 
so that we had to eat inside our mosquito net. 

Leaves of alibangbang, tamarind, malungay, 
guava, bark of duhat and guava, were all gone 
in a few days. They were used for food or me- 
dicine. Even the lowly weeds, **kupit-kupit" or 
**raaramani ,t were eaten. The unknown **bam- 
hangsit" wild plant wa s used a* medicine. The 
ingenious Hooanos were experts in discovering 
die usefulness of hitherto unknown beneficient 
plants, Not only weeds but also small tadpoles 
were eaten. 

Some would scrape the bones of newly-but- 
chered cows, mixing the scrapings with cast-off 
hides which were cut into small pieces. With 
some weeds they boiled the concoction in their 
canteen cup. Presto, there was a good brcth. It 
was good for the stomach. It gave warmth but 
Was tasteless and had no food value. 

Those culinary experiments augmented in a 
small way the meager rations frcm the prisoners' 
mess. In one of our Subgroup^ kitchen, Vero 
Perfeeto, the popular radio announcer, was our 
enviable mess officer. Because to be a mess 
officer at the time, you sometimes determined 
the destiny of the Philippines. 

Camotes were our common food. But, oh, 
what a camote could do for -a man! 

Once, two very weak prisoners quarreled over 
a camote. They weakly swung at each other, 
then fell apart with the camote between them. 
They lay panting and reaching for the camote 
until they fell into a coma.

Malaria and pneumonia 
killed off men like flies 



Camotes were cut into little cubes. They 
were sometimes mixed with the rice or placed 
in a soup. The soup looked like chocolate al- 
though there was no cocoa in it. The color came 
from the brown soil irom the unwashed carnote. 
"Kangkcng" for scup was nourishing but there 
were no 45,000 kangkcng leaves to feed 45,000 
mouths. Besides, the cooks and the officers 
would have more than one leaf for their share. 
What would be left? Water. 

Representative Don Pepe Urquieo, Don Gon 
zalo Aquino, Ex-mayor Arsenio Lugay, Mr, Co- 
nigundo Espiritu and other civic-spirited and 
charitable Tarlaqueik> s worked hard to send us 
foodstuff as well as cows from their ranches for 
free. 

We saw the cows butchered, divided. At 
call to mess, we vainly tried to look for traces 
of the cow, Well, of course, it would confound 
even the best mathematician to divide cne cow 
between 42,000 persons, 

"No hoter-rn" 

General Francisco, the fight general who 
had the concern of the prisoners at heart, 
cne time went to complain to Captain Tsuneyo- 
shi about the inadequate supply of food and me- 
dicines, The hardhearted officer curtly said: 
"This is no hoter-ru." Hie Aranguren execu- 
tions were repeated for flimsier reasons. 

Tsuneyoshi was executed for crueity to pri- 
soners on a sentence of the War Crimes Court 
after the war. Col, S, Ito who took his place 
sometime in late June was a kind man. But that 
was after thousands of prisoners had perished. 

Blindness, beri beri, dysentery 

I saw how one of my soldiers, Rico Adriano 
of Rizal, Nueva Eerja, , called to me, "Sir, sir? 
I cannot see any more! *' then sank into the sea 
of blindness for want of just a few vitamin tablets. 

My own cousin, Maximo Manalastas, 22 of 
Gapan, Nueva Ecija, was a victim of beri-beri. 
I shared with him the mongo seeds sent to me 
by my wife through my cousin, Engr, Jose Ong- 
paueo (who swapped places with a carpenter) 
but the inadequate mongos did not save his life. 

I saw how a few tablets of sulfathiasol, the 
new wonder drug at the time, saved the life of 
my friend, Lt, Severo Santiago. He was weak 
from dysentery. I shared with him a few of my 
tablets. He is now a millionaire. 

According to my official records, the No. 1 
killer in the Camp wa s malaria. A s of June 1, 
at the peak of the Disease Graph, there were 
5.278 prisoners downed with it. But the actual 
killer was not malaria, but pneumonia which 
was not listed by the doctors. Pneumonia was 
not the original sickness but at night it would 
give the coup de grace because of the peculiar 
Tarlac weather: too hot in the day, too cold at 
night. 

On that day (June 1) there were 12,515 sick 
prisoners: 5,278 with malaria, 2,697 with dysen- 
tery, 3,857 from others.

(On May 31? the Corregidor Group began to 
arrive in the Camp. On June 30, many sick pri- 
soners were released,} 

Early each morning, the usual greeting would 
be hot u How are you?" but "How many died?" 
It was a common experience for one to awaken 
on the morrow beside a stiff companion, 

The dead were placed on the open ground 
near the barracks where identification slips 
would be pasted on their foreheads The slips 
usually got lost. The method of Captain Gaiica- 
no Lotuaeo in the Hospital Group wa s more ef- 
fective: bottles were tied to the arms of the 
corpses. The bottle contained the slip of paper 
with the personal data and wa s corked. These 
were the only known dead. 

Eight or twelve men were bearers of every 
corpse in the burial detail. The corpses were 
carried in the position they died in. It was im- 
possible to close their eyes and mouth or to 
straighten their stiff legs and arms, 

The litters were bamboo covered with cogon 
grass. The dead were also blanketed with grass. 
Other bodies were placed in blankets slung on 
bamboo poles. Oftentimes the bearers assigned 
to the detail were sickly. When they reached the 
cemetery they would collapse, and would be 
buried along with their burdeii. 

At the height of the deaths (383 a day was 
the highest,) 500 diggers were assigned to dig 
the graves in three shifts of about five hours. 
Each grave was for 20 corpses, There were also 
20 gravediggers under an officer. Lt. Cesar 
Montemayor was one such officer in charge of 
20 diggers. Their shift was from 7:30 a.m. to 
12:00 noon. There was a recorder in each shift 
to get the personal data of the dead; the mass 
grave number as welt as the block number. A 
cross was planted on the common grave of 20. 

Most of the grave diggers beginning June 
Were Philippine Scouts from Corregidor. Each 
common grave wa s four feet deep .three meters 
lcng and a corpse length in width. The 20 corp- 
ses would be pressed face to face by pairs or 
Iain facing opposite directions. There were days 
when grave digging could not be finished not on- 
ly because of the weak condition of the diggers 
but because of the big number of corpses Many 
corpses would then be left to be buried on the 
morrow- Sometimes the diggers would die and 
the corpses would be left to rot. The foul odor 
could be smelled as far as the farthest end of 
the Camp. Other times, after a rain, the bloat- 
ed corpses would float in the shallow graves, 

One of the corpses left unburied was 1st Lt, 
Jose P. Rodriguez of Aracelis, Palawan. He 
"died" of dysentery. At 3:00 o'clock in the morn- 
ing, Rodriguez stirred, opened hi s eyes and 
thought he was in Purgatory* 

He pinched his arm and felt pain. He rolled 
over and slowly crawled out of the ditch. At 5:30 
that morning he reached the line of the barracks. 
The modern "Lazarus 11 still lives.

Escape from camp 

Major Eulogio Balao was an unsung hero of 
the camp. 

The Japanese authorities had warned the sub- 
group and group commanders from the very lie- 
ginning that any escape would result in their 
heads being chopped off* 

Lt. Col, Alejandro D. Garcia, the group com- 
mander of the Hospital Group, faced such a fall. 
A PC officer, afflicted with cerebral malaria,

became violent and had to be placed in the stock- 
ade. But he was able to escape not only from 
the stockade but also from the camp, despite 
the searchlights and machineguns. 
Colonel Garcia was frantic and hurried to 
Balao. 

"All right, sir," said Balao, "I will place him 
dead in my burial report/' 

Colonel Garcia was no longer worried. 



Early the next morning, a man insisted on 
entering the gate It wag the escaped patient I 

Balao was summoned. He saw Juban. Ba 
lao's coolness under pressure made him speak 
with composure. 

"This Capteng Juban. He go guava detail. 
He sick. He come only now. He no more sick," 

''Ah, oke, oke," Luckily the Japanese never 
bothered to countercheck the death report. 

Captain Juban died two days later. He was 
a brave PC officer who contacted malaria in 
Bataan while fighting for his country. 

One time a father wrote Balao. 

"Dear Major, 1 have a son who is seriously 
ill with malaria, I want him to die near my side 
if he should die. Kindly bury him tomorrow 
near the fence of the cemetery. When you bury 
him T please place him above another corpse and 
please don't cover his mcuth and nose with 
earth. Please place a conspicuous marker." 

Major Balao, being the big-hearted man 
he always was, assigned his trusted MP ser- 
geant, Orquia, to accomplish the mission. 

The corpse was buried as requested, A polo 
was placed over the grave, the canteen cup of 
Sergeant Orquia placed on it. By midnight the 
father and his companions escaped with the 
corpse. 

Next morning, Lt. Col. F. Villaluz, the strict 
chief of inspectors called Major Balao, He asked 
for Orquia. He was missing. Major Balao ex- 
plained. Villaluz showed the canteen cup with 
the name of Orquia. The corpse escaped, but Or- 
quia escaped with it. Col. Villaluz was not a col- 
laborator If he were. Major Balao would not 
have become a senator and Reparations Com- 
missioner* 

Colonel Chioco's Subgroup XI was the easiest 
place to escape from. Being near the road to 
Crow Valley with a few strands of wire sepa- 
rating the prisoners from freedom, about 2,000 
captives were able to make their bid for free- 
dom. 

Colonel Chioco had to rush to Balao many 
times, asking him to "put to death" the men who 
escaped. Balao "killed** 2,000 prisoners in that 
manner. 

lieutenant Felizardo Tanabe was in a sub- 
group of a certain PC colonel. Thisr colonel told 
the officers and men of the group not to escape. 
He said it was very risky. It would be foolhardy 
for any of them to escape. That night the col- 
onel escaped, 

Mrs. Josefa LJaaes Escoda 

If ever there was any patriot who dedicated 
herself to alleviate the sufferings and anxiety 
not only of the prisoners of war in O'Donnell but 
also of their families, it was Mrs Josefa Llanes 
Escoda. 

Many of the prisoners were never aware of 
her sacrifices. 

When Lt. Col. Adolfo Castillo gave Mrs. 
Escoda f400 for delivery to his wife in College, 
Laguna, he saw in Mrs. Escoda a woman who 
exuded trust, kindness, and almost saintliness. 
Mrs. Castillo received the salary of her prison- 
er-husband. 

Letter-writing was not allowed by the Japa- 
nese guards. Letters were therefore surrepti- 
tiously thrown anywhere on the ground by the 
captives to be picked up by Mrs. Escoda or her

workers for delivery anywhere in the Philippines 
or the United States if the writer were an Am- 
erican, On the other end, wives, mothers, sis- 
ters and other kin of internees were helped by 
Mrs, Escoda 's group to contact the prisoners- 
Mrs. Escoda and her patriotic workers so- 
licited medicines and canned foods from donors 
at great personal sacrifice. Collections were 
sent to the prisoners. Whether the medicines and 
foods were received by the internees was imma- 
terial (We did not receive them.) Mrs. Escoda 
and her workers deserve gratitude from the in- 
ternees, 

Pete Celestino of the YMCA was doing the 
same work as Mrs. Escoda, The Red Cross, I 
know, sent medicines, food and athletic equip- 
ment to the camp, ' The athletic goods were 
received but not the food and medicine. 

The birth of the details 

Captain Fernando Tinio, a medical officer, 
told Lt. CoL Eliseo Q. Bringas, the director of 
the camp hospital, to suggest to the Japanese 
medical adviser to allow Filipino prisoners to 
gather guava leaves and duhat bark to combat 
the epidemic of dysentery among the prisoners 
inasmuch as the Japanese were not giving any 
medicines. 

The Japanese commander approved the re- 
quest through the Nipponese doctor. The one 
condition imposed was, the five enlisted men 
who would go out should have their heads shaved. 
Captain Tinio was exempted from the shaving. 

That was how the guava detail and all other 
details were born. Prior to that, there was no 
means of communication between the outside 
world and the internment camp. 

On the first day of the detail, Captain Tinio 
wrote the names of prisoners on the posts of a 
nipa house in Barrio Aringoring. He also wrote 
many others on the trunks of guava trees. He 
requested the owner of the hut to tell the people 
in Capas about those names. 

The next day, wives, mothers and other kin 
of captives swarmed around Tinio's group, but 
the guards kept them off. So the families sur- 
reptitiously threw to Tinio messages and medi- 
cines for their captured soldier-kin. 

1st. Lt, Ferdinand E. Marcos 

The news of contact with the outside word 
spread like wildfire inside the camp. One of 
those who heard about it was Lt. Marcos. He 
went to see Capt. Tinio and Capt, Lotuaco who 
were his comrades in the 21st Division, 

"I know that my mother will send me me- 
dicines. Will you please find out if one of the 
packages is mine?" Captain Tinio looked into 
his bag but he could not find any package for 
Ferdinand. So as not to dissappoint hirr^ Tinio 
and Lotuaco got from their personal kits three 
tablets each of the then precious wonder drug, 
sulfathiasol, and gave them to Marcos. 

Mrs. Marcos hastened to Capas as soon as 
she learned that her son was there. 

Young Marcos then was frail ( haggard and 
pale. He became sick of malaria /dysentery and 
there was always the nagging pain of the bullet 
wound in his leg. 

Through the guava detail and the "Escoda 
Mail," Lt. Marcos was able to communicate again 
with his mother. He wrote her a stanza from 
the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, 

"The Moving Finger writes; and, having 
writ. 

Moves on. Nor all your piety nor wit 

shall lure it back to cancel half a line 

Nor all your tears was out a word of it," 

The Rubaiyat was a soothing balm to his 
mother's anxiety. He wrote further, 

"Mammy, I want to stay with my comrades- 
in-arms. 1 don't want to be released ahead of 
them."

On June It, young Ferdinand wanted so 
much to see Ms mother. He felt he had reco- 
vered enough io go out on a guava detail. He 
told his uncle, Major Simeon Valdez, about it. 
It was agreed that they would go on the 13th. 
They wrote, Marcos to his mother, Valdez to his 
sister, Angela, who was accompanying Mrs. 
Marcos* 

On June 13 early in the morning, there was 
the usual knocking of the heads by a wooden 
rod, u Its t ni, san, si . - * (One, two, three, 
four . . .**) Once your head was knocked , you 
were overjoyed. You were in the detail. 

That noon after picking guava leaves, they 
were allowed to go with their families to eat 
lunch. With the group was Captain Victor Her- 
nandez, the classmate of Mrs. Marcos. Mrs. 
Hernandez was also there. 

LL Marcos was very helpful. He had a big 
hoart for those who needed help, Major Alfonso 
Arellano was bed-ridden with malaria, He could 
not get his food. The others could hardly help 
themselves. Lt, Marcos got the meals for the 
major. Twenty -four years later, the major be- 
came a general and an Undersecretary of De- 
fense. The lieutenant became the Commander- 
in-Chief and President; Fate reversed the "Sirs" 
but still the Chief's bigness of heart never 
changed, 

"The President Marcos March" was born in 
the concentration camp. IA, Primitive* Sales, a 
born musician and composer, produced one of 
the best pieces of music he ever created. It 
was born out of pathos ana longings not for a 
long lost love, but for the "kitchen. It was but 
natural for one tc dedicate his bom talent to the 
Altar of Food, Sales wanted Co survive. He did 
survive because of that music. 

When he was released, the gate guard me- 
nacingly said "Kura" pointing to the piece. 

"Muuuusic!" emphasized Sales, 

"Sing" ordered the guards. 

With gusto, Sales sang, "Miyofco oka ino f 
sora a kele It was the beautiful Japa- 

nese March, taught to us In camp.' The guards 
were very happy, 

"Oke t oke. Go." they patted Sales. 

This March was first played by the AFP 
Band under the baton of Col, Laureano Carina 
at the first testimonial parade for the new Pre- 
sident. 

Survival 

"Survival is the primary mission of all mili- 
tary personnel . . , under any and ail circums- 
tances/ 1 Students of survival courses were taught 
methods for staying alive, but the most impor- 
tant method, Faith in God, many knew by Ins- 
tinct. 

I found this cut in Bataan the Death March, 
the Concentration Camp — that brawn and phy- 
sical courage are not all; physical fortitude is 
not enough, positive belief in survival is what 
counts. 

I cherished three prayers; the first was, "The 
Lord is my Shepherd , , . Even though I go 
through the valley of the shadow of death, I 
fear no evil because thou art with me/' The 
second was, "Master, Master, I believe! I be- 
lieve! I believe I will live! I will live!" The 
third was to press these deep into the subcons- 
cious mind which in turn pressed them down to 
the positive protons of your atoms. The positive 
thoughts become wave length to Jesus whose 
wave length in turn went back to you. You felt 
Him say, "Son, be it unto thee even as thou wilt," 

The heat of human conflict could account 
for the cruelties. Human nature has not changed 
since Adam. . A Filipino fighter could commit 
similar abuses in times of unbridled combat fury. 

What is more, the Japanese people have 
since expressed sorrow for the atrocities com- 
mitted by their . military, rutN TO next wof

WHERE EARLIER she was too shocked and 
numb to feel where the wounds rankled, 
Bataan is now ready to bare her scars. After 
twenty-five years of peace and convalescence, 
Bataan, together with other battle-wounded 
areas in the country, is today fully recovered, 
firmer and stronger than before tragedy struck. 

With the wisdom of one who has endured 
much, Bataan does not mind now reminiscing 
over her travails during the war. At a stranger's 
request, her people can be easily prompted to 
recount the details of their war experience, apart 
from what were, and are, normally told by his- 
torians. There is no hesitance in the recalling 
and no rancour in the telling of these war me- 
mories. 

A s is only necessary, some people of Bataan 
would limit their version to the circumstances 
they had fallen into during the early part of the 
war- their way of living (or unliving) then, and 
their contribution to the resistance put up by 
the joint Filipino and American forces in the 
province. As is also essential, one who wanted 
to get these details should go, by all means, to 
Bataan. 

One who goes by car might see the scars of 
Bataan, but especially one who stops at every 



kilometer sign. In revisiting the area, the STM 
took notice of each stretch of significant land; 
STM also met and interviewed more than a 
handful of civilians living in almost the same 
dwellings that they had at the outbreak of the 
war. 

Thus it was that, recently along the highway 
in Ma ba tang near Mt. Natib, site of the secend 
battle line in Bataan (the first line was in Di- 
nalupihan extending to Hermosa), we saw from 
where we stood an expanse of canefield cut 
through by summer-dried irrigation canals. And 
where did one of the bloodiest skirmishes hap- 
pen? Right there by one of the canals, where 
a group of boys, from age 8 to 10, armed with 
bamboo sticks and sugar cane stems, came 
marching by! Towards the mountain, the land- 
scape gradually rcse with the inevitable man- 
groves. Higher, huts and lean-tos dotted the 
hillside but visible only up to where the bigger 
trees were, under which, so the Mabatang peo- 
ple said, most of the defenders, twenty-five years 
ago, made camps, dug fc-xholes, waited for the 
enemy and then fought until they were forced 
to retreat and form the next resistance line on 
the ^ilar-Bagac road. 

Two men, roused from their afternoon sies- 



ta, pointed at a burning spot at the foot of Mt. 
Natib. Kaingin or not, the sight of the smoke \ 
set one of the men, Roman Canare, reminiscing. 
Canare, now aged 70, was 45 years old when Ba- 
taan fell. 

**Ang usok ho noon ay Mndi hasta usofc; may 
baking putok," said Canare, adding that they 
bad to evacuate far into Mt. Natib when the 
smoke of fighting started to enlarge at the foot 
of the mountain. But when the battle began 
to shift uphill, he and his family together with I 
some other evacuees came down and hid in va- 
rious areas along the seashore. 

In the process of evacuation, Mr. Canare re- 
called how they had to subsist on camotes along 
the way and how *>nce settled at some place, 
they had to eat grass and weeds. "Para learning 
mga baboy noon, Mabuti pang naJcakawala da- 
hit nakakakuha naman kami ng pagkaJn pero 
nang mnktilong kami sa Isang lugar, wala na 
learning makain." (We were like pigs then we 
could find food when we were moving but when 
we were stuck to one place we had practically 
nothing). 

The other man, also a native of Mabatang. 
was kind enough to take us farther into the hill 
where he said the Japanese forces onrushing

from all directions, rendered heavy casualties in 
the defenders*, line. Anions cogon grass, Fran- 
cisco Silva, 47, narrate* in the dialect what he 
had seen. "The last wave of the defenders were 
cornered here and several of them I saw killed. 
I even nursed one American soldier to health 
after I saw him crawling in a stream. He was 
wounded an$ sick with malaria. My neighbors 
witnessed the same thing. But they helped most- 
ly the Filipino soldiers. Our men fought hard 
but could not beat the Japanese. 

"My hut which used to stand right here was 
burned to the ground by the Japanese when they 
finally took over. Hie defenders were driven 
I hack to the plains. 

"I noticed something unusual when the first 
r ware of Japanese began their assault in this hill. 
They were all shouting. I could hear them from 
afar when I with my family started to come 
| down, to the seashore/* 

Silva's parents died during the war, not by 
the bullet, he said but "because of hard life. We 
had to subsist on grass until the Americans 
came and liberated us/* 

When liberation came, Silva recalled, ;as 
others in Mabatang did, how he made an occu- 
pation of collecting battered helmets, ammuni- 
tions and guns abandoned by both the Japanese 
and USAFFE forces. "We sold them teethe Am- 
ericans or to anybody interested in them. I had 
sold more than 100 rifles. We were hauling 
gun s and ammunitions by the caromalau" 

As late as last year, Silva said mat they 
could still find old helmets, old machine guns, 
cannon shells and ammunitions in the area, A 
plausible statement this, considering tile nature 
of the fighting there. 

ks we trudged back to the highway, we met 
again the group of boys near the irrigation ca- 
nal: they did not look like they were play- 
ing soldier any more. It was obvious that they 
had been digging beside the canal. And that 
rusty thing they were trying to carry across to 
the other ditch was a cannon shell. 

Atop Mount Samat, several kilometers away, 
the late afternoon wind howled, stirring the co- 
gon grass downwards. An easterly turn of the 
neck was just right: from here, to see the flat 
terrain, a more pastoral scene where at sunset 
the fog settles at as low as the tips of sugar 
cane, and farther, over the waters of Manila 
Bay, 

But what was immediately eye-catching 
w& \ the hillside, where an avenue-wide road 
was being built. Where the defenders twenty- 
five years ago had made a lost last ditch stand, 
now here a new breed of soldiers clung at a 
cliff of triumph. For who could look more vic- 
torious than this batch of soldiers, armed with 
shovels and pikes and levelling the hillside with 
tractors and bulldozers? Immediately it became 
clear that this company of soldiers now was 
part of the construction group commissioned to 
build the national shrine atop 500 ft. Mount Sa- 
mat, (By this time, the Bataan-Corregidor Na- 
tional Shrines Commission headed by Defense 
Undersecretary Manuel B.Syquio, should be 
putting the finishing touches to the construction.) 

As envisioned by the planners, a steel cross 
measuring 88 meters high including the platform 
would be erected. The cress when illuminated 
at night would be visible from as far a$ Manila, 
a distance of some 150 kilometers. 

Atop Mount Samat, other vistas became en- 
chant ingly clear. To the south are Mt. Lamay 
and the Mariveles mountains towering over 
everything they could — undulations of balding 
hiils and flat vegetations. At this point, where 
the Mariveles town was not visible, it should 
please the historian no end to know that we, too* 
^remembered: a quarter of a century ago, in that 
town, the infamous march of death began.

THOSE who saw and heard the actual fighting in Bataan and Corregidor can tell! 
where the protagonists met. Likewise the generation that came after therh t for 
soon when peace settled again on the battle lines, the witnesses and the wounded re- 
turned to mark where the enemy triumphed and the defender fell. Markers, either in 
bronze or stone were properly made and shrines and monuments built, Even now, 
25 years after the Fall, memorials for the heroes are continuously being put up, 
where the significant events took place, as on Mount Samat. But of course where there 
are as yet no monuments to mark the heroic scene, both the witnesses and the new 
generation will have to settle for some other reminder, like that where children 
play soldier now or where an old helmet lies untouched on a rock, or where as eve- 
ning falls, the ghosts of the brave men seem to rise,

GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR 
was in his headquarters in MeU 
bourne, Australia, pacing back and 
forth as was his wont when in deep 
thought, when he received the message 
that Bataan had fallen* 

An aide handed the note and after Mao 
Arthur had read it, he pursed his lips into one 
long thin line and then quietly put it down on 
his desk. He had long expected the blow to 
come; but when it came he still had to muster 
all the will in him to maintain a soldierly com- 
posure so needed at that moment. He cancelled 
all his appointments for that day, April 9 P 1942, 
and closeted himself in his office. In the outer 
room, his staff could only hear the regular beat 
of his footsteps as he paced to and fro through- 
out the afternoon. Finally, he sat down and 
scribbled a message that was to be the epilogue 
to the Battle of Bataan, His eyes were notice- 
ably red when he gave it to an aide for trans- 
mission. It read: 

"The Bataan force Went out as it would have 
wished, fighting to the end in its flickering, for- 
lorn hope. No Army has ever done so much 
with so little, and nothing became it more than 
its last hour of trial and agony , . .** 

And so the first chapter of the Battle of Ba- 
taan came to a close. 

Corregidor was next, and it fell on May 6. 
General Jonathan Wainwright, MacArthur's suc- 
cessor as commander of the USAFFE forces in 
the Philippines, in a short message to Mac- 
Arthur, told of the end of the island fortress: 
"We are sad but not ashamed . . . good-bye, 
genera) . , 

MacArthur received two successive blows in 
a month's time and to a general who ardently 
believes that "in war there is no substitute for 
victory, ' this was a gall just too bitter to take. 
As with Bataan, he delivered the valedictory for 
the now mute survivors of the Battle of Corre- 
gidor: 

"Corregidor needs no comment from me. If 
has sounded its own story at the mouth of its 
guns. It has scrolled its own epitaph on enemy 
tablet. But through the bloody haze of its last, 



pines* On December 28, 1941, Roosevelt said in 
a radio message beamed to the Philippines: "I 
give to the Philippines my solemn pledge that 
their freedom will be redeemed and their inde- 
pendence established and protected. The entire 
resources in men and materials of the United 
States stand behind that pledge . , .* 
■ The entire resources in men and materials 
of the United States stood behind that pledge. 
But that was all. At the time Roosevelt gave 
that pledge MacArthur's forces were already re- 
treating to Bataan for a delaying action pending 
the arrival of reinforcements* They never came. 
Bataan turned out to be a last stand. 

MacArthur and the Filipino people accepted 
this assurance, unsuspecting that even then 
Roosevelt had already given a hint that no rein- 
forcements would come. The vital word is re- 
deemed. War in the Philippines was then only 
2ft days old, a great part of the country was still 
unoccupied by enemy forces and the USAFFE 
was still full of fight despite the los s of air and 
naval support, There was no reason to think of 
redeeming what had not been lost yet, unless 
Roosevelt had already seen that the Philippines 
would fall. 

The Pentagon and the US Pacific Fleet shar- 
ed the views of the President. Compared to the 
much larger war theatre of Europe, the Philip* 
pines held a subordinate role in the overall view. 

Before Roosevelt's December 28 message, 
Dwight Eisenhower, then an obscure brigadier 
general in the pJans-and-operations division of 
the War Department, conferred with his supe- 
rior, Army chief of staff General Marshall, This 
was recorded in his book, Crusade in Europe. The 
date of the conference was December 14 ( or 
barely two weeks after the bombing of Pearl 
Harbor. 

Eisenhower said, addressing Marshall: "Gen- 
eral, it will be along time before major rein- 
forcements can go to the Philippines, longer 
than the garrison can hold out with any driblet 
of assistance,** 

Marshall replied: "I agree with you,** 
The US War Department, unknown to the 
Filipinos and MacArthur who was then continu- 
ously asking for reinforcements, had written off 
the Philippines as good as a lost case. 



Lack of air and naval 
support and Washington's "deception" 
doomed the Philippines to

reverberating shot r I shall always seem to see 
a vision of grim, gaunt, ghastly men, still un- 
afraid." 

The first phase of the Battle of the Philip- 
pines, except for some scattered guerilla actions, 
was to all intents and purposes, ended. 

Assurances from Roosevelt 

President Roosevelt gave assurances that the 
United States would never forsake the Philip- 



No help coming 

It was MacArthur, almost alone, who be- 
lieved that the Japanese invaders should and 
could be checked in the Philippines, And after 
the archipelago fell, MacArthur insisted and wen 
over the contrary opinion of Admiral Nimitz 
and General Marshall, that recovery of the Phil- 
ippines was just as important as the defeat of 
Japan. He mentioned American commitments

to this country. Victory in the Philippines, as 
events later proved, cut into half the Japanese 
empire. MacArthur's calculations were correct. 
The way was paved for the final blow on Japan. 

While Washington and the Pentagon were 
infected with defeatism, MacArthur and the 
USAFFE t not knowing that they now stood atone 
amid a sea controlled by the enemy, continued 
to fight while practically all of Southeast Asia ; 
had fallen. 

At the time that the battle for the Philip- 
pines was reaching its climax in the jungles of 
Bataan and the jagged rocks of Corregidor, rein- 
forcements that might have changed the situation 
from one of desperation and impending defeat 
to a surge to victory, were being rushed to Mur- 
mansk, Russia, to the tank battles in North Af- 
rica, and to England. 



Deception? 

To fight a losing battle is probably unac- 
ceptable to any soldier. The prospect of getting 
killed in that battle adds to the- gall and breaks 
one of the cardinal principles of war which 
is survival. Yet this is precisely the kind of 
battle MacArthur unknowingly had to wage ag- 
ainst the Japanese. General Courtney 
Whitney in his book, MaeArtnur; His rendezvous 
with history, said that "the deception practiced 
on MacArthur brought tragedy tq thousands of 
Americans and more thousands of Filipios. 

"And the basis for this deception, the global 
planning behind it, has brought tragedy to the 
world. At that time . . . the British were , w . 
withstanding General Rommel's threat to the 
Middle East and the Russian armie s were dig- 
ging in for their successful defense of Stalin- 
grad. Our target date for the attack in Europe 
from the west was still two or three years off, 

"In the Pacific . ... we still had enough na- 
val power to engage any Axis fleet. We proved 



this only six months later when, with practically 
no new major elements added to our naval arm t 
we scored decisive victories in the battles of 
Coral Sea (May 7, a day after the fall of Corre- 
gidor) and Midway (June 3-6, 1942). But we 
fchose to hold our punch in the Pacific, 

"It was a major strategic blunder, one for 
which we have paid dearly and one for which 
we will continue to pay for a long time to come. 
It established the basic "Europe-first" concept 
• that not only set up an automatic military prior- 
ity for Europe but also assumed unnecessary de- 
feats in other vital areas of the world,** 

One of $fiese "unnecessary defeats" was the 
loss of the, Philippines. Whitney continued: 
"Ifed we elected to stop Japan's advance at the 
outset, when MacArthur wanted us to (and had 
the plan for doing it), we would have avoided 
the costly tragedy of the long-drawn-out . Pacific 
war. Japan's axis partners, stymied at that 
time in the Middle East and on the eastern front, 
would have suffered a psychological setback of 
major proportions. 

"And we would have preserved Asia from 
the ravages of Communist imperialism (of which 
China is a good example; she was practically 
delivered on a silver platter to the Reds), 

"Thus even apart from the cruel deception 
practiced on our defending forces and the Phil- 
ippine people, our decision to start the Pacific war 
by losing it was one of the most tragic ever 
made in the history of the nation," 

Quezon's disenchantment 

Quezon, along with MacArthur and the rest 
of the Filipino people, also pinned much hope 
on Roosevelt^ pledge in December 2& But as 
the slaughter in Bataan and Corregidor conti- 
nued, and with no prospect of aid except Roose- 
velt's "pledge," Quezon told MacArthur, hoping 
it would reach Roosevelt, that: 

"My loyalty and the loyalty of the Filipino 



people to America has been proven beyond ques- 
tion . . . But it seems to me questionable whe- 
ther any government has the right to demand 
loyalty from its citizens beyond its willingness 
or ability to render actual protection ... We 
have done the best we could , . . 

"But how long are we to be left alone? Has 
it already been decided in Washington that the 
Philippine front is of no importance as far as 
the final result o! the war is concerned and that, 
therefore, no help can be expected here in the 
immediate future, or at least before the power 
of resistance is exhausted? If so, I want to 
know because I have my own responsibility to 
my countrymen whom, as President of the Com- 
monwealth, I have led into a complete war ef- 
fort. I am greatly concerned a s well regarding 
the soldier I have called to the colors and who 
are now manning the firing line. 

**I want to decide in my own mind whether 
there is justification for allowing all these men 
to be killed when, for the final outcome of the 
war, the shedding of their blood may be wholly 
unnecessary , m /' 

Roosevelt's reply was a further assurance: 
**I solemnly state that I would never ask of you 
(and your countrymen) any sacrifice that I be- 
lieved was without hope . . .** 

Continuing his reply, Roosevelt said: M I can 
assure you that every vessel available is bear- 
ing to the southwest Pacific the strength that 
will eventually have been filled with cargos of 
necessary supplies and have been dispatched to 
Manila . * .** 

The vessels and the necessary supplies never 
came. The Philippines was doomed. 

A neutral Philippines 

Quezon was so disenchanted with these 
pledges that he proposed to MacArthur the with- 
drawal of both American and Japanese troops 
from the Philippines and tile establishment of 
(he country as a neutral state. MacArthur for- 
warded Quezon's proposal to Roosevelt without 
comment, 

Quezon's proposal also called for the demo- 
bilization of the Philippine Army into a consta- 
bulary of moderate size and the evacuation of 
Japanese and American noncombatants from the 
Philippines if they so desired. 

High Commissioner *Sayre, who wa s also in 
Corregidor agreed wiiJi Quezon. He said in a 
note to Roosevelt that "if the premise of Pres- 
ident Quezon is correct that American help can- 
not or will not arrive in time to be available, I 
believe hi s proposal for immediate independence 
is the sound course to follow." 

Roosevelt rejected these and ordered Mac- 
Arthur to continue the fight as long as there re- 
mained "any possibility of resistance." 

It was only after Quezon's proposal of Phil- 
ippine neutralization did Roosevelt finally admit 
that no aid indeed was coming to the Philip- 
pines. He said, again with a note of assurance, 
that "whatever happens to the present American 
garrison, we shall not relax our efforts until the 
forces we are now marshalling outside of the 
Philippine Islands return to the Philippines arid 
drive the last remnant of the invaders from your 
sou\ w 

Hie rest is history t or known to history, Ba- 
taan and Corregidor fell. Quezon retreated to the 
south in a submarine and finally to the US. Mac- 
Arthur, after repeated orders from Roosevelt 
finally left the islands and went to Australia, 
where he regrouped and march back to recover 
the Philippines. 

The consequences of the fall of the Philip- 
pines up to now have not been fully understood. 
MacArthur, however, had previously warned 
Roosevelt "that yielding the Philippines by de- 
fault and without a major effort would mark the 
end of white prestige in the East . . r and thai 
the United States might as well *\ . , withdraw 
in shame from the Orient/'

ANDRE MAUROIS SPEAKS 






THE press and the radio 
have described in great 
detail the funeral of Mar- 
shal Juin. What ha s perhaps 
not been emphasized strong- 
ly enough i$ the extraordin- 
ary beauty of these rites. 
Notre-Dame was never 
more admirable than dress- 
ed In such simplicty. No,, 
draperies, no flowers. Oqjy.- 
a huge blue, white and r$d 
flag covered the coffin. 
The stained glass windows 
and the rose windows allow- 
ed only a mysterious, sup- 
ernatural light to- 'filter 
through. At the far ejd, in 
the choir, was an oraerly 
assembly of prelates, can- 
nons and choir boys. Noth- 
ing is mere moving, at the 
funeral of a great i^ii^r, 
than the sounding oi^ltfux 
Champs and . Aux Moris, 
under the eight hundred 
year old arches. I saw again 
General Juin as he was in 
the Army of. Italy, so friend- 
ly and so strong. I was mov- 
ed and I felt that everyone 
around me was, too. 

The homage of the Army 
was no less perfect than 
that of the Church. On the 
esplanade of the Invalides, 
as at Notre-Dame, simplici- 
ty and order reigned. A 
huge crowd surrounded the 
square and lined the Seine. 
The parade was sublime. 
So many memories are 
evoked for each Frenchman 
by those illustrious march- 
es to which, in our youth, 
our feet so often kept heat. 
What satisfaction for the 
spirit to find again the 
Ecole Poly technique, black 
and red, austere and intel- 
ligent, with its shining 
swords; the Saint-Cyriens 
in bright colors and their 
legendary plumes; the Ecole 
de I'Air and the Ecole Na- 
vale? There our great men 
were formed; there lie cur 
memories and our hopes. 
Regiments succeeded regi- 
ments, tanks succeeded 
tanks. The flag s bowed be- 
fore the Chief of State and 
before the coffin. The crowd 
saluted the flags. Not an 
incident, not a false note. 
An entire people gave itself 
up to the spectacle of its 
unity and its grandeur. 
I believe, I am certain 



that such ceremonies, apart 
from being commanded by 
respect and gratitude, are 
exalting and bracing for a 
nation. "What makes u s a 
people is that we have done 
great things* together and 
that we want to do more." 
Now, they well knew, those 
former combatants of Af- 
rica and Italy who marked 
out the long route, they well 
knew that they had done a 
great thing under, the orders 
of Juin: wiping out defeat 
by renewing with victory. 
They remembered with joy 
that in those days they were 
fraternally united. Much 
more, on the esplanade of 
the Invalides they could 
contemplate at the same 
time their present force 
and their most noble past. 
Beyond the symbolic can- 
nons of the terrace, this 
splendid gold dome and 
this gracefully incur v ate 
facade invoked ancestors 
who had been incomparable 
artists and builders. In this 
crypt where their Chief 
would be buried, they knew 
that Juin would rejoin Na- 
poleon and Lyautey, Foch 
and Leclerc. 




Thus, France, on this 
glorious day of mourning, 
remem berg the ete rn a 1 
France. The French, who 
saw in these moving rites, 
the living image of the 
great things ddne together 
throughout the milleniums, 
thought confusedly of the' 
great pacific tasks awaiting 
them. They forget that 
which at times divided them 
and felt only that which 
drew them together. In 
spite of the icy wind which 
swept the esplanade, one 
felt pass, invisible and un- 
animous, a powerful cur- 
rent of honor and love. 
Marshal Juin, and his sol-

AMERICA'S LARGEST SELLING 
CHAM DfOOOftANT 





EVER HEAR of "leg-o* mutton sleeves*' or the 
"wasp waistline"? These phrases and others 
tike puff sleeves, dirndl skirt, raglan mountings, 
gathered shoulders and bustle, dotted the des- 
criptions of fashionable wear shortly before the 
outbreak of the second World War. 

Fashion dispatches from New York and Eu- 
rope were reprinted in Manila's, "The Tribune." 
They gave the trends — ™ f m m straight pencil skirts 
for long- sleeved dinner gowns. . . afternoon 
dresses in rich fabrics are reviving the short 
evening gowns* . , the military influence as seen 
in women's styles that feature belts and tailor- 
ed pockets ** 

And because Manila was a cosmopolitan 
city, these foreign styles were sported by the 
women of .society. 

The wasp waist was a very tight waistline, 
often achieved by a set-in band, This went with 
gathered shoulders, eoOarless necklines and- big 
patch pockets. The leg-o* mutton sleeves showed 
full sleeves near the shoulder that gradually 
narrowed as the3" reached the elbows and from 
the elbows gradually became skin tight until 
the wrists. The wasp waist and the leg-o' mut- 
ton sleeves were seen both in casual wear and 
in evening dresses. 

The favored necklines were V and square 
necklines. V necklines either had sports collars 
or no collars. Peter Pan collars and small point- 
ed collars like those of dress shirts appeared 
even in evening wear. 

The skirts for evening dresses were gathered 
or in "full balloon.** For day wear they were us- 
ually in six pieces or were gathered. Favored 
travel clothes were the culottes which were 
combined with a fitted long torso blouse with 
puff sleeves or leg-o* mutton sleeves. The eve- 
ning skirts emerged from bands across the waist- 
line and down from the long torso. Skirt lengths 
for casual wear were anywhere from three to 
five inches below the knees. 

The blouses were either tucked in, tailored 
or were worn loose over the skirt. Boleros were 
also in style. They usually matched the dress 
and had sleeves. Often a bolero was simulated 
but it actually was part of the dress and was 
achieved through combination of material. 



The socialites 

The native terno had its own styles too. A 
benefit Christmas ball of the Philippine Social 
Services Inc. (where many of Manila's young 
women graduates were members and took active 
part) had a fashion spread showing the 1941 
styles. The camisa and the panuelo were still 
with the temo but most of the terhos were long 
torso and belted, or just belted. To quote the re- 
ports *\ . . Deiy Rodriguez wore a draped skirt 
with flowers at the waist. Snowballs and sequins 
decorated the camisa and panuelo. ; . Chona Rec- 
to showed the bare midriff influence in her *'belle 
of the ball terno/* (It was black and white,) The 
upper part of the camisa and panuelo and the 
lower part of the wide skirt were in white 
cut-work. While the 'midriff (the lower part of 
the camisa and panuelo and the upper part of 
the skirt )'was in .black. . , Purita Mcntinola wore 
a long torso temo. This was belted and sequined. 
Telly Albert was in a curtain drape skirt and 

slit camisa sleeves Ma.Luisa Ledesma was in 

moire shark skin with front accents striped in 
sequins.'* 

Hairdos and shoestyles 

To go with these styles were the different 
hairstyles. Curls were having heydey but milady 
could fix her hair in either the page-boy or rolls. 
Rolls could be found at the temple on top of both 
ears and rolled up all around to show the nape 
of tbte neck. Another hair style' (which was not 
recommended for the* lady with a „ broad face) 
consisted in parting the hair in the middle, and

GUERRERO NAKPIL 

VETERANS' DISCLAIMER 

IT WAS A HARD, and although the worst was 
yet to come, bitter summer. Manila was full 
of lassitude and despair* We could hear, from 
across the bay, the booming of guns, and in the 
evenings, along the boulevard, caref ully hidden be- 
hind the old trees, we watched the fitful glare 
of battle in Bataan and Corregidor. The Japanese 
sentries did not like our gazing across the water 
^perhaps it reminded them where our loyalties 
lay. They waved us away with their guns and 
we moved back dumbly. 

The war had begun four months before, the 
morning after, I remember with absurd irrele- 
vance, a big university dance. Across the Luneta, 
the bombs fell on Intramuros and Sto. Domingo 
in a daytime raid, v and the boys I grew up 
with, cousins, beaux, friends of my brothers came 
to say goodbye, their manner as new as their 
battle unifoffeis and the gay, green plumelets of 
camouflage in their helmets. They grinned self- 
consciously and wrung my hands in sweaty palms, 
all of us- who had known only debutante balls 
and cadet parades and basketball leagues, awkward 
and unaccustomed to danger and sorrow. 

I gave one of them — the. boy who, a gaunt, 
burnt, weary prisoner of war, was to become my 
husband a few months later — a tin of English 
tea biscuits and a fluffy cashmere sweater. 1 
visualized gentleman-soldier fighting among 
trumpets and silk banners. How little did we know 
the war he was going to I 

The women and children were bundled off 
quickly afterwards to the provinces for the "eva- 
cuation" decreed by civil defense, but as soon as 
Manila was declared an open city, we returned, 
unable to tear ourselves even in the face of dis- 
aster from the city we loved. The retreat from 
eastern Luzon had begun, and by night the 
heavy tanks moved down Mabini street. Still 
clinging to our teenage habits, the boys telephon- 
ed from every stop, frcm McKinley and from 
Caloocan. From San Miguel de Mayumo, they 
said, "We're blowing up the bridge and going in. 
You won't hear from us for some time." 

The next night, the tanks moving down our 
street had a different, unfamiliar sound. They 
were Japanese! And the morning light revealed a 
whole detachment of soldiers, squat, unkempt and 
ragged, camped along the sidewalks of Mabini. 
Their stench rose to the shuttered windows be- 
hind which we watched. They washed at the fire 
hydrants, sprawled on the pavement in their loin- 
cloths and shouted gibberish to each other. For 
such a contemptible enemy to have defeated our 
nice, young USAFFE boys. 

The enemy! He reduced life overnight to its 
barest essentials by taking most of what there 
was to eat, drink, wear or ride in, and he add- 
ed unimagined refinements. The Japanese gardener 
who had . come regularly to tend the roseplants 
was riding around in a well-cut uniform and a 
big, black car. Perhaps it was he who was be- 
hind the denunciation that we were operating a 
radio transmitter and the military police raid that 
ended with the destruction of a sinister wire 
trellis in our azotea that broadcast nothing but 
the sctnt of jasmines. A Japanese Catholic bishop 
came to call with a letter from a friend, and 
after I had pointedly flounced out of the room, ( 
my father said quietly, Lo cortes no quit* io 
valient e* 

But nobody else was worrying about my man- 
ere. The little radio which we had hidden from 
the confiscation order took most of our time and

L 




attention. It kept us informed of the enemy's 
power and of his perfiy, but told us little of 
' our impending defeat— although it was so easy to 
guess beneath the McArthurian phrases — until that 
[ black Thursday afternoon when the Voice of Ba- 
L titan, tired and suddenly distant, announced the 
' Fall. 

After many harrowing months filled with the 
nightmare of the Death March and the prison 
•camp at Capas, during which we sent eggs and 
[ sulfa tablets and scribbled notes that neVer reach- 
ed their destinations, the boys who had gone to 
Bataan were back as strange old men and, more 
often, not at all. Emaciated, or swollen from be- 
riberi, sunburned sullen, they were not fond 
of talking. Oh yes, they said upon being prod- 
ded, Butch was bayoneted while out on patrol, 
I and Henry was captured and decapitated, Tito 
and Loy took shrapnel in their lungs, and Ning 
died of dysentery, and Lito went mad and Ivio 
deserted, taking off in a hired banca from the 
coast of Mariveles, and we walked for miles and 
- ate nothing but a crate of onions for weeks, 
and climbed mountains and dug trenches and 
manned machineguns and then, crying like chil- 
' dren, we surrendered and Ron made a fortune 
f selling drugs in Capas, and the boys died like 
[ flies, although Luis learned to cook lizards and 
field mice* 

Nor did I want to listen. We had secrets 
I from each other, the secrets of grief and fear. 
We — our generation and our country* — were never 
to be the same again. A veil was sent and our 
innocence shatered forever in a mess of filth 
and blood and broken faith. 

It is for those who never did lose that in- 
I nocence, as well as for those of us who, in 
other ways, did not survive its loss that E 
should like to ask now that we renounce all ve- 
terans' claims against the U.S.A. Most of the 
young men to whom those claims are owed have 
been dead these many years, the sons and daugh- 
ters they never saw now fully grown without 
their care. The survivors are mostly disappointed, 
aging men who have long ago writen off the 
cost of that obsolete valor. To continue to drag 
their cause from anteroom to anteroom in Wash- 
ington is somehow to do them an injustice. Who 
wants two more pesos for every wretched, cower- 
ing minute of that war that spent itself so 
Jong ago? Surely all we want is to be allowed 
to forget its cost. 




It is not in anger or despair that I make 
this suggestion, although, yes, perhaps with a 
touch of pride. It is not because it would be 
excellent tactics, or because we no longer need 
the money — for I know that many veterans' fam- 
ilies depend on it — nor because I have no per- 
sonal stake in it — I was a war widow with two 
children when the war ended — nor because the 
claims have remained unpaid for so long and are 
quite likely never going to be paid, but only be- 
cause, thinking of that summer of 1942, I know 
that no compensation could ever have been pro- 
portionate to what we lost, and that the only 
course, at least this once more, is to be as 
foolish and headlong, as gallant and generous as 
those boys in Bataan. 

Let the Americans keep their money, and 
let us keep snug about us our new wisdom: all 
alliances made out of sentiment or greed are, in 
the end, always base, We Filipinos are our coun- 
try's own best friends. If we have our own 
friendship, we need no other.

Lt. Marcos had hardly re- 
ported back to duty when 
he and his men went out on 
another patrol. Exhausted 
and consequently careless," 
they allowed a Japanese pa • 
trol to surprise them /rom 
oehmd. They were quickly 
disarmed and later mauled 
by gun butts. Marcos and 
nis men were tied and left 
with two enemy sentries 
But Marcos managed to un- 
tie himself, got rid of the 
guards, freed his men and 
then returned once more to 
friendly lines. 

The success of the Mar- 
cos mission deprived the in- 
filtrating Japanese column 
of mortar cover and the ad- 
vance wa 5 stopped and then 
driven back. 

For tni s adventure Lt 
Marcos was awarded the 
Silver Star. 

The citation read: "(Lt 
Marcos) with three men at ' 
tacked and dislodged a 
greatly superior en 
fcrce which had captured 
the outposts and machine 
gun emplacements of the 
21st Infantry in reserve 
culminating i n driving the 

f ne ^ y u back wh0 ha <* infil- 
trated the bivouac. Hi s cool- 
ness of conduct under fire 
exemplary courage and ut- 
ter disregard for his person- 
Zj&fty Aspired the men 
under him to act like veter- 
an soldiers." 



After this citation, Third 
Lt. Marcos was promoted to 
First Lieutenant. Only four 
day s later, Lt. Marcos ran 
>nto a Japanese force driv- 
ing a wedge into the USAF- 
* n. s 51st division. The 51st 
was exhausted at this point 
and hardly i„ a position to 
aunch another counterat- 
tack. 

The citation recommend- 
ing Lt. Marcos for the Con- 
gressional Medal of Honor 
read: 

"In disregard for his per- 
sonal safety, notwithstand- 
ing the fact he had just been 
captured by the enemy and 
tortured, realizing the de- 
fense of the Salian junction 

n«i™ ial to ^ e nUre

stragglers from the 51st Di- 
ision, with which he fought 



his way to the junction of

defense block against the 
Japanese elements of the

and hi s men fought their

MARCOS'. 
A LIVING 
LEGEND 



i T 

L In 



FERDINAND E. MARCOS of the 21st 
fan try Division could hare been the 
only Filipino soldier in Bataan in 1942 to win 
the Congressional Medal of Honor But the 
papers recommending him for the medal, 
signed by General Wainwright, were lost in the 
last days of the battle of Bataan. 



Lt. Marcos' exploits in 
Bataan are legendary. On 
New Year's day, 1942 he 
ambushed a company of 
Japanese 1 army cyclists (the 
bicycles were collapsible) 
as they were advancing to- 
wards Bataan in the north. 
After the ambush, Lt. Mar- 
cos salvaged a Japanese 
samurai sword and sent it 
to Brig. General Manuel 
Roxas, aid to General Mac- 
Arthur. Roxas, in turn, sent 
it to President Roosevelt in 
America. 

Conducting intelligence 
patrol s behind Japanese 
iine s in Bataan became 
standard procedure for 
young Lt. Marcos. In one of 
these patrols, he was hit by 
sniper fire, but carved out 
the bullet himself with his 
knife and then crawled back 
to his lines 

By the middle of January, 
Japanese columns v had in- 
filtrated along the slopes of 
Mount Silanganan. The ad- 
vancing Japanese were sup- 
ported by punishing 70mm. 
mortar fire. The mortar 
fire pinned down General 
Capinpin's 21st Division

and Lt. Marcos volunteered 
to silence the battery of 
mortars, 

Lt. Marco s led a counter- 
attack with the support of .

Marcos and his three sold-

posed of the artillery corn- 4

hand grenades to take care 
of the rest of the Japanese 
troopers. Then they shoved 
the mortars from their em- 
placements over the cliff at 
Mt. Natib. After that, they 
raced madly for the forest 
and made good their escape 
through a river.
