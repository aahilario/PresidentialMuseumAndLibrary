The President and Members 
Board of Directors 
Manila Jockey Club, Inc, 

Felix Huertas, Manila 

Gentlemen; 

I wish to thank the representatives of your Club who have 
assisted me in my efforts to resist the carrying into effect of the 
proposal to compel us to divide all our races equally between the 
two racing clubs without at least requiring the Philippine Racing 
Club to guarantee us the same earnings which we obtain when holding 
races in San Lazaro. Our fight on this subject-matter began early 
in February, 1954 and did not reach its climax until May 20th, 
Throughout this long period Director Thomas M. Lichauco and your 
attorney, Marcial P. Lichauco, were in constant touch with me and 
helped me defend the interestâ€™s of our Society. Your President, 

Don Piafael Roces, personally interviewed members of the Senate to 
prevent an injustice being done to us, 

Although we did not succeed in preventing the enactment of 
H. So, 2053, I am satisfied that, as finally approved with the 
amendments prepared by attorney Lichauco, the interests of our So- 
ciety and the other charitable institutions are well protected. 

Sincerely yows. 


BASILIO J, VALDES
